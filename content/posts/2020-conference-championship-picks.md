### Buccaneers @ Packers

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Buccaneers** (30) @ Saints (20)  
Rams (18) @ **Packers** (32)

#### _Conference Rank_

Buccaneers (5)  
Packers (1)

#### _Weather_

Cold, cloudy, and slightly windy with a thin blanket of snow expected to cover the field in the morning. Not good for a Tampa team used to warm, humid weather.

#### _Injuries_

Packers are mostly healthy. Starting cornerback Kevin King may not be in the game. Even if he starts, his presence on defense may be limited. Let's also not forget that David Bakhtiari will no longer be playing for Green Bay this postseason due to injury. It's a past injury worth noting considering he's been considered one of the NFL's best left tackles.

Buccaneers will be missing the services of a key weapon in Antonio Brown. His presence on the team will be missed, though it's certain Tampa will find ways to compensate for his absence through skill players like Scottie Miller and Cameron Brate.

#### _History / Analysis_

Packers and Buccaneers faced each other once before during the regular season, but it's a game that doesn't hold much meaning here. It's been argued that Green Bay wasn't prepared at all for the litany of blitzes Todd Bowles would throw against their offense. Not to mention they weren't ready for Tampa's ground game, given Ronald Jones had his best rushing performance of the season against these Packers.

This week's game will clearly be different for a number of reasons, not least of which being that these are the conference championships. Both organizations will be taking this game very seriously. In that respect, the Packers have so much more going in their favor - home field advantage, weather

**New Orleans covers if**  
their pass rushers can keep Jalen Hurts hemmed in the pocket. The Saints defensive linemen need to mount pressure mostly through bull rushes. It wouldn't be the first time this season New Orleans sustained a pass rush solely off bull rushes.

**Philadelphia covers if**  
Jalen Hurts actually ends up impressing against one of the league's best defenses. It's remotely possible if he's allowed to break from the pocket and run at will.
