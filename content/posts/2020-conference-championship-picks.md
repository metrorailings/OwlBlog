### Buccaneers @ Packers

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Buccaneers** (30) @ Saints (20)  
Rams (18) @ **Packers** (32)

#### _Conference Rank_

Buccaneers (5)  
Packers (1)

#### _Weather_

Cold, cloudy, and slightly windy with a thin blanket of snow expected to cover the field in the morning. Not good for a Tampa team used to warm, humid weather.

#### _Injuries_

Packers are mostly healthy. Starting cornerback Kevin King may not be in the game. Even if he starts, his presence on defense may be limited. Let's also not forget that David Bakhtiari will no longer be playing for Green Bay this postseason due to injury. It's a past injury worth noting considering he's been considered one of the NFL's best left tackles.

Buccaneers will be missing the services of a key weapon in Antonio Brown. His presence on the team will be missed, though it's certain Tampa will find ways to compensate for his absence through skill players like Scottie Miller and Cameron Brate. On a more positive note, Vita Vea will be coming back for the first time in months.

#### _History / Analysis_

Packers and Buccaneers faced each other once before during the regular season, but it's a game that doesn't hold much meaning here. It's been argued that Green Bay wasn't prepared at all for the litany of blitzes Todd Bowles would throw against their offense. Not to mention they weren't ready for Tampa's ground game, given Ronald Jones had his best rushing performance of the season against these Packers.

This week's game will clearly be different for a number of reasons, not least of which being that these are the conference championships - both teams will be taking this game very seriously this time around. In that respect, the Packers have so much more going in their favor - home field, tundra weather, an elite quarterback, more elite defensive linemen, and better coaching. To be fair, Tampa Bay has more potential on offense as well as a history staging successful comebacks. It's been those two strengths that's carried them through the playoffs so far. Still, I think all of Green Bay's advantages will be too much for these underwhelming Buccaneers to overcome. Unless Brady plays at an otherworldly level, the Packers will be stamping their ticket to the Super Bowl by the time the fourth quarter ends.

One more thing worth noting - Matt LaFleur has shown a penchant for drafting some damn good plays to open up games. It's not a coincidence Green Bay's generally been opening up games with leads while he's been head coach. And I expect this game to be no different. Hell, despite the fact that just about everything went wrong for Green Bay in their regular season meeting with the Buccaneers, the Packers still managed to build up a ten-point lead prior to getting blown out. So putting some money on Green Bay in the first quarter may be worth a look here.

**Green Bay covers if**  
the Packers work out to a quick lead and ward off any comebacks the Buccaneers might try to stage. In order for the Packers to win this game comfortably, the Smith brothers and Rashan Gary will need to dominate the trenches and keep Tom Brady sweating in the pocket. The more heat Brady feels, the more his offense stalls, as simple as that.

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
their offensive line can keep Brady fairly comfortable in the pocket and Ronald Jones can chew off some big yardage against a Green Bay defense not known at all for muzzling opposing rushers.
