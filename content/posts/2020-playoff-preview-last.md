After the division round concluded, things are becoming clearer to me. I was wondering if mental fortitude was just a hokey metric I conceived to try and explain that (mostly) undefinable quality championship teams tend to have. In all honesty though, I think I'm on the right track, but I need to better purpose that metric with respect to the rest of the playoff potential model. Mental fortitude is a plus, but it's not some tremendous advantage. It should be valued roughly as much as sound coaching or a talented roster.

Therefore, I'll be using the number of times a team has successfully come back against an opponent in the fourth quarter or from a double-digit deficit as an imperfect measure of mental strength. The more successful campaigns a team can stage from a disadvantageous position during the regular season, the more likely they are to be a confident bunch heading into the playoffs. Combine that with this fluid notion of momentum and I think we have a fairly accurate gauge for a team's overall mental fortitude.

On top of that, I decided coaches will get factored into the scoring as well. Little risky, sure, but good coaches have been following through and planning well in these games. Just like players, quality coaches generally succeed more often than not.
