All right, so wild card weekend passed and the one thing that was abundantly clear was that my model is messy. It's not accurately capturing the playoff potential of any of the postseason teams. The whole "mental fortitude" metric I introduced this year hasn't quite panned out - Cleveland demolishing Pittsburgh and Baltimore coming back from a double-digit deficit against the Tennessee is proof enough that the metric has failed miserable in capturing that one "it" factor that separates the promising playoff teams from the rest of the pool.

I do want to test a different metric though, a metric that's loosely related to a team's overall confidence - momentum. Simply put, it's a measure of a team's overall mood entering the postseason. Is the organization entering the playoffs on a hot note? Or are they sadly backing their way into the playoffs, likely on a losing streak? Using this metric instead of a generic confidence rating would have probably helped me forecast the Ravens statement win over the Titans and Pittsburgh's humiliating loss against the Browns. It also would have helped explain so many of the unexpected upsets we saw over the past several years - the Packers with their Super Bowl run in 2010, the Giants with their own championship run back in 2011, the Titans with their historic upsets last year, etc.

So let's revise the playoff scoring chart, substituting the category of mental fortitude with momentum instead. Momentum can range from _cold_ to _hot_, with _negative_, _neutral_, and _positive_ serving as intermediary values in between those two extremes. Momentum will be gauged by assessing the team's last six relevant games and determining whether that team surpassed expectations. Another quality worth expecting is whether a team's recently experienced one of those rare moments where a spark was lit. It could be a sensational play, a key player returning triumphantly from injury, an almost-miraculous fourth-down conversion to keep the game alive, an organization coming together to weather catastrophic adversity...basically any moment that could lead a team to believe in themselves and their own potential.
