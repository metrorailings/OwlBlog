It's that time of the year again - time to start assessing the championship potential of all teams bound for the playoffs.

It's not an easy feat to try and predict what's going to happen in the postseason. For one thing, it's far from a science. The human element lends itself to a little bit too much variance. Teams sometimes don't come in nearly as well-prepared as they should, even though all it takes is one bad game for an outfit to be jettisoned out of postseason contention. Not to mention teams lacking playoff experience usually underwhelm in their first postseason outing, sometimes to the point where they end up losing unexpectedly. Add on top of that COVID precautions this year and you have a playoff picture rife with uncertainty.

Still, the forecasting model I've developed the past several years watching these playoffs has serious potential. It's based on principles that I've formulated watching the Giants make their unlikely Super Bowl run back in 2011. These principles have been tweaked here and there, but the spirit remains the same - for a team to win the Super Bowl, it needs to have a certain level of competency on offense, defense, and coaching. Sounds like a platitude, I know...but competency in all three areas is strictly defined in my model with simplified yes/no questions. So we do have a level of objectivity here when it comes to assessing teams.

Anyway, let's get things started.

## Pittsburgh Steelers

**_AFC 3rd/6th Seed_**

The Steelers can best be summed up as a ticking time bomb. Even though it took over ten weeks for them to record their first loss, that loss pulled the one loose thread keeping the whole operation together. Ever since then, Pittsburgh's spiraled into a losing streak.

It's not exactly hard to figure out why either. The Steelers offense is truly one dimensional. Pittsburgh doesn't run the ball with any sort of efficacy, nor do they really employ any gadgetry to try and deceive opposing defenses. On top of that, the passing game is neutered - Ben Roethlisberger and his weapons have been largely limiting themselves to short (and uninspiring) passes.  It's these quick throws that have been the one defining feature of their offense. And an offense limited to only one vector of attack can be deciphered very easily, as we've seen the past several weeks.

Dominant defenses can't carry teams alone to the promised land, especially when these teams lack home field advantage or mental toughness. Speaking of which...their conviction needs to be questioned. The team has fallen apart the past several weeks. Should this trend continue across the last two weeks of the regular season, that lack of fortitude combined with a dud offense will likely result in this team making an early exit from the playoffs.

## New Orleans Saints

**_NFC 2nd/3rd Seed_**

New Orleans has some respectable talent across their team, though much of it is concentrated on the defensive side of the ball. The offense has been trending down the last couple of years, especially in their recent playoff appearances. The biggest reason why is their franchise quarterback - it's been all too clear the past couple seasons that Drew Brees is navigating through the tail end of his career. His arm strength, accuracy, and decisiveness have all declined considerably. His aging issues are likely to be exacerbated going into January given the state of his ribs. Ultimately, this offense hasn't been anywhere near as sharp as one'd expect out of a Saints team coached by Sean Payton.

Still, it's not like the offense is as putrid as what we see in Pittsburgh. Payton's offensive concepts and their offensive line have kept this offense humming most of the year. The model takes that into account in declaring this organization as legitimate contenders for the Super Bowl.

Still, a few things need to be said concretely if this team is to finally realize its hope for a second Super Bowl invitation. One, they need to definitively prove that they can mentally steel themselves against the rough waves they'll be traversing in the playoffs. Of the three times in the regular season where they overcame moments of high tension, those moments came against teams with losing records - the Lions, Chargers, and Panthers. Their only moment of commendable triumph over adversity came with Taysom Hill stepping in admirably for Drew Brees after the latter's ribs went splat. So frankly, respectable arguments can be made on both sides of the question as to whether the Saints are a mentally strong team. Second, Drew Brees will need to heal up quick and minimize his erratic plays. Easier said than done, I know. The offensive line can help him by giving the man air in the pocket, but even the best offensive linemen will let up every now and then, especially when matched up against some of the league's best defenses. So it's imperative Drew somehow manages the game well and let the rest of his team take charge, similar to what Peyton did the year he won the Super Bowl with the Broncos.

## Tampa Bay Buccaneers

**_NFC 5th/6th Seed_**

The Buccaneers have been been riding some serious ebbs and flows through the season. Luckily, that turbulence actually gives us quite a bit of insight into the team, especially when it comes to their mental fortitude.

Let's start with the positives here - the talent. Barely anybody doubted the talent on this team before the season even started for good reason - the team was pluck full of talent before Brady graced Tampa with his almighty presence. A few more big names were added to the roster after the Brady signing, but it's been the existing athletes that kept the Buccaneers functioning at a high level - Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Jason Pierre-Paul, William Gholston, Shaquil Barrett, Devin White, etc.

The Buccaneers also had moments where they demonstrated mental toughness, notably in the comebacks they've staged against the likes of the Chargers, the Packers, the Giants, and the Falcons. Not much of a surprise that this team exhibits mental fortitude, considering Brady and Bruce Arians are the two captains of the organization.

Where this team ultimately falls short is the coaching and the quarterbacking. Sorry to say it, but Tom Brady's no elite quarterback. He's been pretty good, but he's made way too many wack throws and bad decisions this year to be considered great. Not to mention that his composure as a passer literally shatters under pressure. On top of that, the coaching acumen isn't quite there either. Neither Arians nor Todd Bowles have shown me they can adequately adjust on the fly. If anything, both of them cling a little too tightly to their philosophies of football. Normally, that's not a bad thing when the players can consistently execute on those philosophies...but their roster isn't loaded with enough talent to adopt a brand of football driven more by ideology than situation. Conceptual complexity and scheme flexibility needs to be incorporated into this team's playbooks so that these Bucs could use the element of surprise to throw opposing teams off their game. Unfortunately, that's not the case, from what I've seen.

A very good team loaded with talent, but their deficiencies at quarterback and coaching will probably be the death of them in the postseason.

## Seattle Seahawks

***

It's hard to develop a beat on these Seahawks. It really is hard. Namely, it's the fact that the Seahawks waxed and waned through the season. Seattle has turned things up lately with solid performances against poor teams and homely wins over good teams. 

The most confusing part of this team is the defense. An argument can be made that their defense has fared much better the past several games, but none of those performances came against truly quality offenses. On top of that, it remains to be seen whether we have truly dominant trench defenders on this team - things are pretty damning when the best pass rusher on your team is a defensive back that's missed four games. In all fairness, the defensive line has multiple players who have stepped up on several occasions, but no one player has shown consistent dominance through the season. Arguably the most reliable pass rushing lineman has been Jarren Reed, a defensive tackle. Carlos Dunlap has been a bit of a boon to the pass rush since his arrival, but I'm still not fully sold on him being considered elite yet.

Offensively, things are a little murky there as well. First off, Russell Wilson's quarterbacking ability dropped off a cliff the moment he trademarked that dumb slogan "Let Russ cook". His best moments came early in the season, because the last couple months haven't been kind to him - outside of one or two games, his play's been pretty unremarkable. A few pretty passes here and there, but nothing consistent. The hallmark of an elite quarterback is a sustained commitment to excellence. A few lackluster games here or there are acceptable, but a series of bad games cannot be so easily excused. Unless Russell has been hiding an injury that will magically go away come playoffs, I can't count on him as an elite quarterback, period.

It's not just Russell that's giving me fits in reading this offense. It's the weaponry as well. The only certain noteworthy weapon
