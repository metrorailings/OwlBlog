It's that time of the year again - time to start assessing the championship potential of all teams bound for the playoffs.

It's not an easy feat to try and predict what's going to happen in the postseason. For one thing, it's far from a science. The human element lends itself to a little bit too much variance. Teams sometimes don't come in nearly as well-prepared as they should, even though all it takes is one bad game for an outfit to be jettisoned out of postseason contention. Not to mention teams lacking playoff experience usually underwhelm in their first postseason outing, sometimes to the point where they end up losing unexpectedly. Add on top of that COVID precautions this year and you have a playoff picture rife with uncertainty.

Still, the forecasting model I've developed the past several years watching these playoffs has serious potential. It's based on principles that I've formulated watching the Giants make their unlikely Super Bowl run back in 2011. These principles have been tweaked here and there, but the spirit remains the same - for a team to win the Super Bowl, it needs to have a certain level of competency on offense, defense, and coaching. Sounds like a platitude, I know...but competency in all three areas is strictly defined in my model with simplified yes/no questions. So we do have a level of objectivity here when it comes to assessing teams.

Anyway, let's get things started.

***

## Pittsburgh Steelers

**_AFC 3rd/6th Seed_**

The Steelers can best be summed up as a ticking time bomb. Even though it took over ten weeks for them to record their first loss, that loss pulled the one loose thread keeping the whole operation together. Ever since then, Pittsburgh's spiraled into a losing streak.

It's not exactly hard to figure out why either. The Steelers offense is truly one dimensional. Pittsburgh doesn't run the ball with any sort of efficacy, nor do they really employ any gadgetry to try and deceive opposing defenses. On top of that, the passing game is neutered - Ben Roethlisberger and his weapons have been largely limiting themselves to short (and uninspiring) passes.  It's these quick throws that have been the one defining feature of their offense. And an offense limited to only one vector of attack can be deciphered very easily, as we've seen the past several weeks.

Dominant defenses can't carry teams alone to the promised land, especially when these teams lack home field advantage or mental toughness. Speaking of which...their conviction needs to be questioned. The team has fallen apart the past several weeks. Should this trend continue across the last two weeks of the regular season, that lack of fortitude combined with a dud offense will likely result in this team making an early exit from the playoffs.

EDIT: So Pittsburgh staged a huge comeback against the Colts in their second to last week. It was a much-needed win. Not only did that win give the Steelers some semblance of confidence heading into the postseason, but it also gave them the division crown, giving them a chance to rest some of their wearier members of their roster before playoffs begin.

I've also reassessed their mental fortitude and I do think this team actually has some serious mental strength. On four different occasions this season have they staged comebacks. In the midst of all that, the team's had to deal with some brutal scheduling spots given COVID impacting a few of their opponents. Yet, the Steelers have managed to weather the storm and secure the entry into the postseason as the third seed. So give them some credit here when it comes to mental strength.

On top of that, that game proved to me Diontae Johnson's deserving of premiere status. Pittsburgh's comeback was sparked by Ben making a long throw to him in tight coverage. On top of that, the last few weeks has also shed some light on his role in the offense - it's clear Pittsburgh has gone out of its way to gin up his share of targets, despite all his drops. So long as Diontae can shake off his bad dropping habit, he can actually add considerable value to this offense as a deep threat.

## New Orleans Saints

**_NFC 2nd/3rd Seed_**

New Orleans has some respectable athletes across the roster, though many of their better players are concentrated on the defensive side of the ball. The offense has been trending down the last couple of years, especially in their recent playoff appearances. The biggest reason why is their franchise quarterback - it's been all too clear the past couple seasons that Drew Brees is navigating through the tail end of his career. His arm strength, accuracy, and decisiveness have all declined considerably. His aging issues are likely to be exacerbated going into January given the state of his ribs. Ultimately, this offense isn't anywhere near as sharp as one'd expect out of a Saints team coached by Sean Payton. That being said, it's not like the offense is anywhere close to being horrendous either. Payton's offensive concepts combined with the sheer talent of Taysom Hill, Alvin Kamara, and their offensive linemen have kept the Saints offense humming most of the year.

However, a few things need to be said if this team is to finally realize its dreams for a second Super Bowl invitation. One, they need to definitively prove they can mentally steel themselves against the rough waves they're bound to see in the postseason. As things stand right now, I can only have a moderate level of confidence in the organization's mental fortitude. A little surprising given the Saints have a reputation for grit, but their record this year isn't quite as definitive as I'd like. Yes, the Saints have overcome double-digit deficits and produced game-winning drives on four occasions this season, but they also let up a double-digit point advantage against the Raiders and failed to manufacture a go-ahead drive in the fourth-quarter in a critical game against the Packers. Also worth mentioning is their shaky win over the Bears - even though New Orleans ultimately triumphed in overtime, it wasn't a pretty victory given the Bears were down by ten points midway through the fourth quarter. Their greatest moment overcoming adversity this year came when Taysom Hill played respectably in relief of Drew Brees, who was sidelined multiple weeks with cracked ribs.

And speaking of which, that leads to the other thing I want to state about this team - Drew Brees needs to heal up quick and minimize his erratic plays in order for this organization to realize their championship hopes. Easier said than done, I know. The offensive line can help him by giving him a pocket with plenty of cushion, but even the best linemen will give up pressure every now and then, especially against some of the league's best defenses. So it's important Drew somehow manages the offense well and lets his skill players take charge, similar to what Peyton did the year he won the Super Bowl with the Broncos.

## Tampa Bay Buccaneers

**_NFC 5th/6th Seed_**

The Buccaneers have been been riding some serious ebbs and flows through the season. Luckily, that turbulence actually gives us quite a bit of insight into the team, especially when it comes to their mental fortitude.

Let's start with the positives here - the talent. Barely anybody doubted the talent on this team before the season even started for good reason - the team was pluck full of talent before Brady graced Tampa with his almighty presence. A few more big names were added to the roster after the Brady signing, but it's been the tenured athletes that kept the Buccaneers functioning at a high level - Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Jason Pierre-Paul, William Gholston, Shaquil Barrett, Devin White, etc.

The Buccaneers also had moments where they demonstrated mental toughness, notably in the comebacks they've staged against the likes of the Chargers, the Packers, the Giants, and the Falcons. Not much of a surprise that this team exhibits mental fortitude, considering Brady and Bruce Arians are the two captains of the organization.

Where this team ultimately falls short is the coaching and the quarterbacking. Sorry to say it, but Tom Brady's no elite quarterback. He's been pretty good, but he's made way too many wack throws and bad decisions this year to be considered great. Not to mention his composure as a passer literally shatters under pressure. On top of that, the coaching acumen isn't quite there either. Neither Arians nor Todd Bowles have shown me they can adequately adjust on the fly - if anything, both of them clung a little too tightly to their respective philosophies on football. Normally, that's not a bad thing when the players can consistently execute on those philosophies...but their roster isn't loaded with enough talent to adopt a brand of football driven more by ideology than situational context. Conceptual complexity and scheme flexibility needs to be incorporated into this team's playbooks so that these Tampa's players could use the element of surprise to throw opposing teams off their game. Unfortunately, that's not the case from what I've seen.

A very good team loaded with talent, but their deficiencies at quarterback and coaching will probably be the death of them midway through the postseason.

## Seattle Seahawks

***

It's hard to develop a beat on these Seahawks. It really is hard. Namely, it's the fact that the Seahawks waxed and waned through the season. Seattle has turned things up lately with solid performances against poor teams and homely wins over good teams.

The most confusing part of this team is the defense. An argument can be made that their defense has fared much better the past several games, but none of those performances came against truly quality offenses. On top of that, it remains to be seen whether we have truly dominant trench defenders on this team - things are pretty damning when the best pass rusher on your team is a defensive back that's missed four games. In all fairness, the defensive line has multiple players who have stepped up on several occasions, but no one player has shown consistent dominance through the season. Arguably the most reliable pass rushing lineman has been Jarren Reed, a defensive tackle. Carlos Dunlap has been a bit of a boon to the pass rush since his arrival, but I'm still not fully sold on him being considered elite yet.

Offensively, things are a little murky there as well. First off, Russell Wilson's quarterbacking ability dropped off a cliff the moment he trademarked that dumb slogan "Let Russ cook". His best moments came early in the season, because the last couple months haven't been kind to him - outside of one or two games, his play's been pretty unremarkable. A few pretty passes here and there, but nothing consistent. The hallmark of an elite quarterback is a sustained commitment to excellence. A few lackluster games here or there are acceptable, but a series of bad games cannot be so easily excused. Unless Russell has been hiding an injury that will magically go away come playoffs, I can't count on him as an elite quarterback, period.

It's not just Russell that's giving me fits in reading this offense. It's the weaponry as well. Outside of Russell Wilson with his mobility, the only undisputed premiere offensive weapon on the team is DK Metcalf. Arguments can be made in favor of Tyler Lockett and Chris Carson, but I still feel uneasy giving both players premiere status. Lockett was always supposed to be the team's deep threat, but it seems DK Metcalf has ripped that designation away from him. He's still served admirably as the offense's second option at receiver, but I haven't seen enough to deem him as indispensable to this offense. To me, better arguments are made for Chris Carson. Carson has repeatedly shown off his talent this year chewing off yardage on the ground. He hasn't been too shabby either breaking tackles. Not to mention it seems Seattle's use of its tailbacks as receiving outlets has bailed them out a number of times in key games.

Lastly, there's the question of mental toughness. And things are so very hazy here. Seattle has only came back from a stressful deficit once in the season. That one comeback was later followed one week later by them ceding a lead to an upstart Arizona squad. I'm not sure if there's any other adverse situations for me to seriously consider here. The only other thing that could signify some mental fortitude here is the team's ability to manage penalties. Seattle's been far from egregious in that respect. Still, it's honestly not enough for me to give them any credit here when it comes to mental strength.

So we have a Seattle squad stocked with talent. It's the combination of Russell Wilson trending negatively and the lack of any evidence demonstrating mental toughness that has me a little wary of this team. I would have really liked this team as a dark horse contender, as it stands out, Seattle is just yet another team with considerable talent and not much else.

## Buffalo Bills

***

Buffalo is _probably_ the league's hottest offense, thanks in part to their elite quarterback. Josh Allen is likely to finish the year as the runner-up MVP, something that damn near nobody predicted before the season even started. His renaissance this year came due to two things - an appreciable improvement in his accuracy and Brian Daboll and Sean McDermott working together to install an offense truly catering to Josh Allen's skill set. Buffalo's offense is schematically designed to allow for easy passes over the middle to shifty receivers while availing passers the option to lob deep to receivers with large catch radiuses. It's a style of football conceived for a passer who won't necessarily awe you with his accuracy, to put it kindly. In that respect, this offense was bound to see a a major boost now that Stefon Diggs was brought into the fold to act as that one dominant wide receiver who could take the top off opposing defenses and catch those erratic passes Allen loves throwing. Josh Allen's jump up in accuracy this year was completely unexpected and elevated this offense to a whole another level.

If only Buffalo's defense could match their talent level on offense. Don't get me wrong, their secondary has some solid players, but it's the defensive front that's really missing juice. Not a single lineman or edge rusher have stood out this season. The raw statistics alone back up that disappointing fact. On top of that, watching tape hasn't really illuminated any elite talent flying under the radar. I see trench players popping up occasionally, but never with any sort of consistency.

On a slightly more positive note, the team possesses some noteworthy mental fortitude. Buffalo made two fourth-quarter comebacks against the Dolphins and the Rams and recovered from a double-digit deficit against the Jets. Now they did cede a fourth-quarter lead last minute against the Cardinals, but that was on a prayer throw.

So with all that said, Buffalo is a true contender for the Super Bowl this year. Vegas seems to recognize that as well, given their championship odds are only 8 to 1.

## Indianapolis Colts

***

Indianapolis was such a promising team entering 2020. In recruiting Philip Rivers, the hope was that the Colts had that final piece they so desperately needed to wage a championship run. Unfortunately, Rivers ended up being this team's biggest point of failure. Philip's last couple years was spent aging in dog years, considering his accuracy, decisiveness, and composure all dropped off a cliff. As a result, this offense is nowhere near as productive as I'd expect from a squad coached by Frank Reich.

The team's mental fortitude also needs to be questioned. Sure, the Colts bounced back from double-digit deficits against the Bengals and Packers (both teams featuring productive offenses), but then they went and blew a huge lead just recently against a Steelers team completely missing its mojo on offense. Looking elsewhere, another moment of adversity worth examining is the loss of star tailback Marlon Mack early in the season. It took a bit of time, but the Colts finally developed a suitable replacement in Jonathan Taylor. Consider that a testament to Reich's ability to compensate for critical injuries, something he surely picked up from his time over in Philly.

On defense, the team boasts solid talent at every level. It says something that Indianapolis is generally considered one of the better defenses in the league despite running a pretty simplistic scheme. That being said, the defensive front only harbors one elite player in DeForest Buckner. The stats alone would have been enough to justify his elite designation, but on tape, the man has consistently made impact plays. Justin Houston is another name worth mentioning given his name cache and the fact that by raw stats alone, his numbers bill him as the team's second best pass rusher. That being said, I'm still not sure if he can be included. Has he been able to maintain a high level of play through the season? Not too sure...the limited tape I've reviewed on the Colts doesn't really say much about him. Unless I've only watched his worst games this season, I feel better not registering him as an elite player.

All things said, the Colts are a damn good team, but having an albatross at quarterback and being somewhat short on the requisite amount of talent at certain position groups, a Super Bowl is out of the question. Expect them to give the Bills some hell though.

## Los Angeles Rams

***

Ah, the Rams. Not too long ago, they were the cream of the crop when it came to offensive football. Now...not so much. For one thing, elements of the Shanahan system have been adopted by so many other teams across the league that defenses finally figured out some solutions to counter many of the concepts and tricks it employs. Second (and more important), Jared Goff has a hard time playing a traditional brand of football in which the quarterback is simply expected to drop back, read the field, and make timely throws. Goff never had the type of mentality expected of an elite quarterback. Maybe it's his complete lack of composure under pressure or an inability to read defenses, but Goff can't be counted on to marshal this offense, especially in adverse moments.

And that's the other thing about these Rams - they haven't demonstrated any real mental toughness this year. Sure, they had one game-winning drive against the Buccaneers in Tampa Bay, but nothing else they've done this season signifies to me that the team can overcome adversity. Trying to win an elimination-style game against a decent Arizona squad in the last week of the regular season could have possibly been a triumphant moment for them given the magnitude of the moment and the fact that Jared Goff wouldn't be playing. But Kyler Murray leaving the game early due to injury effectively put an end to that contest - it didn't take much for the Rams to coast their way into the postseason.

Despite the quality coaching and the considerable talent along their defensive line, Los Angeles is destined for an early exit in the playoffs. Damn shame too - the Rams are one of the few playoff teams with solid coaching. Until their situation improves at quarterback and their offense features a bit more talent, the organization will never be a Super Bowl contender.

## Washington Football Team

***

Some sorry team was bound to win the NFC East. That shame went to Washington.

Still, it's not like Washington is completely undeserving. The team arguably boasts the best defensive line in the league. On top of that, Washington may be one of the mentally toughest organizations playing in the postseason. All the major adversities Washington faced this year would normally doom a team to absolute mediocrity - a head coach undergoing cancer treatment, a diva quarterback corrupting the organization, at least four different quarterbacks having to lead the team at various points in the season...all these things took a major toll on this team. Yet, they were able to will themselves to seven wins, literally just enough to win most garbage division in the league.

Washington's weaknesses can be found in its offense. Alex Smith is nowhere near an elite passer. And outside of Terry McLaurin, the offense probably doesn't have any other players who can be unquestionably deemed premiere weapons. Cam Sims and J.D. McKissic were names I thought were worthy of consideration for that honor, but neither of them have really popped off on tape to me. Their numbers don't inspire too much confidence either.  A valid argument can be made that both players (let alone others) can't be fairly judged given the chaotic situation at quarterback. Ultimately though, I'm bound to make a judgement based on what I see, so until I see truly definitive evidence otherwise, Washington only has one truly elite skill player among its offensive ranks.

Still, kudos to Washington's coaching squad for getting this team in line for a postseason appearance. Even more kudos should be awarded to their defensive braintrust for their willingness to adjust things schematically as the game progresses. All that said, Washington holds so much upset potential entering the playoffs. It's very plausible that Washington could end Tampa's season in the wild card round and even go as far as to make a splash in the division round.

## Tennessee Titans

***

The Titans are a bit of a fascinating bunch. A team with absolutely no defense, but everything else is just aces. The offense is beyond stacked - an elite quarterback, an all-pro tailback, two incredible wide receivers, and a dependable tight end to boot. Their mental cojones can't be questioned either - staging five comeback victories and weathering a massive COVID outbreak this year attests to the organization's mental fortitude.

If only Tennessee had a serviceable defense...although Harold Landry holds some potential. If Landry actually shapes up and the defense can finally develop something resembling a backbone, these Titans could be bound for the Super Bowl.

That being said, I can't give those folks in Nashville any credence here regarding their defense. All of their playoff potential comes from everything else except defense. The Titans stand as a fascinating case study of whether a team could go far into the playoffs even if their defense is absolutely pathetic entering the postseason. We shall see.

## Baltimore Ravens

***

It's weird analyzing these Ravens and seeing so many of the same problems they've suffered from last year. Last year's Ravens left the playoffs prematurely because the team never developed that mental toughness to mount comebacks from negative game script. I see the same issue this year.  This year's Baltimore squad only has one comeback victory. Contrast that with two losses in which fourth quarter leads were lost and you have a team potentially lacking resilience. On top of that, I noticed Lamar Jackson has a nasty habit of passing more than expected in losing games this season. It's a worrisome trend considering Lamar is specifically built to thrive through exotic rushing concepts. His skills as a passer are a little lacking, to say the least.  So anytime he attempts more than 25 passes, thing don't typically end well, yet another argument to this team's inability to adapt accordingly.

Honestly, a happy Ravens team is one free to rush the ball as it pleases while being in control of game script. But when forced to play from behind, the Ravens are no longer full of smiles - frankly, Baltimore isn't a team built to mount comebacks. The organization predicates its success on starting fast and building an insurmountable lead. It's a strategy I'm not sure the team can really leverage against a chain of quality opponents, especially considering the Ravens only clawed their way into the postseason as wild-card contenders. Without the benefit of home field advantage or an elite quarterback, it's virtually inevitable that Baltimore will find themselves sunk into a hole at least once this postseason. Without the requisite mental fortitude to climb out of these holes, the Ravens will be victim yet again to failed expectations.

## Cleveland Browns

***

It's tempting to ride money on Cleveland. From a talent level point of view, the team's stocked with talent at most of its position groups. On top of that, Kevin Stefansky has been great at turning this offense into one of the league's most proficient.

The problem for the Browns are manyfold. For one thing, Baker is definitely not an elite quarterback. He's had flashes of brilliance here and there, but the reality is that he's thriving thanks to Stefanski's own spin on the Shanahan/Kubiak system of offense. Take him away from Stefanski and put him on a team playing an uninspiring style of offense and Baker would be nothing but pedestrian.

Furthermore, Cleveland hasn't really demonstrated any mental fortitude through the season. As explosive as its offense has been recently, the reality is that the organization only managed to stage **one** fourth-quarter comeback this season, against the lowly Bengals. And really, that sole comeback is negated by their heartbreaking loss against Baltimore, where they ceded the lead late in the fourth quarter.

So given their questionable mental strength, it's not good that these Browns found themselves struck yet again with COVID. In response, the organization's been forced to close its training facilities and conduct practices virtually. Making matters worse, Stefansky caught the bug alongside a few of his players. Given so much of this roster will be playing in their first-ever postseason game, it's bad enough not being able to fully prepare, but not having the architect of your offense there to call plays is just rubbing salt in the wound at this point.

A few days ago, two of the Browns younger players were cited for drag racing. Maybe the charge was overblown...but at the same time, it's also pretty telling of where this team finds itself mentally. With all the recent adversity, the team needs to completely dialed in the moment just to stand a chance against an inveterate Pittsburgh outfit. I don't feel those vibes with these Cleveland squad. A wild-card loss is all but assured here.

## Chicago Bears

***

It's easy to rag on these Bears and MVP Mitch. Way too easy. Some even expect the Bears to be the worst team in the postseason - Chicago being slotted as ten-point underdogs against the Saints is testament alone to that.

In truth, the Bears are nowhere near as awful as I initially expected. Yes, Mitch is an awful quarterback. Truly awful. Chicago can still sustain something resembling an offense thanks to their two premiere weapons - tailback David Montgomery and wide receiver Allen Robinson. That being said, Chicago didn't build its resume this season off sensational offensive performances. No, the offense almost always played second fiddle to the real heart and soul of this team - the defense. I still remember that primetime showing against the Vikings where the Bear defense kept the team in contention through the whole game even though the offense was playing like it just woke up from a coma. For Chicago's defense to play at such a high level consistently despite their comrades on offense playing a style of football that can best be described as illegal....it's something special.

In fact, one can say that's a sign of a team with mental fortitude. I wouldn't definitively state this team is mentally tough, but Chicago has demonstrated resilience at tense moments through the season. On three different occasions has this team staged fourth-quarter comebacks. Contrast that with only one time the team ceded a fourth-quarter lead. And we can't forget that this team was in the throes of a quarterback controversy for the better part of the season, yet still did just enough to be invited into the postseason.

Don't get me wrong...I'm not saying Chicago is good enough to win matches in the playoffs. But to expect them to play like trash is a little far-fetched. Expect them to put up a decent fight against a Saints team still trying to find itself.

## Kansas City Chiefs

***

I'm personally biased against the Chiefs, as I'd rather not see a repeat champion this year. That being said, I try to be as objective as possible when evaluating teams in the context of my model. And according to my model, the Chiefs are truly something special. Arguably their only weak point is the lack of elite defensive linemen. It's a weakness that can be very much mitigated should Frank Clark could jump to the next level in the postseason, similar to what happened last year.

One could argue the team hasn't had their mettle tested as much this year compared to last, but I'd argue otherwise. Twice, they overcame double-digit deficits (with ease too). And twice, they've staged fourth-quarter comebacks against adequate competition. That comeback number goes up by one if you include the early-season meeting with the Chargers, but I'm not factoring that in here given Los Angeles had to literally start an unprepared rookie at quarterback last minute.

Combine the complete nature of their team with the fact that they've automatically been advanced to the division round and you have a team likely bound for the Super Bowl.

## Green Bay Packers

And we've arrived at the end. It's trite to say I've saved the best for last, but I think I might have with the Packers.

Green Bay has several things going for it. First, they have a truly phenomenal quarterback at the helm playing some of the best football of his life. They also have a healthy number of weapons at their disposal to matriculate the ball on offense. Most important of all though, the Packers **may** be one of those few postseason teams coming into the fray with a truly loaded defense. Notice I bolded "may" though in that last statement -  credible arguments can be honestly made to the contrary.

I've designated three players as elite defensive linemen. Nobody questions Za'Darius Smith's place on this list.  But the case can be made to doubt the other two players I've listed alongside him, Preston Smith and Rashan Gary.  All one has to do to argue against their inclusion in the chart is to reference their admittedly unimpressive stats. But go past the raw numbers and watch the tape. Both of them aren't necessarily out there racking up the sacks, hits, and tackles, but their impact is so palpable. The number of times they're out there making plays at key moments, rushing quarterbacks into ugly throws, forcing opposing tailbacks to cut back against the grain...the tape says it all. While their impact isn't quite obvious through metrics alone, it's there nonetheless through through their intangible influence. It's a bit of a risk, but I've seen enough tape to assert both players as elite.

So with three elite defensive linemen, a smart defensive coach in Mike Pettine, and a stacked offense, the team is almost fully complete. The other big way Green Bay falls short is their mental toughness. I've seen bits and pieces of their mental resolve this season, but I haven't quite seen enough evidence for me to declare them confidently as mentally strong. Erasing a big deficit against the Lions and coming back in the fourth quarter against the Jaguars are nice and all, but I need more than that. I guess we can also throw in that win against the Saints in a game that was tied going into the fourth quarter, but I still need one or two more moments like that to definitively assert them as mentally tough.

But with all that said, the key in them winning the Super Bowl is the emergence of Rashan Gary and Preston Smith as dominant linemen alongside Za'Darius Smith. If that's to happen, Green Bay is the favorite to take home the Lombardi in February.
