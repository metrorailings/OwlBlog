It's that time of the year again - time to start assessing the championship potential of all teams bound for the playoffs.

It's not an easy feat to try and predict what's going to happen in the postseason. For one thing, it's far from a science. The human element lends itself to a little bit too much variance. Teams sometimes don't come in nearly as well-prepared as they should, even though all it takes is one bad game for an outfit to be jettisoned out of postseason contention. Not to mention teams lacking playoff experience usually underwhelm in their first postseason outing, sometimes to the point where they end up losing unexpectedly. Add on top of that COVID precautions this year and you have a playoff picture rife with uncertainty.

Still, the forecasting model I've developed the past several years watching these playoffs has serious potential. It's based on principles that I've formulated watching the Giants make their unlikely Super Bowl run back in 2011. These principles have been tweaked here and there, but the spirit remains the same - for a team to win the Super Bowl, it needs to have a certain level of competency on offense, defense, and coaching. Sounds like a platitude, I know...but competency in all three areas is strictly defined in my model with simplified yes/no questions. So we do have a level of objectivity here when it comes to assessing teams.

Anyway, let's get things started.

## Pittsburgh Steelers

**_AFC 3rd/6th Seed_**

The Steelers can best be summed up as a ticking time bomb. Even though it took over ten weeks for them to record their first loss, that loss pulled the one loose thread keeping the whole operation together. Ever since then, Pittsburgh's spiraled into a losing streak.

It's not exactly hard to figure out why either. The Steelers offense is truly one dimensional. Pittsburgh doesn't run the ball with any sort of efficacy. Nor do they really employ any gadgetry to try and deceive opposing defenses. On top of that, the passing game is neutered - Ben Roethlisberger and his weapons have been largely limiting themselves to short passes.  It's these quick throws that have been the one defining feature of their offense. And an offense limited to only one vector of attack can be deciphered very easily, as we've seen the past several weeks.

So the Steelers come into the playoffs ass-backwards. Could they win a game? Sure. Will they advance to the Super Bowl? No chance. Dominant defenses can't carry teams alone to the promised land, especially without home field advantage. Still, as with all other playoff teams, we owe them a fair assessment here, if only to try and predict when they'll exit the postseason.
