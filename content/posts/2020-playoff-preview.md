It's that time of the year again - time to start assessing the championship potential of all teams bound for the playoffs.

It's not an easy feat to try and predict what's going to happen in the postseason. For one thing, it's far from a science. The human element lends itself to a little bit too much variance. Teams sometimes don't come in nearly as well-prepared as they should, even though all it takes is one bad game for an outfit to be jettisoned out of postseason contention. Not to mention teams lacking playoff experience usually underwhelm in their first postseason outing, sometimes to the point where they end up losing unexpectedly. Add on top of that COVID precautions this year and you have a playoff picture rife with uncertainty.

Still, the forecasting model I've developed the past several years watching these playoffs has serious potential. It's based on principles that I've formulated watching the Giants make their unlikely Super Bowl run back in 2011. These principles have been tweaked here and there, but the spirit remains the same - for a team to win the Super Bowl, it needs to have a certain level of competency on offense, defense, and coaching. Sounds like a platitude, I know...but competency in all three areas is strictly defined in my model with simplified yes/no questions. So we do have a level of objectivity here when it comes to assessing teams.

Anyway, let's get things started.

***

## Pittsburgh Steelers

**_AFC 3rd/6th Seed_**

The Steelers can best be summed up as a ticking time bomb. Even though it took over ten weeks for them to record their first loss, that loss pulled the one loose thread keeping the whole operation together. Ever since then, Pittsburgh's spiraled into a losing streak.

It's not exactly hard to figure out why either. The Steelers offense is truly one dimensional. Pittsburgh doesn't run the ball with any sort of efficacy, nor do they really employ any gadgetry to try and deceive opposing defenses. On top of that, the passing game is neutered - Ben Roethlisberger and his weapons have been largely limiting themselves to short (and uninspiring) passes.  It's these quick throws that have been the one defining feature of their offense. And an offense limited to only one vector of attack can be deciphered very easily, as we've seen the past several weeks.

Dominant defenses can't carry teams alone to the promised land, especially when these teams lack home field advantage or mental toughness. Speaking of which...their conviction needs to be questioned. The team has fallen apart the past several weeks. Should this trend continue across the last two weeks of the regular season, that lack of fortitude combined with a dud offense will likely result in this team making an early exit from the playoffs.

EDIT: So Pittsburgh staged a huge comeback against the Colts in their second to last week. It was a much-needed win. Not only did that win give the Steelers some semblance of confidence heading into the postseason, but it also gave them the division crown, giving them a chance to rest some of their wearier members of their roster before playoffs begin.

On top of that, that game proved to me Diontae Johnson's deserving of premiere status. Pittsburgh's comeback was sparked by Ben making a long throw to him in tight coverage. On top of that, the last few weeks has also shed some light on his role in the offense - it's clear Pittsburgh has gone out of its way to gin up his share of targets, despite all his drops. So long as Diontae can shake off his bad dropping habit, he can actually add considerable value to this offense as a deep threat.

## New Orleans Saints

**_NFC 2nd/3rd Seed_**

New Orleans has some respectable talent across their team, though much of it is concentrated on the defensive side of the ball. The offense has been trending down the last couple of years, especially in their recent playoff appearances. The biggest reason why is their franchise quarterback - it's been all too clear the past couple seasons that Drew Brees is navigating through the tail end of his career. His arm strength, accuracy, and decisiveness have all declined considerably. His aging issues are likely to be exacerbated going into January given the state of his ribs. Ultimately, this offense hasn't been anywhere near as sharp as one'd expect out of a Saints team coached by Sean Payton.

Still, it's not like the offense is as putrid as what we see in Pittsburgh. Payton's offensive concepts and their offensive line have kept this offense humming most of the year. The model takes that into account in declaring this organization as legitimate contenders for the Super Bowl.

Still, a few things need to be said concretely if this team is to finally realize its hope for a second Super Bowl invitation. One, they need to definitively prove that they can mentally steel themselves against the rough waves they'll be traversing in the playoffs. Of the three times in the regular season where they overcame moments of high tension, those moments came against teams with losing records - the Lions, Chargers, and Panthers. Their only moment of commendable triumph over adversity came with Taysom Hill stepping in admirably for Drew Brees after the latter's ribs went splat. So frankly, respectable arguments can be made on both sides of the question as to whether the Saints are a mentally strong team. Second, Drew Brees will need to heal up quick and minimize his erratic plays. Easier said than done, I know. The offensive line can help him by giving the man air in the pocket, but even the best offensive linemen will let up every now and then, especially when matched up against some of the league's best defenses. So it's imperative Drew somehow manages the game well and let the rest of his team take charge, similar to what Peyton did the year he won the Super Bowl with the Broncos.

## Tampa Bay Buccaneers

**_NFC 5th/6th Seed_**

The Buccaneers have been been riding some serious ebbs and flows through the season. Luckily, that turbulence actually gives us quite a bit of insight into the team, especially when it comes to their mental fortitude.

Let's start with the positives here - the talent. Barely anybody doubted the talent on this team before the season even started for good reason - the team was pluck full of talent before Brady graced Tampa with his almighty presence. A few more big names were added to the roster after the Brady signing, but it's been the tenured athletes that kept the Buccaneers functioning at a high level - Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Jason Pierre-Paul, William Gholston, Shaquil Barrett, Devin White, etc.

The Buccaneers also had moments where they demonstrated mental toughness, notably in the comebacks they've staged against the likes of the Chargers, the Packers, the Giants, and the Falcons. Not much of a surprise that this team exhibits mental fortitude, considering Brady and Bruce Arians are the two captains of the organization.

Where this team ultimately falls short is the coaching and the quarterbacking. Sorry to say it, but Tom Brady's no elite quarterback. He's been pretty good, but he's made way too many wack throws and bad decisions this year to be considered great. Not to mention his composure as a passer literally shatters under pressure. On top of that, the coaching acumen isn't quite there either. Neither Arians nor Todd Bowles have shown me they can adequately adjust on the fly - if anything, both of them clung a little too tightly to their respective philosophies on football. Normally, that's not a bad thing when the players can consistently execute on those philosophies...but their roster isn't loaded with enough talent to adopt a brand of football driven more by ideology than situational context. Conceptual complexity and scheme flexibility needs to be incorporated into this team's playbooks so that these Tampa's players could use the element of surprise to throw opposing teams off their game. Unfortunately, that's not the case from what I've seen.

A very good team loaded with talent, but their deficiencies at quarterback and coaching will probably be the death of them midway through the postseason.

## Seattle Seahawks

***

It's hard to develop a beat on these Seahawks. It really is hard. Namely, it's the fact that the Seahawks waxed and waned through the season. Seattle has turned things up lately with solid performances against poor teams and homely wins over good teams.

The most confusing part of this team is the defense. An argument can be made that their defense has fared much better the past several games, but none of those performances came against truly quality offenses. On top of that, it remains to be seen whether we have truly dominant trench defenders on this team - things are pretty damning when the best pass rusher on your team is a defensive back that's missed four games. In all fairness, the defensive line has multiple players who have stepped up on several occasions, but no one player has shown consistent dominance through the season. Arguably the most reliable pass rushing lineman has been Jarren Reed, a defensive tackle. Carlos Dunlap has been a bit of a boon to the pass rush since his arrival, but I'm still not fully sold on him being considered elite yet.

Offensively, things are a little murky there as well. First off, Russell Wilson's quarterbacking ability dropped off a cliff the moment he trademarked that dumb slogan "Let Russ cook". His best moments came early in the season, because the last couple months haven't been kind to him - outside of one or two games, his play's been pretty unremarkable. A few pretty passes here and there, but nothing consistent. The hallmark of an elite quarterback is a sustained commitment to excellence. A few lackluster games here or there are acceptable, but a series of bad games cannot be so easily excused. Unless Russell has been hiding an injury that will magically go away come playoffs, I can't count on him as an elite quarterback, period.

It's not just Russell that's giving me fits in reading this offense. It's the weaponry as well. Outside of Russell Wilson with his mobility, the only undisputed premiere offensive weapon on the team is DK Metcalf. Arguments can be made in favor of Tyler Lockett and Chris Carson, but I still feel uneasy giving both players premiere status. Lockett was always supposed to be the team's deep threat, but it seems DK Metcalf has ripped that designation away from him. He's still served admirably as the offense's second option at receiver, but I haven't seen enough to deem him as indispensable to this offense. To me, better arguments are made for Chris Carson. Carson has repeatedly shown off his talent this year chewing off yardage on the ground. He hasn't been too shabby either breaking tackles. Not to mention it seems Seattle's use of its tailbacks as receiving outlets has bailed them out a number of times in key games.

Lastly, there's the question of mental toughness. And things are so very hazy here. Seattle has only came back from a stressful deficit once in the season. That one comeback was later followed one week later by them ceding a lead to an upstart Arizona squad. I'm not sure if there's any other adverse situations for me to seriously consider here. The only other thing that could signify some mental fortitude here is the team's ability to manage penalties. Seattle's been far from egregious in that respect. Still, it's honestly not enough for me to give them any credit here when it comes to mental strength.

So we have a Seattle squad stocked with talent. It's the combination of Russell Wilson trending negatively and the lack of any evidence demonstrating mental toughness that has me a little wary of this team. I would have really liked this team as a dark horse contender, as it stands out, Seattle is just yet another team with considerable talent and not much else.

## Buffalo Bills

***

Buffalo is _probably_ the league's hottest offense, thanks in part to their elite quarterback. Josh Allen is likely to finish the year as the runner-up MVP, something that damn near nobody predicted before the season even started. His renaissance this year came due to two things - an appreciable improvement in his accuracy and Brian Daboll and Sean McDermott working together to install an offense truly catering to Josh Allen's skill set. Buffalo's offense is schematically designed to allow for easy passes over the middle to shifty receivers while keeping open the option for deep lobs to receivers with large catch radiuses. It's a style of football conceived for a passer who won't necessarily awe you with his accuracy, to put it kindly. In that respect, this offense was bound to see a a major boost now that Stefon Diggs was brought into the fold to act as that one dominant wide receiver taking the top off opposing defenses and catching those erratic passes Allen would throw too often in years past. Josh Allen's jump up in accuracy this year was completely unexpected and elevated this offense to a whole another level.

If only Buffalo's defense could match their talent level on offense. Don't get me wrong, their secondary has some solid players, but it's the defensive front that's really missing juice. Not a single lineman nor edge rusher have stood out this season. The raw statistics alone back up that disappointing fact. On top of that, watching tape hasn't really illuminated any elite talent flying under the radar. I see trench players popping up now and then, but never with any sort of consistency.

On a slightly more positive note, the team has some mental fortitude worth noting. Buffalo made two fourth-quarter comebacks against the the Dolphins and the Rams and recovered from a double-digit deficit against the Jets. Now they did cede a fourth-quarter lead last minute against the Cardinals, but that was on a prayer throw. Special teams remains a point of concern given Tyler Bass missed several plausible field goals in the first half of the season.

So with all that said, Buffalo is a true contender for the Super Bowl this year. Vegas seems to recognize that as well, given their championship odds are only +700.

## Indianapolis Colts

***

Indianapolis was such a promising team entering 2020. In recruiting Philip Rivers, the hope was that the Colts had that final piece they so desperately needed to wage a championship run. Unfortunately, Rivers ended up being this team's biggest point of failure. Philip's last couple years was spent aging in dog years, considering his accuracy, decisiveness, and composure all dropped off a cliff. As a result, this offense is nowhere near as productive as I'd expect from a squad coached by Frank Reich.

The team's mental fortitude also needs to be questioned. Sure, the Colts bounced back from double-digit deficits against the Bengals and Packers (both teams featuring productive offenses), but then they went and blew a huge lead just recently against a Steelers team completely missing its mojo on offense. Looking elsewhere, another moment of adversity worth examining is the loss of star tailback Marlon Mack early in the season. It took a bit of time, but the Colts finally developed a suitable replacement in Jonathan Taylor. Consider that a testament to Reich's ability to compensate for critical injuries, something he surely picked up from his time over in Philly.

On defense, the team boasts solid talent at every level. It says something that Indianapolis is generally considered one of the better defenses in the league despite running a pretty simplistic scheme. That being said, the defensive front only harbors one elite player in DeForest Buckner. The stats alone would have been enough to justify his elite designation, but on tape, the man has consistently made impact plays. Justin Houston is another name worth mentioning given his name cache and the fact that by raw stats alone, his numbers bill him as the team's second best pass rusher. That being said, I'm still not sure if he can be included. Has he been able to maintain a high level of play through the season? Not too sure...the limited tape I've reviewed on the Colts doesn't really say much about him. Unless I've only watched his worst games this season, I feel better not registering him as an elite player.

All things said, the Colts are a damn good team, but having an albatross at quarterback and being somewhat short on the requisite amount of talent at certain position groups, a Super Bowl is out of the question. Expect them to give the Bills some hell though.

## Los Angeles Rams

***

Ah, the Rams. Not too long ago, they were the cream of the crop when it came to offensive football. Now...not so much. For one thing, elements of the Shanahan system have been adopted by so many other teams across the league that defenses finally figured out some solutions to counter many of the concepts and tricks it employs. Second (and more important), Jared Goff has a hard time playing a traditional brand of football in which the quarterback is simply expected to drop back, read the field, and make timely throws. Goff never had the type of mentality expected of an elite quarterback. Maybe it's his complete lack of composure under pressure or an inability to read defenses, but Goff can't be counted on to marshal this offense, especially in adverse moments.

And that's the other thing about these Rams - they haven't demonstrated any real mental toughness through the season. Sure, they had one game-winning drive against the Buccaneers in Tampa Bay, but nothing else they've done this season signifies to me that the team can overcome adversity. Trying to win an elimination-style game against a decent Arizona squad in the last week of the regular season could have possibly been a triumphant moment for them given the magnitude of the moment and the fact that Jared Goff wouldn't be playing. But Kyler Murray leaving the game early due to injury effectively put an end to that contest. At that point, it didn't take much for the Rams to coast their way to the postseason.
