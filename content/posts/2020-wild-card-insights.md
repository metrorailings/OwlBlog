## Colts @ Bills

Halfway through the game, it's clear Frank Reich is outcoaching Sean McDermott here. While McDermott is playing the Colts ground game decently, Reich is using the threat of the rushing attack to set up screens and match receivers/tight ends up against undersized defensive backs. Not to mention the sporadic use of hurry-up offense to throw the Bills defense off kilter.

Both teams and their top defensive linemen are showing up prominently in the run game.

Excellent sideline throws by Josh Allen to Gabriel Davis. It's why Josh Allen is an elite quarterback.

Buffalo making serious hay with read-option runs with Josh Allen.

Indianapolis rookies made some silly mistakes, effectively ending a promising Colts drive without posting any points on the scoreboard. Playoff experience matters, folks.

## Ravens @ Titans

Tennessee doing some excellent work with their perimeter defense, stymieing the Ravens and their exotic rushing attack.
