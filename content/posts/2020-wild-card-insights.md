## Colts @ Bills

Halfway through the game, it's clear Frank Reich is outcoaching Sean McDermott here. While McDermott is playing the Colts ground game decently, Reich is using the threat of the rushing attack to set up screens and match receivers/tight ends up against undersized defensive backs. Not to mention the sporadic use of hurry-up offense to throw the Bills defense off kilter.

Both teams and their top defensive linemen are showing up prominently in the run game.

Excellent sideline throws by Josh Allen to Gabriel Davis. It's why Josh Allen is an elite quarterback.

Buffalo making serious hay with read-option runs with Josh Allen.

Indianapolis rookies made some silly mistakes, effectively ending a promising Colts drive without posting any points on the scoreboard. Playoff experience matters, folks.

## Ravens @ Titans

Tennessee doing some excellent work with their perimeter defense, stymieing the Ravens and their exotic rushing attack.

Hollywood Brown doing some great work in the game so far. He's been the focal point of the passing game. He's also contributed on some funky swing routes.

On that note, Mark Andrews has done very little so far.

Baltimore just came back from a double-digit deficit. Impressive. Granted, it's the Titans, but still impressive nonetheless.

Wink Martindale won this game with his defense. Derrick Henry was kept quite the entire game, thanks to him stacking the line of scrimmage with heavy tackles. Normally, the Titans should be able to rely on their receivers, but once Baltimore switched coverage to a mix of zone and man coverage, Tennessee's receivers weren't able to adjust. Normally against zone coverage, an offense should be able to make money with seam throws to tight ends and slot receivers, but I'm not sure if Tennessee ever developed that facet to their offense. Another shocking thing - Tennessee didn't really run Ryan Tannehill much.

It's hard to side with teams in a rematch against opponents they've beaten earlier in the season.

## Browns @ Steelers

Browns have been housing these Steelers since the first quarter. Not sure entirely why. It seems the Browns read the Steelers all too well though. Jarvis Landry motioning around different parts of the formation seem to throw Pittsburgh's defense off its game.

## Buccaneers @ Washington

Washington is pressuring Tom, but it's not enough. Brady is still productive.

Seems like Tampa has way too many weapons for Washington's secondary to cover adequately.  Not that it matters much, because the key to stopping Brady is simple - constant pressure. New Orleans was able to achieve this, but not Washington so far. Maybe the second half will tell a different story...
