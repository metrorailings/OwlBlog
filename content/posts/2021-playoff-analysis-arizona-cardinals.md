The Cardinals are an interesting bunch, to say the least. Their offense is absolutely loaded with talent. Save for an elite quarterback, Arizona's offense would probably be the most complete among all postseason contenders. It also helps coach Kliff has demonstrated considerable competence in his role as the team's chief offensive guru.

The defense introduces our first real concern here. Even though the roster features some solid personnel, Vance Joseph can't be considered a quality defensive coach given all his stumbles this season. His worst showing came recently against a Colts offense missing **_four_** starting offensive linemen. How do you lose convincingly against an Indianapolis outfit missing most of their offensive front? Carson "Ricky Fowler" Wentz arguably had his best game of the season against Vance Joseph's unit. That being said, the fact that the defensive front is loaded with one verifiably elite pass rusher and two other players capable of premiere billing is good news.

The only other issue comes with experience. Kliff Kingsbury's team is a solid team, but a young one. Too many key players among the offense and defense are missing experience in elimination game scenarios. It's going to hurt them in the wild card round for sure.
