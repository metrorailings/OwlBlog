The Cardinals are an interesting bunch, to say the least. Their offense is absolutely loaded with talent. Save for an elite quarterback, Arizona's offense would probably be the most complete among all postseason contenders. It also helps coach Kliff has demonstrated considerable competence in his role as the team's chief offensive guru.

The defense is where things turn concerning. Even though the organization boasts Chandler Jones as an elite quarterback, only one other player holds elite potential along that defensive front. Even worse, Vance Joseph can't be considered a quality defensive coach given all the times he's stumbled this season. His worst showings came in critical losses against the Rams and a Colts franchise missing **_four_** starting offensive linemen. How do you lose convincingly against an Indianapolis outfit missing most of their offensive front? Carson Wentz arguably had his best game of the season against Vance Joseph's unit.
