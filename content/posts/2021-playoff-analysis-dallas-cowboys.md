The Dallas Ladyboys. I love that little nickname for them. It has way more charm than "cOwgiRLs".

As a Giants fan, it pains me to say Dallas is a championship contender. But they have a good number of the ingredients a team needs to be considered a Super Bowl contender. Their defense has two veritably dominant players lining up in the trenches, with a third player potentially qualifying as elite as well. Add on top of that the mind of Dan Quinn, who's clearly evolved this year into one of the game's most capable defensive strategists. Unlike most other postseason teams, the Cowboys have precious little to worry about on defense.

Offense is a bit of a different story, especially lately. To put it succinctly, it's been stuck in a rut. Dak Prescott has been anything but sharp as the team's quarterback. Amari Cooper has lost a step and possibly top billing among that receiving corps. Ezekiel Elliott has been downright pathetic this year, getting outclassed by his understudy in Tony Pollard. Kellen Moore seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle in this downturn too. Outside of a primetime showing against Washington (and gadget plays here and there), his impact hasn't really been felt since the Cowboys stunned the Vikings midway through the season. It's bizarre. He's demonstrated competence early in the season, but lately, it seems as if he hasn't done much to fix an offense losing clarity and purpose. Then again, the problem may be more with Dak Prescott failing to read defenses and cycling through his reads accordingly. We'll know for sure once the playoffs start and their mettle's tested early by a good team.

So here we are, the Dallas Cowboys as a dark horse candidate for the Super Bowl this year. To win the championship though, they'll need to likely survive two contests on the road against quality teams. And that'd be markedly difficult so long as their offense remains dysfunctional.

**Dallas reaches the Super Bowl if**  
their offense shapes up in time for the postseason. I'm not expecting anything elite performances here from that unit, but the offense needs to be consistently proficient if they are to survive two road playoff games.
