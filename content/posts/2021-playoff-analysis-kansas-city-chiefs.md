The Chiefs are an interesting team. Just a week ago, I saw only one star edge rusher. On top of that, the team's surrendered as many comebacks as they've mounted successfully, giving me legitimate cause to question their mental fortitude. But that win against Denver to close out their regular season was critical. Not only did Kansas register another successful comeback, they did so on the road thanks to a brilliant performance from Melvin Ingram. Ingram now merits some serious consideration as an elite pass rusher, something the Chiefs desperately needed if they're to boast a fully loaded defense entering the postseason.

The offense is really the only problem area on this team. Pretty surprising too considering Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid have molded this offense into one of the most explosive units in the league over the past few seasons. But their performance this season has been horribly inconsistent. Nothing better demonstrates this than the Cincinnati game - the Chiefs post four touchdowns in the first half only to lie down and die in the second half.
