Ah, the Raiders...many kudos to them for reaching the playoffs even after all the drama that beset them since Jon Gruden was forced to abruptly resign. Rich Bisacchia has done a yeoman's work here, shepherding this organization through numerous scandals and staging multiple comebacks to take his team into the postseason.

Even though Las Vegas is a last-minute entrant, the reality is that this club has some legitimate talent. It may honestly be one of the only postseason entrants to boast two dominant pass rushers. On top of that, the offense holds serious promise, though injuries and a lack of imaginative coaching may keep them from ever realizing much of that potential. Ever since Henry Ruggs decided to take his talents to prison, the Raiders have been missing that deep threat that lent the offense an air of explosiveness. Zay Jones has come the closest to replacing Ruggs in that aspect, but the eye test tells me Derek Carr has yet to really bond with Jones - I've seen Carr miss Jones on too many open throws to make me question whether Jones can be counted as a reliable route runner.
