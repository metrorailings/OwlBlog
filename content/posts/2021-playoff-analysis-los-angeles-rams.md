The Rams have been notably pathetic finishing out the season. It hasn't been a good winter for them so far, though they've managed to seize the NFC west throne. Things started out so well for them looking as if Matthew Stafford would be the passer Sean McVay so badly needed to open up his offense, but for reasons either related to injury or ineptitude, the Rams offense hasn't really changed its colors much from last year. It shows up in that the team has still yet to develop a full set of playmakers on offense to compliment their shiny new quarterback. Though to be fair, Robert Woods untimely injury midway through the season really seems to have hurt them - Odell Beckham simply hasn't been a suitable fill-in for the role the inveterate Woods played in this McVay offense.
