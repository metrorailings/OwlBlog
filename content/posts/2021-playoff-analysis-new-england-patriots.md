The Patriots have been a fascinating franchise this year. After starting off very slow, New England went on a bit of a rampage against some underwhelming opponents before finally gaining legitimacy by shutting out the Falcons and then stomping all over the Bills in a primetime game. As quickly as they were crowned the league's best team, they fell from grace after statement losses against the Colts and the Bills in a divisional rematch.

A couple things need to be noted here in my limited review of the Patriots. One, their pass rush only has one star - Matthew Judon. It's not necessarily a terrible thing, but championship teams typically have at least two stud pass rushers. Super Bowl teams missing two star pass rushers usually compensate through offense....but that brings me to point number two - their offense is the very definition of a managed offense. Production is generally schemed and Mac Jones is only tasked with keeping the offense on schedule. He's shown some ability to make difficult throws under pressure, but it's all too clear he's a rookie still cutting his teeth at the professional level. When Jones was forced to assume the mantle of production against an emotionally charged Bills team, his throws were low and out of rhythm. Dropback football isn't much of an option for this Patriot team yet, which will effectively dooms them from making much progress in the postseason. Perhaps they can notch a win in the wild card round, but it's hard envisioning them going much further than that.
