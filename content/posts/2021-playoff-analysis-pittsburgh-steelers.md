It's partly a shame that these Steelers managed to slide their way into the playoffs instead of Justin Herbert and his Chargers. No disrespect to Pittsburgh, but their fate is practically sealed given the absolute impotency of their offense. Pittsburgh's offense has become way too damn stale and boring with its religiously fervent dedication to short passes. So much of the blame there can be laid on the shoulders of Ben Roethlisberger, who's probably extended his stay in the league by two to three years. Given his age and his aversion to hits, it's the only type of offense he's capable of running.

That being said, kudos to Mike Tomlin and company for somehow clawing their way into the postseason. It's a feat made all the more remarkable considering the franchise was effectively saddled with a dying horse at quarterback for the whole season. It honestly speaks volumes to their mental fortitude that the club managed to mount six successful comebacks while only surrendering one. And it'll be this toughness that should be tested going into the opening round against Kansas City and their loaded roster.

Could they make some hay in the first round? Sure. I anticipate they'll play the Chiefs tough, especially after being embarrassed against them just a few weeks ago. Mike Tomlin is too good a coach to be embarrassed twice defensively, so expect Pittsburgh to draw upon their coaching acumen as well as their strength of spirit to stay competitive against the Chiefs. It almost certainly won't be enough, but it should keep things interesting.
