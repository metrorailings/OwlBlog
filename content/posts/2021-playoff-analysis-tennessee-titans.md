Tennessee is a promising team, capable of pulling off an upset or two in these playoffs. But the only substantive issue with them is comes with their lack of star pass rushers as well as the number of comebacks they've surrendered.

On that first point, no one player on this Tennessee organization has stood out much in terms of rushing the passer with any real consistency. Harold Landry, Jeffery Simmons, Bud Dupree, and Denico Autry have all had their moments, sure, but I really want to see somebody generate impactful plays on a much more regular basis. In a critical match against the 49ers, I saw Jeffery Simmons show up the most on tape, but he only flashed two or three times. Going forward, I'll need to dedicate more time assessing game tape of their defensive front to truly determine whether any one of their defensive linemen can be considered elite.

Two comebacks surrendered otherwise mar an otherwise impressive record this year of remaining composed in the face of adversity. Four total comebacks were successfully mounted by this Titans franchise. On top of that, the team fought well in select games against perceivably far superior competition, decisively winning those contests from start to finish.

**Tennessee advances far (possibly even to a championship) if**  
a face or two among their defensive front steps up and elevates into elite form. That and key pieces of that offense must remain healthy, especially Tannehill. Ryan's been taking a beating over the better part of the year and the organization doesn't quite have the offensive coaching to compensate if injury forces him out of action.

**Tennessee dips out early if**  
they face a competent offense early that can exploit their lack of any dominant talent along that defensive front. Of course, that means that nobody along their defensive line will round into elite form by the time the playoffs start.
