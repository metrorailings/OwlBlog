With only a few weeks left before playoffs, it's time to start analyzing postseason contenders.

The model I developed last season will be carried over here, with one major change. Not only will overcoming double-digit deficits or staging late-game comebacks be considered in the model, but the reverse will be factored in as well. Any time a team blows a double-digit lead or loses the game late, it'll be counted negatively towards them as a sign of weakness. The more I think about this, the more I think it's fair to factor these type of losses into the model as an indication that an organization is not as mentally tough as one would expect from a team contending for a Super Bowl championship.
