With only a few weeks left before playoffs, it's time to start analyzing postseason contenders.

The model I developed last season will be carried over here, with one major change. Not only will overcoming double-digit deficits or staging late-game comebacks be considered in the model, but the reverse will be factored in as well. Any time a team blows a double-digit lead or loses the game late, it'll be counted negatively towards them as a sign of weakness. The more I think about this, the more I think it's fair to factor these type of losses into the model as an indication that an organization is not as mentally tough as one would expect from a team contending for a Super Bowl championship.

Green Bay will likely be the top seed in the NFC thanks mostly to the leadership and ability of one Aaron Rodgers. Not only is he an elite quarterback, he's the best quarterback in the league, bar none. His impact on the game has never been more appreciable than when the Packers were forced to march into Kansas City with Jordan Love assuming the reins of the offense after Rodgers tested positive for COVID.

I think Green Bay's offense is fine for the most part. It could use one more receiving weapon to compliment Davonte Adams. Randall Cobb may have been supposed to be that final piece to give the Packers a complete trio of talented skill players, but a season-ending injury ended that dream.

The problem with Green Bay is still the same it was last year - its defense. Joe Barry was hired to replace Mike Pettine after a disastrous showing last year against Tampa in the NFC championship. For a few weeks, it seemed like Barry would finally be that beautiful defensive mind the Packers so badly need to help the defense elevate into elite form. The problem is that unit has lost control of opponents multiple times over the past several weeks. Injuries and COVID have nipped away some of their better players, but it's still not enough of an excuse to justify a unit like that falling off a cliff. The Ravens and the Browns should have never been given enough air to try and stage late-game comebacks. I mean...Baltimore was literally fielding their B-team on offense when they started rallying like crazy in the fourth quarter. It was only Harbaugh's reckless decision to attempt the two-point conversion in the end that the Packers were able to escape Maryland with a win. Likewise, Cleveland was trying to drive for the game-winning field goal before Baker ended up throwing his _fourth pick_. Think about that...it took four picks to finally seal the game away. Turnovers are great and all, but a defense cannot just rely on turnovers to close out games, period.
