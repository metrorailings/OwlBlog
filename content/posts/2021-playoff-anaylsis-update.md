So I need to make some updates to some of the grades I gave out to some teams now that wild card weekend is over.

Now that the Bengals have a playoff game under their belt, the lack of postseason experience is no longer a major concern holding them back. Even though it's arguable, I'll award them full credit anyway when it comes to having the requisite postseason experience to succeed.

The Rams definitely deserve a good bit more credit on offense than I originally thought. Tyler Higbee and Odell Beckham were crucial to Los Angeles' win over Arizona. Even though the Cardinals went out of their way to keep Cooper Kupp draped in double coverage, Stafford made some hay throwing the ball to Beckham and Higbee - in fact, their first couple touchdown drives could be attributed to those two serving as reliable outlets in the passing game.

Going into Tampa Bay, Los Angeles now has enough weapons to compensate for Kupp's offense should Todd Bowles elect to snuff out the star receiver with aggressive bracket coverage. It'll be a way more interesting game than I originally thought before the playoffs even began. An upset is very plausible.
