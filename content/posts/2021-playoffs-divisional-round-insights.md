## Bengals @ Titans

Tennessee is just depressing me. Even if they win, it's a horrible win. I need to re-assess the continuity of the offensive line here. It's a line that's really struggling to get any push up front in the running game. Now they have all their starters back, but it hasn't really amounted to much - Cincinnati is winning the battles in the trenches.

Credit to Lou Anaramo. Disguising coverages, lining up heavy along the front...it's clear the defensive coaches behind the Bengals are fully aware Tennessee wants nothing more than to just run the ball. Even though the Bengals are giving up yards in the game, they're not giving up much in terms of success rate, which is what ultimately matters.

So it appears Zac Taylor has adjusted in the second half by opting to run Mixon more, possibly out of heavy formation. Smart adjustment.
