Last weekend was full of ups and downs for me. Saturday was a remarkably bad day for me, starting with the Titans offense choking hard against a young Bengals club I clearly underestimated. The Packers losing to the 49ers wasn't quite as shocking, but the manner in which they lost was...outrageous. In fact, the whole game was a mess with both teams producing dud performances on offense. San Francisco's offense didn't even find the end zone once, but the team still won thanks to an exceptionally strong performance from its defense as well as Green Bay shooting off its toes in the fourth quarter.

Sunday was beautiful though. I nailed both games, though the Chiefs game did give me some IBS towards the end. Kansas coughing up two touchdowns against a guy that hasn't mounted a comeback in more than a year was unsettling. The worst part is that the Chiefs had multiple opportunities to close out drives on fourth down, but they let Josh Allen MacGyver his way toward conversions.

So one thing I learned - I truly undervalued offense. On top of that, I terribly overestimated Tennessee's offensive potential. Todd Downing isn't some ingenuous offensive mind - he's an idiot. Forcing Derrick Henry to tote the rock for much of the game even though D'Onta Foreman was so much more productive in that same role is inadvisable. Not being able to move the ball forward one stinking yard on two successive downs is a fireable offense, period. On top of that, Tannehill just forcing balls late into tight windows ended up giving the Bengals three turnovers. Then again, when your offense isn't adjusting to its strengths and insisting on doubling down on a losing strategy, your offense loses whatever charm and ingenuity powered it through some tough moments. Without a competent ground game and Tannehill not showing any inclination to run the ball, Tennessee's offense was reduced to A.J. Brown (with some dash of Julio Jones). Not good. In that respect, Tennessee may have rolled into the postseason with the worst offense of the 14 playoff teams.
