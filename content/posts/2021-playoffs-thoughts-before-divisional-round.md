I decided to make this post in order to log my thoughts on these division games before they happen. After the weekend ends, I'll be revisiting the words I wrote here to assess my estimations and understanding of all the teams involved in these games.

### Bengals @ Titans

Cincinnati did well to ward off Las Vegas last week when they tried to stage a comeback. But the road for them **has** to end here. It just wouldn't make sense otherwise.

Tennessee has too much raw talent and quality coaching for the Bengals to overcome. Cincinnati's lone advantage here is at quarterback, but that alone can't compensate for all the other cards the Titans hold over them, namely coaching and home field advantage. On top of that, Cincinnati hasn't really proven itself a team capable of comebacks, especially on the road.

I expect the Titans to come firing out of the gates here on top of a wave of emotion. Tennessee should dominate this affair from start to finish.

### 49ers @ Packers

The Packers are on notice after San Francisco surprised folks last week with a decisive win over the Cowboys. And they certainly should be - San Francisco has some fierce potential here given the quality of their coaching as well as the overall talent of their roster.

The problem here is I'm not quite sure the 49ers are talented _enough_ to upset Green Bay over on the frozen tundra in Wisconsin. I mean...San Francisco's front only has one marquis player in Nick Bosa. If Bosa is shut down and nobody else can sustain consistent pressure against Rodgers, their defense will be picked apart - Rodgers is too damn good to not find somebody so long as his offensive line holds opposing pass rushers at bay long enough. To be fair though, San Francisco has a fair number of defensive linemen who can emerge as impact players, so it's not as if the 49ers are hopeless defensively. Still, it won't be easy for any of their linemen to break out against the game's best quarterback.

What's far more concerning is Jimmy Garoppalo. The man has a ceiling, something that was made abundantly clear last week against the Cowboys when he nearly gave the win away in the last third of the game. Garoppalo can manage a few touchdown drives here and there, but enduring success isn't quite his forte, especially given his spotty track record this season staging comebacks. Sure, he waged a few successful road comebacks, but the key word there is "few" - he hasn't done it enough to ward off my lingering doubts about his toughness.

In the end, San Francisco is a live dog when it comes to the spread. When it comes to winning though, give me the elite quarterback playing on his home turf.

### Rams @ Buccaneers

It's weird for me to think of the Rams as a legitimate contender here, but the reality is that Sean McVay and company have gotten the better of Tampa Bay twice now. His secret has always been invoking the hurry-up offense early and often. Tampa Bay has one of the league's most aggressive defenses when it comes to rushing the passer, but that pass rush is neutered if a team opts to sell the pass rush short.

Although now that I'm watching the tape from their last game back in September...I notice Bowles elected to play the Rams much more conservatively in the second half, only sending four men to rush the passer while the rest dropped back into some sort of hybrid zone/man coverage. And it still didn't work - Stafford was given way too much oxygen in the market. Shaquil Barrett in particular really failed to impact the game much. One could argue Jason Pierre-Paul not being present that day really set their pass rush back, but given his limited production this season, that argument doesn't hold much weight.

So if we assume the Rams have proven themselves superior to the Buccaneers regardless of coaching adjustments, how can Tampa Bay win the game? I'm not sure. Los Angeles hasn't really suffered any major setbacks between then and now. Yes, Robert Woods will no longer be there, but it seems the organization has found a suitable replacement in Odell Beckham. On top of that, the pass rush has been upgraded now that Von Miller has joined the roster. Leonard Floyd never really developed into that book-end rusher capable of complimenting Aaron Donald's presence along the middle of the trenches, but Miller has that potential, especially if the coaches can regulate his snap count to keep him fresh. But Tampa on the other hand...their roster has been suffering setback after setback for the better part of the season. Sure, a few players are expected to return _just in time_ for this game, but it's quite possible there'll still be vital players absent on Sunday, namely the offensive line. And for those men that are returning this week, in what shape are they in? Are they fully healthy? Bruce Arians isn't necessarily above forcing roster personnel into action even if they haven't fully recovered from whatever kept them inactive.
