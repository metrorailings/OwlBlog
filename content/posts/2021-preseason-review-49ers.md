**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the only major change comes with the addition of Chris Foerster, a former assistant coach with the Dolphins who was fired after being caught snorting coke on camera. Apparently, the cokehead has some coaching left in him.

On defense, the 49ers lost a few assistants to Cleveland. New faces have been brought in to oversee the secondary and the pass rush.

Was it not for some overly simplistic defensive scheming courtesy of Robert Saleh, the 49ers would be world champions and I'd be $8000 richer. Ah well...

Anyway, here we are with the 49ers going into the season as the reigning champions of the NFC. Yes, the roster certainly deserves some credit for that accomplishment, but let's face it - the team's success is largely owed to Kyle Shanahan. First off, his serious demeanor and business mindset empowered this team with a sense of discipline and focus that was missing for years before his arrival. But more importantly, his offensive system has pulled some great production from some pretty unremarkable players. Neither Jimmy Garoppolo nor his offensive linemen nor any of the three halfbacks on the roster have the individual talent to excel independent of scheme. None of them deserve the type of contracts awarded to elite players in their respective positions. But in Shanahan's system, these players were generally as productive as their elite-level counterparts.

Not the first time something like this has happened under Shanahan - his years with the Falcons led to a Super Bowl berth as well as _Matt Ryan_ being crowned season MVP back in 2016. Let that fact sink in for a minute - _Matt Ryan_ actually won MVP honors one season, thanks to Kyle Shanahan. If that alone isn't testament enough to the Shanahan offense...

Moving on...turnover clearly wasn't any concern for San Francisco this offseason. Most of their coaches and players from last year will be returning. A few key folks were lost though, namely Emmanuel Sanders and DeForest Buckner. However, the team spent some valuable draft capital and made some moves in free agency to try to fill the void those two players left behind, so it's possible (albeit unlikely) neither one of them will be missed much.

Garoppolo won't be successful this season as he was last season. It's not possible - he's too limited to perform well on a year-to-year basis. Regression is inevitable, even with that defense. Arik Armstead had a career year last season after years of mediocrity. One would think a shift back to the norm is in the books for him...but then again, he's been showing steady improvement on an annualized basis, so perhaps this sudden turn upward was natural progression. Either way, the greater point here is that the 49ers will not have that lightning-in-a-bottle season this year. It's simply something that's so rare to see. I do expect another solid year though, and a Super Bowl berth is an outside possibility. An invite to the championship dance is only in the works should the 49ers once again have home field advantage. Not an easy feat at all considering the tough competition in their division.
