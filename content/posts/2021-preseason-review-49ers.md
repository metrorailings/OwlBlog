**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the 49ers promoted Mike McDaniel to coordinator once Mike LaFleur was poached by the Jets. The other major change comes with Rich Scangarello returning to the organization as quarterbacks coach. The old quarterbacks coach was let go to make room for Scangarello.

On defense, DeMeco Ryans now takes up the mantle as coordinator of the unit. Besides that and a few new assistants, the coaching staff on that side of the ball hasn't changed much.

Last year, injuries to critical players crippled this team badly. Jimmy Garoppolo suffered a high ankle sprain early in the year that never really healed during the season. Without Jimmy G at full health, San Francisco was forced to rely on a combination of Nick Mullins and CJ Beathard to carry them through most games. Needless to say, it wasn't pretty.

Things should be better going into this season, if only because it's so unlikely the injury bug surfaces again to ruin the team the way it did last year. On top of that, Garoppolo now has more motivation than ever to play beyond his ceiling given he has a highly-prized prospect sitting behind him in rookie Trey Lance. If Jimmy G goes through a funk at any point during the season, Lance will likely be given time to play and assert himself as the starter. In other words, Garoppolo can't afford bad games - otherwise, it's very probable he becomes the league's highest-paid backup quarterback.

On defense, DeMeco Ryans should introduce some new wrinkles into a unit sporting talent at all its position groups. In the first major press conference he's held, Ryans indicated that he wants this defense to be so much more aggressive. I'm sure the 49er defensive linemen loved hearing that (let alone any other mantra advocating they be given more rope to rush opposing quarterbacks.) So long as Fred Warner remains healthy, the 49ers should have the linebacking talent necessary to give their defensive front the freedom to pursue opposing quarterbacks without having to worry about gap control. On top of that, the defense will be helped tremendously by the return of the two cornerstones to their pass rush, Nick Bosa and Arik Armstead. Season-ending injuries to both players left the unit virtually impotent last year. So long as the injury bug doesn't rear its ugly head again, the 49ers will be returning to their 2019 form soon enough.

San Francisco will probably find their way into the postseason again. But any success beyond that is really dependent on whatever identity the offense assumes under a (possibly) motivated Jimmy G and Trey Lance. Shanahan needs this offense to find its 2019 groove again.
