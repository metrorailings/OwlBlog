**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the team lost their....ahem..."passing game coordinator" to Atlanta. On defense, we do see some turnover now that Sean Desai (last year's safeties coach) was promoted to coordinator after Chuck Pagano retired. The three assistant coaches overseeing the front seven were outright replaced. Maybe Sean felt change was desperately needed after the pass rush underwhelmed (relative to their own expectations)? Maybe those coaches were relics from Pagano's regime? No matter the reason, the Bears now have three new assistants coaching their linebackers and defensive linemen.

Chicago's fortunes largely hinges on these two questions - how long Matt Nagy waits before shelving Andy Dalton in favor of Justin Fields, and whether Fields can adapt Nagy's half-baked offense into something halfway decent. It's that simple. Nothing else really matters much. 

Before going any further, let me mention that defense is a moot point here when discussing Chicago's prospects. Their defense should continue being one of the better defensive outfits in the league, even after losing Kyle Fuller to the Broncos. So long as key starters along the front lines remain healthy and Sean Desai doesn't do anything to kill their mojo, the Bears defense should hold up just fine.

It's the offense that dooms Chicago's championship hopes. First, Matt Nagy is an awful coach. His idiotic habits have been well-documented the past few years. Things aren't likely to change there either, given Nagy seems pretty intent on starting Andy Dalton this season despite Justin Fields presenting so much more upside potential.
