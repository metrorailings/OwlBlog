**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the team lost their....ahem..."passing game coordinator" to Atlanta. On defense, we do see some turnover now that Sean Desai (last year's safeties coach) was promoted to coordinator after Chuck Pagano retired. The three assistant coaches overseeing the front seven were outright replaced. Maybe Sean felt change was desperately needed after the pass rush underwhelmed (relative to their own expectations)? Maybe those coaches were relics from Pagano's regime? No matter the reason, the Bears now have three new assistants coaching their linebackers and defensive linemen.

Chicago's fortunes largely hinges on these two questions - how long Matt Nagy waits before shelving Andy Dalton in favor of Justin Fields, and whether Fields can adapt Nagy's half-baked offense into something halfway decent. It's that simple. Nothing else really matters much. 

Before going any further, let me mention that defense is a moot point here when discussing Chicago's prospects. Their defense should continue being one of the better defensive outfits in the league, even after losing Kyle Fuller to the Broncos. So long as key starters along the front lines remain healthy and Sean Desai doesn't do anything to kill their mojo, the Bears defense should hold up just fine.

It's the offense that dooms Chicago's championship hopes. First, Matt Nagy is an awful coach. His idiotic tendencies have been noted too many times over the past few years. And I doubt Nagy's willing to drop any of his bad habits this year, given he's already committed to Andy Dalton being the starter at quarterback this year. Why would you risk spending so much draft capital signing Justin Fields if you only intend to redshirt him his rookie year? Regardless, it's all but certain Dalton's bound to fail, especially behind Chicago's dismal offensive line. It's only a matter of weeks before Nagy's forced to play Fields. But then Fields would need to find a way to be productive in Nagy's system. It's a pretty grueling ask for a rookie quarterback.
