**COACHING TURNOVER**  
The offensive coaching staff was shaken up quite a bit. Given the sorry state of affairs on offense last year, I imagine this was done to try and breathe life back into that unit.

I don't want to spend too much time on this sad team. Things were a train wreck last year thanks to Mike Brown's and Zac Taylor's abysmal mismanagement of the team. I don't expect things to change much this year, given neither of them seem to have bothered addressing the team's biggest weakness from last season - an absolutely ugly and filthy offensive line. An offensive line that ended up getting its star quarterback killed last year. Joe Burrow is the only glimmer of hope keeping this team interesting, so for Taylor and Brown to jeopardize his health by having him play quarterback behind cardboard cutouts is damn near criminal.

Joe Burrow returning from devastating injury presents an unknown here. Can he play with the same drive and passion from his rookie year? We'll see. I wouldn't blame him at all if he can't find it within himself to play with the same intensity from last year - who'd want to put their battered body back on the line again for such an inept organization? 

The Bengals have literally just enough talent to steal a few wins here and there. Anything more than six wins would shock the hell out of me.
