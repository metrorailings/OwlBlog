So here we are evaluating a Buffalo Bill team with high hopes for the Super Bowl this year. But two things will weigh considerably here when determining their championship prospects - their pass rush and whether Josh Allen can sustain his top-caliber play from last year.

First off, let's discuss their pass rush. Buffalo did _nothing_ in free agency this offseason to improve their pass rush. Instead, they invested their top two draft picks this year into defensive ends. The problem here is that trench players (with the exception of a talented few) need some time to settle into the professional leagues. Don't expect any immediate uptick in pass rushing efficacy here. In fact, I'm doubtful whether these Bills can outperform their dismal pass rush from last year. Mario Addison is past his prime and Jerry Hughes is whittling down with age. Nobody else on the depth chart presents much potential outside of last year's top draft pick, A.J. Epenesa. Even then, his second-round billing precedes him. If these Bills have no pass rush, it's one less key in their favor heading into the postseason.

The other major thing to discuss is Josh Allen. Can Allen relive his phenomenal quarterbacking from last season? It's hard to say. It's mythically rare to see a quarterback improve so dramatically in accuracy _after_ being in the NFL for a few years. When Josh did was a stark statistical anomaly. Normally, these players regress after sensational years, so it would make too much sense for Josh Allen to recede back into his old ways. But then again, all this is assuming Josh Allen's impressive showing was attributable solely to personal improvement. The fact of the matter is that the inclusion of Stefon Diggs played a role in his evolution - Allen never had a deep ball threat like Diggs available at his disposal. Beane and McDermott thought it best to add another weapon into the mix with Emmanuel Sanders. Keep in mind that Sanders is more known for exposing gaps in coverage than catching lobs downfield, but another top-flight weapon could help Allen retain some of his elite form from last season. So it truly remains to be seen whether the Josh Allen we see in the coming weeks will resemble the man with low expectations or the man who was runner-up in MVP voting.

And with that said, we come to our final forecast. Another 13-win season seems out of the question here, in spite the added game. For one thing, defenses are likely to adjust to Buffalo's pass-heavy offense. Second, the Patriots won't be giving them two easy notches in the win column this year. Third, Josh Allen _will_ be going through some regression - even a small bit of regression is enough to cost them a game or two. All that being said, the Bills still remain a Super Bowl contender, albeit a dark horse one. Being short any elite defensive linemen already sets them behind the 8-ball. Buffalo will practically need to be aces in all the other habits a championship team needs to have in order to hoist the Lombardy come February.
