So here we are evaluating a Buffalo Bill team with high hopes for the Super Bowl this year. But two things will weigh considerably here when determining their championship prospects - their pass rush and whether Josh Allen can sustain his top-caliber play from last year.

First off, let's discuss their pass rush. Buffalo did _nothing_ in free agency this offseason to improve their pass rush. Instead, they invested their top two draft picks this year into defensive ends. The problem here is that trench players (with the exception of a talented few) need some time to settle into the professional leagues. Don't expect any immediate uptick in pass rushing efficacy here. In fact, I'm doubtful whether these Bills can outperform their dismal pass rush from last year. Mario Addison is past his prime and Jerry Hughes is whittling down with age. Nobody else on the depth chart presents much potential outside of last year's top draft pick, A.J. Epenesa. Even then, his second-round billing precedes him. If these Bills have no pass rush, it's one less key in their favor heading into the postseason.

The other major thing to discuss is Josh Allen. Can Allen relive his phenomenal quarterbacking from last season? It's hard to say. It's mythically rare to see a quarterback improve so dramatically in accuracy _after_ being in the NFL for a few years. When Josh did was a stark statistical anomaly. Normally, these players regress after sensational years, so it would make too much sense for Josh Allen to recede back into his old ways. But then again, that's assuming Josh Allen's impressive showing was attributable solely to personal improvement.
