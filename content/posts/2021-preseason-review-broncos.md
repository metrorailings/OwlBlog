As I suspected, the Broncos had a down year last season, mostly due to Drew Lock failing to show signs of improvement as a sophomore quarterback. Still...the talent is there in spades. This Bronco defense showed flashes of promise here and there. The head coach and his offensive coordinator have proven themselves before in different settings. Denver honestly has every reason to improve in leaps and bounds this year.

Yet, I can't help but think Vic Fangio's efforts to build a sustainable culture can only bear so much fruit. Maybe I'm overthinking this age disparity between the head coach and his roster, but generational differences are a very real thing impacting organizational unity. It's hard for members of an organization to bond with one another if age renders them personally incompatible. Commanding one of the youngest rosters in the league can't be easy for a man in his sixties. Then again, Fangio is genuinely helped by the fact that head coaches and players have a relationship dynamic that prevents the both of them from getting too close to one another.

Teddy Bridgewater can be that signal caller Denver so hungrily needs though. Drew Lock was such an albatross for this team, costing them several wins. Bridgewater is not an elite talent by any means, but he isn't out there actively losing games. So long as the rest of the team can play above replacement level, Bridgewater can actually lead this organization to a non-losing record. And it'd be a remarkable feat for a head coach so desperately looking for validation.

One more thing worth noting is that new general manager George Paton made a conscientious effort to fortify their defensive backfield. It was needed too, especially given that last year's hyped trade for A.J. Bouye didn't pan out - Fangio himself admitted as such in his comments following Bouye's release. It didn't take long for the Broncos to rebuild their cornerback ranks though - not only was a high first-round draft pick was spent on a corner, the franchise spent considerable cash signing free agents Ronald Darby and Kyle Fuller. With Bryce Callahan returning from injury, Fangio now has a defensive backfield studded with a mix of veteran talent and high-value prospects. Considering Fangio's defenses rely on defensive backs disguising coverage and playing all sorts of tricks, all these moves made to fortify the secondary were necessary.

So long as Bridgewater lives up to expectations, the team can depend on three quality pass rushers to headline their defense, and Mike Munchak can continue doing some good work coaching up that offensive line...Denver can be a sleeper nod for the playoffs this year. Maybe even more than that.
