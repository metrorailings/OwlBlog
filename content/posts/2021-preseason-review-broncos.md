As I suspected, the Broncos had a down year last season, mostly due to Drew Lock failing to show signs of improvement as a sophomore quarterback. Still...the talent is there in spades. This Bronco defense showed flashes of promise here and there. The head coach and his offensive coordinator have proven themselves before in different settings. Denver honestly has every reason to improve in leaps and bounds this year.

Yet, I can't help but think Vic Fangio's efforts to build a sustainable culture can only bear so much fruit. Maybe I'm overthinking this age disparity between the head coach and his roster, but generational differences are a very real thing impacting organizational unity. It's hard for members of an organization to bond with one another if they're personally incompatible. Then again, Fangio is genuinely helped by the fact that head coaches and players have a relationship dynamic that prevents the both of them from getting too close to one another.
