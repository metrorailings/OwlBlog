Cleveland exceeded expectations last year, fighting their way to the division round of the playoffs before losing to the top-seeded Chiefs.

Another postseason trip is very likely this year. Cleveland is just **stacked** offensively - it's almost an embarrassment of riches. Six dependable skill players paired with a solid offensive line gives these Browns so many options on offense. On top of that, Baker Mayfield has adapted remarkably quickly to the Kubiak/Shanahan style of offense Stefansky installed in place. Baker isn't an elite player by any means, but his comfort in Stefansky's system has really elevated this offense to the next level. 

The problem with the Browns is the other side of the ball. The defense isn't quite there. It's lacking talented personnel at all levels, notably along their defensive front. Myles Garrett _desperately_ needs somebody else on the other side of the trenches - no one edge rusher can be an island unto itself. Jadaveon Clowney isn't going to be that complimentary piece either. His tenure in Tennessee ended pretty dismally, as did his tenure in Seattle the year before that. Trends don't lie, so it seems to me Jadaveon's stint in Ohio will end similarly enough. If anything, it was a mistake to let Olivier Vernon go. Injuries have kept him from realizing his full potential, but his ceiling is definitely higher than Clowney's. Either way, the
