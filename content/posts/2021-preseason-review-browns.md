**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Cleveland has become the picture for coaching consistency this season. Not a single coach from last year was lost or let go. All major position coaches have retained their original role from a season ago.

***

Cleveland exceeded expectations last year, fighting their way to the division round of the playoffs before losing to the top-seeded Chiefs.

Another postseason trip is very likely this year. Cleveland is just **stacked** offensively - it's almost an embarrassment of riches. Six quality skill players paired with a solid offensive line gives these Browns so many options on offense. On top of that, Baker Mayfield has adapted remarkably quickly to the Kubiak/Shanahan style of offense that Stefansky installed in place. Baker isn't an elite player by any means, but his comfort in Stefansky's system has really raised his passing game to another level.

The problem with the Browns is the other side of the ball - the defense isn't quite there. It's lacking talented personnel at all levels, notably along their defensive front. Myles Garrett _desperately_ needs somebody else on the other side of the trenches - no one edge rusher can be an island unto itself. Jadaveon Clowney isn't going to be that complimentary piece either. His tenure in Tennessee ended pretty dismally, as did his tenure in Seattle the year before that. Trends don't generally lie, so it seems to me Jadaveon's stint in Ohio will end similarly enough. If anything, it was a mistake cutting Olivier Vernon loose to sign Clowney. Injuries have kept Vernon from realizing his full potential, but his ceiling is definitely higher than Jadaveon's. Either way, the only other decent pass rusher is Sheldon Richardson, but little reason is there to assume he'll elevate his production this season.

Beyond that, I have so little faith in Joe Woods. When Lamar Jackson and the boys from Baltimore managed to drop 40 points against his unit last season, I suspected the man's not as sharp as he thinks he may be. Absolutely no reason is there for your defense to be slapped silly by a half-baked quarterback like Lamar, especially if your organization has legitimate championship aspirations.

Lacking talent and coaching acumen on one side of the ball means the other side of the ball will be responsible for carrying the team. I don't think an offense led by Baker Mayfield can singlehandedly carry this team to the Super Bowl. Are they a Super Bowl prospect? Sure. But I'd consider them long-shots.
