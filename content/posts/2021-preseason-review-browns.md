**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Cleveland has become the picture for coaching consistency this season. Not a single coach from last year was lost or let go. All major position coaches have retained their original role from a season ago.

***

Cleveland exceeded expectations last year, fighting their way to the division round of the playoffs before losing to the top-seeded Chiefs.

Another postseason trip is very likely this year. Cleveland is just **stacked** offensively - it's almost an embarrassment of riches. Six dependable skill players paired with a solid offensive line gives these Browns so many options on offense. And much to my surprise, Baker Mayfield has adapted remarkably quickly to Stefansky's system, a testament to the undeniable truth that Stefanski's philosophy of offense has brought the best out of the young quarterback.
