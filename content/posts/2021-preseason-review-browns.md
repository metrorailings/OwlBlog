**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Cleveland has become the picture for coaching consistency this season. Not a single coach from last year was lost or let go. All major position coaches have retained their original role from a season ago.

***

First thing I notice when studying this team is that the organization committed itself to fixing its offensive line this season. Signing Jack Conklin in free agency and drafting a tackle in the first round were both much-needed investments after last year's disastrous experiment at left tackle.

Second thing I noticed is that Haslem and his inner circle were truly committed to a complete overhaul of management. Only one assistant coach from last year survived the regime change - all other faces along the coaching ranks come into Cleveland as fresh faces. It was a much-needed change too. Freddie Kitchens lacked the organizational and team-building skills a professional head coach needs to win respect and instill a winning culture. Largely because of his deficiencies, his team lacked discipline, unity, attention to detail, and a willingness to change until it was too late. Todd Monken wasn't doing the team many favors too, forcing the offense to adopt too many air raid principles at the expense of playbook creativity and flexibility.

And on that point, the reality is that Baker cannot operate within a conventional spread-style offense. Maybe it's his inability to really see the field past the line of scrimmage, maybe it's his struggles to read defensive formations and anticipate open windows...I'm not sure. But Baker performs much better executing plays thematically designed to keep defenses guessing. Gadget plays, bootlegs, two tight-end sets....those concepts bring the best out of somebody like Mayfield.

In that light, Stefanski is the right man to be coaching the offense. His work last year in Minnesota under Gary Kubiak should serve his new quarterback well - the same philosophy that transformed Kirk Cousins into a serviceable passer should work wonders for Baker a couple years down the line. Not this season though.

This season is a bit of a wash. For one thing, the coronavirus will slow down the organization's transition from the short-lived Kitchens era to the Stefanski era, meaning it'll take a good minute for the new coaches to indoctrinate the roster with their methodologies and philosophies. But perhaps more importantly, Stefanski will need at least a year to cut his teeth as a head coach, what with this stint in Cleveland being his first ever in that capacity. I expect quite a few clock management issues as well as problems dealing with difficult players. Expect the young head coach to make mistakes as he navigates his first year at the coaching helm of the Browns.

Defensively, the team is still a work-in-progress. High-end talent is in short supply, so let's see if Joe Woods can train this defensive unit to be far greater than the sum of its parts.

Expect a much better year for the Brownies though. It's quite possible this team can actually make a real push for the playoffs towards the end of the season.
