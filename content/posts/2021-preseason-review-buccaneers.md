I'd say things panned out pretty well for the Buccaneers last year. It took some time, but Tampa Bay found its bearings just in time for a championship run. Brady was much more an asset to this team than I originally expected.

First off, let me repeat that consistency is king. Retaining coaches and players year over year allows teams to settle into a groove quicker as the season begins (on top of a number of other benefits). The fact that Tampa Bay managed to keep all their coaches and starting players despite having won a Super Bowl is quite impressive. For a team stocked with as much roster talent, it's almost unfair.

Barring catastrophic injuries, Tampa Bay will be in the postseason again. Another Super Bowl berth may even be possible. But a repeat championship? Unlikely. It's incredibly difficult to win two Super Bowls in a row in the NFL. The same drive and energy that propels a team to a championship just isn't there the year after - think of that drive as a fire that burns so brightly that it can only stay stoked for so long.

On top of that, Tom Brady is in his mid-40s. Age is catching up to him, albeit very slowly. What helped Tom last year was that his offensive line kept him protected, surprisingly. It needs to hold up again in the worst way possible if Brady is to survive one more season in decent shape.
