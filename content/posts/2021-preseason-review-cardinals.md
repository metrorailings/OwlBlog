**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, nothing significant has changed. Almost everybody from last year's staff has been retained.

On defense, the only major change comes with the defensive line coach from last year being replaced with Brentson Buckner. Buckner's last stint in Oakland didn't end well, but I do respect his blunt acceptance of his tenure there - he openly admits to getting fired from there. None of that "it wasn't the right fit for me" bullshit.

Arizona surprised me last year. I fully expected Kliff Kingsbury to predicate his entire offense on the air raid philosophy. Instead, Kingsbury took a more balanced approach, opting to employ the ground game on roughly 40% of offensive plays. No doubt elements of the air raid were weaved into the Cardinals playbook, but ultimately, this team's identity on offense resembled a much more traditional spread offense than the air raid.

On paper, the team has to be better this year. A stud receiver in DeAndre Hopkins coming into the picture, some considerable pieces added along that defensive front seven, Kyler Murray maturing into his second year, most of the coaches from last year returning...all these factors usually forecast an improved team. But Kingsbury, Vance Joseph, and their coaching staff still concern me. I'm still not entirely sure what to make of them - I just don't have enough information to properly judge them. That being said, almost all the decisions they've made over the last year sit well with me.

Kyler Murray has lately been seen as a sleeper pick for MVP, precisely because people expect a sophomore explosion from this Cardinals squad. Can the coaches deliver on that hope? We'll see. I'll give Kliff and company the slight benefit of the doubt given the sound decisions they've made over the last year as well as their willingness to adopt a style of football outside their comfort zone.
