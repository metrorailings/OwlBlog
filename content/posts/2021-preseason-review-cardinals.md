**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, we see a bit of reshuffling with the retirement of last year's passing game coordinator in Tom Clements - few of the offensive assistants were replaced with fresh faces.

All defensive coaches from last year have been retained, with no new faces.

Arizona had a strangely disappointing season last year, even though they posted a non-losing record. The Cardinals should have done better, given they finished the first half of the season with five wins. The second half was sadly underwhelming - Arizona only notched three wins, with one of those wins coming on a ridiculously lucky last-minute touchdown against Buffalo.

Something tells me teams around the league have figured out Kyler Murray's weaknesses - namely, his passing game is significantly limited. Being shorter in stature compared to your average quarterback, Kyler has a harder time seeing the middle of the field. Short throws outside the hash marks are his bread and butter, but take them away and Arizona loses so much production in its air game. Now Kingsbury can theoretically compensate by leaning harder on a multi-faceted ground game incorporating Kyler's speed and Kenyan Drake, but then he'd expose his franchise quarterback to more hits. If enough of these hits rack up, Kyler will be inevitably sidelined as the season waxes on. We've seen this happen last year during the final week of the regular season, when Arizona needed just one more win to slide their way into the playoffs as a bottom seed.

It's hard for me to see Arizona overcoming this, especially if Kliff insists on having Kyler pass as often as he did last year. If Murray cannot work past his vision problems, this offense has a low ceiling. It's not like the defense can carry the team singlehandedly either, not so long as Vance Joseph remains the defensive coordinator. I'm not certain why, but the way this defense carries itself under his leadership leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. It's a unit that's really less than the sum of its parts. One piece of good news is that Chandler Jones is returning fully healthy this season, so as long as age doesn't take its toll on him or J.J. Watt just yet, the Cardinals pass rush could be a force to reckon with.

It's not easy projecting this team's potential. It's a franchise not served well by its coaches, to be honest. Neither Kliff Kingsbury nor Vance Joseph bring much to the table when it comes to ideas or vigor. Without any coaching advantage, Arizona becomes a team functioning purely on talent alone. Unfortunately, their roster talent will not be enough to get them anywhere close to the big dance. A postseason invite is a possibility here, but their road ends there.
