**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, we see a bit of reshuffling with the retirement of last year's passing game coordinator in Tom Clements - few of the offensive assistants were replaced with fresh faces.

All defensive coaches from last year have been retained, with no new faces.

Arizona had a strangely disappointing season last year, even though they posted a non-losing record. The Cardinals should have done better, given they finished the first half of the season with five wins. The second half was sadly underwhelming - Arizona only notched three wins, with one of those wins coming on a ridiculously lucky last-minute touchdown against Buffalo.

Something tells me teams around the league have figured out Kyler Murray's weaknesses. To be honest, was it really that difficult to deduce - Kyler's passing game is seriously limited. Being shorter in stature compared to your average quarterback, Kyler has a harder time seeing the middle of the field. Short throws outside the hash marks are his bread and butter, so take those away and Arizona's air game loses so much production.
