## _Tier 1_

***

**QB**  
_Patrick Mahomes_

**KNOWN VECTORS**  
_Patrick Mahomes (Mobile QB), Tyreek Hill (WR), Travis Kelce (TE), Clyde Edwards-Helaire (RB)_

**NOTABLE DEFENSIVE PLAYERS**  
_Chris Jones (DT), Tyrann Matthieu (SS)_

**MANAGERS**  
_Brett Veach (GM), Andy Reid (HC), Eric Bieniemy (OC), Steve Spagnuolu (DC)_

**VEGAS OVER/UNDER**  
12 to 12.5

**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Not much turnover here, as expected for a team that recently won a championship without losing any of its major coaches. Outside of a few assistant coaches, the whole staff's returned from last year. Particular noteworthy - Britt Reid is no longer with the team now that his future as a free man is tenuous given his role in an ugly car crash after a hard night of drinking. Taking over as linebackers coach is Ken Flajole.
