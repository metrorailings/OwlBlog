**VEGAS OVER/UNDER**  
12 to 12.5

**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Not much turnover here, as expected for a team that recently won a championship without losing any of its major coaches. Outside of a few assistant coaches, the whole staff's returned from last year. Particular noteworthy - Britt Reid is no longer with the team now that his future as a free man is tenuous given his role in an ugly car crash after a hard night of drinking. Taking over as linebackers coach is Ken Flajole.

Kansas City nearly managed to repeat as Super Bowl champions, thanks largely to some sensational quarterbacking from Patrick Mahomes. But in the championship, things fell apart when Tampa Bay's defense was able to harass Mahomes on nearly every passing down. Relying on second-string tackles to protect the young man was clearly a mistake, but injuries aside, it just seems that the Chiefs were caught flat-footed against a well-prepared Tampa defense. Despite building a reputation for the blitz, Tampa refused to send more than four pass rushers on the vast majority of snaps. Instead, the Buccaneers were all too content playing a base zone defense against the Kansas and their dynamic weapons.
