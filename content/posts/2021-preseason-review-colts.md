**STAFF TURNOVER**  
The Colts lost Nick Sirianni over to the Eagles. Not much of a big loss though - head coach Frank Reich is the architect of this offense.

I overestimated Philip Rivers in the worst way last year. I thought he'd be baseline competent. Nope, not even close. Rivers was an albatross, a slab of rotting flesh hanging around this team's neck, constricting its potential. Despite that though, the Colts still made the playoffs and fought well in a losing effort against an elite Buffalo team.

Now in Rivers place is a withered Carson Wentz. Can Reich rehabilitate the young man he once led on a very promising MVP campaign? I'm not sure. I want to believe...but his faith in Philip Rivers last year has me questioning whether he's a great judge of worn-down quarterbacks.
