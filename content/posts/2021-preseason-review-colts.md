**STAFF TURNOVER**  
The Colts lost offensive coordinator Nick Sirianni over to the Eagles. Not much of a big loss though - head coach Frank Reich was always the architect of this offense. Still, we do see some shuffling along the coaching ranks as a result of Marcus Brady being promoted to Sirianni's old role. Some assistant offensive coaches from last year have been replaced or reassigned elsewhere.

I overestimated Philip Rivers in the worst way last year. I thought he'd be baseline competent. Nope, not even close. Rivers was an albatross, a slab of rotting flesh hanging around this team's neck, constricting its potential. Despite that though, the Colts still made the playoffs and fought well in a losing effort against an elite Buffalo outfit.

Now taking Rivers place this season is a withered Carson Wentz. Can Reich rehabilitate the young man he once led on a very promising MVP campaign? I'm not sure. I _want_ to believe...but his faith in Philip Rivers last year has me questioning whether he's a great judge of worn-down quarterbacks.

Furthermore, their defensive line needs some help. After DeForest Buckner, the team doesn't really have anybody else they can hang their hat on. Their first two draft picks this year were spent on defensive linemen, but players on that side of the ball usually need a few years to fully develop. So it's a decent bet not to expect any major contributions from the rookies. Back in 2020, Denico Autry may have been the closest thing this team had to a top-level edge rusher opposite Buckner, but he's gone now.

Just based on the strength of their coaching staff and their offensive weaponry, I expect the Colts are due for another playoff berth this year. Can they go far? Well, that'll depend on Wentz. Indy making a Super Bowl appearance this year isn't as far-fetched as it sounds, but Wentz needs to shape up.
