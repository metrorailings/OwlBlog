**COACHING TURNOVER**

***

How did I screw the pooch so badly last year when I was forecasting this team? One thing's clear - Mike McCarthy cannot coach. For one thing, it's become alarmingly clear he has so little input over the direction of the defense. To be fair, that's not always a bad thing when you have somebody capable overseeing that unit as coordinator. Mike Nolan isn't that special somebody you want having unilateral control over your defense. Nolan was simply awful - not only was his unit routinely underprepared, but it looked like his men weren't even playing with much heart. So many Cowboy defenders were caught on tape visibly giving up on plays. Whatever morale the team may have had at the beginning of the season quickly dissipated once Dak suffered a season-ending injury. 

Will things be different this season?
