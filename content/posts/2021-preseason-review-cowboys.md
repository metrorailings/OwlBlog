**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Every offensive coach from last year kept his job, despite the offense being hot garbage for much of the season. I suppose Jerry took some pity on them given Dak's injury essentially left the team crippled.

On defense, Dan Quinn has been hired as the new coordinator replacing Mike Nolan. Oddly enough, some of Nolan's assistants have been retained by the organization. I'm not sure if that was Quinn's doing or the Jones family once again arranging marriages regardless of compatability

How did I screw the pooch so badly last year when I was forecasting this team? One thing's clear - Mike McCarthy cannot coach. For one thing, it's become alarmingly clear he has so little input over the direction of the defense. To be fair, that's not always a bad thing when you have somebody capable overseeing that unit as coordinator. Mike Nolan isn't that special somebody you want having unilateral control over your defense. Nolan was simply awful - not only was his unit routinely underprepared, but it looked like his men weren't even playing with much heart. So many Cowboy defenders were caught on tape visibly giving up on plays. Whatever morale the team may have had at the beginning of the season quickly dissipated once Dak suffered a season-ending injury. 

Will things be different this season? Well, let's see, their defensive coordinator is....oh lord...Dan Quinn. Not good.

It's worth noting Atlanta's defense last year was decisively better **after** Quinn was fired. People were rightfully questioning whether Quinn's presence was doing more harm than good for the Falcons. It's been alleged that Quinn hasn't really adapted his base style of defense to today's NFL. The Cover-3 mode of defense may have been all the rage back in the early 2010s, but in 2021, that mode of defense hasn't seen much success. Even its biggest evangelist in Pete Carroll is struggling over in Seattle. Regardless, Quinn has a glorious ace card in his favor here - Mike Nolan set the bar so abysmally low that it's damn near impossible for this defense not to bounce back. You could have hired a bag of sand as the defensive coordinator and the defense would still improve, if only because the law of regression would prohibit this defense from playing like wet dung two years in a row.

Still, it's hard for me to see this defense bounce back to something approaching average. The reality is that Dallas doesn't have enough horses on that side of the ball. In the trenches, nobody else is there to compliment DeMarcus Lawrence. The secondary's even worse considering not a single defensive back can be considered a top-shelf player - Keanu Neal (an Atlanta transplant) may be the best of the bunch back there.

The offense will see far better days so long as Dak can stay healthy. But so long as the defense and the coaching remain train wrecks, the Cowboys can only achieve so much this season. To me, it's a sure bet that these Cowboys won't be winning more than 9 games this season.
