**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Even though Chan Gailey retired, most of his assistant coaches have been retained, with two of them collaborating as joint coordinators following his retirement. The only major new addition is Charlie Frye as quarterbacks coach. Pretty noteworthy too considering he has some history with Tua.

The same can be said of the defensive staff as well, though instead of an addition, we have some reshuffling going on now that defensive line coach Marion Hobby was let go.

Good to see these Dolphins keeping their coaching staff intact over the offseason. Also lovely to know that the organization is trying to breathe more life back into the offense by supplying it with more weaponry. None of these actions resolve the single biggest issue plaguing this team - Tua Tagavailoa.
