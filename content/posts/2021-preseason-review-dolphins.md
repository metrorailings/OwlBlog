**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Even though Chan Gailey retired, most of his assistant coaches have been retained, with two of them collaborating as joint coordinators following his retirement. The only major new addition is Charlie Frye as quarterbacks coach. Pretty noteworthy too considering he has some history with Tua.

The same can be said of the defensive staff as well, though instead of an addition, we have some reshuffling going on now that defensive line coach Marion Hobby was let go.

Good to see these Dolphins commit to keeping their coaching staff intact over the offseason. Also lovely to know that the organization is trying to breathe more life back into the offense by supplying it with more weaponry. But neither of these acts resolve the single biggest issue plaguing this team - Tua Tagavailoa. Simply put, I believe Tua's a failed venture. His quarterbacking last year gives me no confidence whatsoever. For a young passer to progress upward from year one to year two, he needs to show _something_ in his rookie year...but Tua's shown nothing. His most noteworthy moments came when he was benched not once, but **twice** (in two separate games). Miami hasn't quite given up on the Alabama product yet, but it's hard to blame them for their baseless optimism - it's not easy conceding defeat on a player you invested so much in emotionally and materially.

Once the quarterback becomes problematic, a team needs some quality coaching as well as an array of talented skill players to overcome such a liability. Not sure if Miami has either though...if anything, splitting offensive coordinator duties across multiple coaches worries me even more. History tells me that leadership through collaboration doesn't sit right with me.
