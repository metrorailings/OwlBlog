**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Even though Chan Gailey retired, most of the offensive coaching staff has returned. The only major new addition is Charlie Frye as quarterbacks coach. Pretty noteworthy too considering he has some history with Tua. 

The same can be said of the defensive staff as well, though instead of an addition, we have some reshuffling going on now that defensive line coach Marion Hobby was let go.

Good to see these Dolphins keep their coaching staff intact over the offseason.
