**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Even though Chan Gailey retired, most of his assistant coaches have been retained, with two of them now collaborating in a joint coordinator role. The only major new addition is Charlie Frye as quarterbacks coach. Pretty noteworthy too considering he has some history with Tua.

The same can be said of the defensive staff as well, though instead of an addition, we have some reshuffling now that defensive line coach Marion Hobby was let go.

Good to see these Dolphins commit to keeping their coaching staff intact over the offseason. Also lovely to know see the organization try to reinvigorate its offense by supplying it with more weaponry. But neither of those things resolve the single biggest issue plaguing this team - Tua Tagovailoa. Simply put, Tua's probably a failed venture. His quarterbacking last year gives me no confidence whatsoever. For a young passer to grow from year one to year two, he needs to show me _something_ in his rookie year...but Tua's demonstrated nothing worthy of note so far. His most memorable moments came when he was benched not once, but **twice** (in separate games). Miami hasn't quite given up on the Alabama product yet, which isn't all that surprising - it's not easy conceding defeat on a player you invested so much in emotionally and materially.

Once a quarterback becomes a liability, a team needs some quality coaching as well as an array of talented skill players to overcome such a major deficit. But I'm not sure about the coaching - splitting offensive coordinator duties across two coaches isn't exactly a move filling me with much confidence. History tells me leadership through collaboration usually ends up as a failed experiment. If that trend holds and Tua expectedly fails to deliver on his promise, Miami's offense is going to find itself in dismal straits yet again.

On the flip side, their situation on defense isn't so bad - Miami built up its record last year thanks in large part to their defense, led by the likes of Emmanuel Ogbah and Xavien Howard. But willingly trading away Shaq Lawson for a run-stopping linebacker was a poor decision. It's hard for me to believe the organization is really convinced their pass rush can survive without one of its better players. Likewise, their defensive backfield still remains troubling given that Byron Jones hasn't lived up to his billing.

How did this team rack up 10 wins last year? Some of it could have been fluky, sure, but Ryan Fitzpatrick and his charismatic presence certainly helped. Not to mention Brian Flores has given this team a right mindset by fostering a culture based mainly on meritocracy. That's why Miami isn't quite a dumpster fire despite the woeful nature of their offense. I'm not expecting a bottom-feeding year here, but I am expecting a year of highs and lows filled with ruts.
