**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Despite a new offensive-minded head coach, things weren't completely shaken up on the offensive coaching staff - the wide receivers coach and offensive line coaches from last year were retained. Most importantly though, the staff isn't anywhere nearly as bloated as it was last year.

On defense, we see complete turnover. Every defensive coach from last year has been replaced. And just like on offense, the staff has been sized down from last year.

Last season showed us once again that Philadelphia was a stunning example of injuries crippling the team in so many areas. It seems like every position group sustained injuries to key members.
