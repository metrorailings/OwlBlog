**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Despite a new offensive-minded head coach, things weren't completely shaken up on the offensive coaching staff - the wide receivers coach and offensive line coaches from last year were retained. Most importantly though, the staff isn't anywhere nearly as bloated as it was last year.

On defense, we see complete turnover. Every defensive coach from last year has been replaced. And just like on offense, the staff has been sized down from last year.

Last season showed us once again that Philadelphia was a stunning example of injuries crippling the team in so many areas. It seems like every position group sustained injuries to critical players - the offense in particular found itself beset by the injury bug. But even worse than a plague of injuries, Doug Pederson couldn't field an offense worth a damn. His commitment to the air game reeked of bull-headed arrogance. To commit to passing the ball when the team had no viable wide receiving threat was silly enough as is, but to still insist on throwing the ball around when it was **_so_** evident that the offense was far more productive rushing the ball with Miles Sanders...now that's just hubris. The whole strategy smacked of foolishness. Add on top of that the fact that Pederson flooded his staff with more personnel than any other team and it was all too clear Philadelphia was missing some serious mojo on offense.

That can change this year. A new regime can provide that motivational force this team needs to break out of its rut. Nick Sirianni carries some promise, given he comes from the Frank Reich school of football. His youth and inexperience concern me a bit, but young coaches have been succeeding lately in the NFL, so Sirianni could settle into his new role quicker than expected. On top of that, Reich's experience with the Eagles roster will serve the new coach well as he develops an offense that best takes advantage of Philadelphia's strengths.
