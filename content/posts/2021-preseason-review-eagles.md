**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Despite a new offensive-minded head coach, things weren't completely shaken up on the offensive coaching staff - the wide receivers coach and offensive line coaches from last year were retained. Most importantly though, the staff isn't anywhere nearly as bloated as it was last year.

On defense, we see complete turnover. Every defensive coach from last year has been replaced. And just like on offense, the staff has been sized down from last year.

Last season showed us once again that Philadelphia was a stunning example of injuries crippling the team in so many areas. It seems like every position group sustained injuries to critical players - the offense in particular found itself beset by the injury bug. But even worse than a plague of injuries, Doug Pederson couldn't field an offense worth a damn. His commitment to the air game reeked of bull-headed arrogance. To insist to passing the ball when the team had no viable wide receiving threat was silly enough as is, but to doggedly throw the ball around so much when it was **_very_** evident that the offense was far more productive rushing the ball with Miles Sanders...that's hubris. Doug's whole philosophy smacked of foolishness. Add on top of that the fact that he flooded his staff with more personnel than any other team and it was all too clear Pederson lacked any real mojo on offense.

That can change this year. A new regime can provide that motivational force this team needs to break out of its rut. Nick Sirianni carries some promise, given he comes from the Frank Reich school of football. His youth and inexperience concern me a bit, but young coaches have been succeeding lately in the NFL - Sirianni might be able to follow suit as well. On top of that, Reich's experience with the Eagles roster gives Sirianni some valuable inside information that should serve him well as he formulates a playbook best able to leverage Philadelphia's strengths.

Not too surprisingly though, It still remains very uncertain what this new offense will look like, especially with a sophomore quarterback making his debut as the face of the team. Jalen Hurts has some upside, but much like Lamar Jackson and Kyler Murray, his mobility may have actually limited his development as a pocket passer. It remains to be seen whether Hurts can grasp all the different concepts and schemes he'll need to learn to become a productive passer - his mobile talents will only take him so far in a league where defenders love to tee off on opposing quarterbacks. That being said, Hurts is young enough to be molded, especially from a coach that understands the game. So the Eagles success this year mostly hinges on the coaches, particularly the head coach and the defensive coordinator.

And it's time I move this discussion over to the defensive side of things. Philadelphia was never lacking on that side of the ball, but things will change as the entire coaching staff has been upended this year under Sirianni. Jonathan Gannon comes into the fold here as a coach experienced in training up defensive backs. Not much of a known commodity to be honest, and it seems his hiring was more a result of having worked with Sirianni in Indianapolis than it was actual meritocracy.
