**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Outside of wide receivers coach Dave Brock, nobody survived the coaching transition from last year. Arthur Smith's coaching staff will be spending their first year together acclimating themselves to the organization.

So I was mostly correct in my assessment of the Falcons last year, though they've failed even more spectacularly than I could have seen. Kudos to Arthur Smith for finally accepting the inevitable and tearing everything down in favor of a complete rebuild.
