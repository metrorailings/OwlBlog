So I was mostly correct in my assessment of the Falcons last year, though they've failed even more spectacularly than I could have foreseen. Kudos to Arthur Blank for finally accepting the inevitable and tearing everything down in favor of a complete rebuild.

Rebuilds take time however. And it seems like Atlanta is more than willing to wait. Nothing extraordinary should be expected from this franchise this year. Matt Ryan is a quarterback trending down as he approaches the tail end of his career. Julio Jones has been shipped off to Tennessee, meaning Calvin Ridley now stands as the only definitive weapon among the organization's wide receiving corps. No major moves were made in free agency to bolster any one of the position groups. Dante Fowler is still gainfully employed by this team for reasons beyond human understanding.

Still, I don't expect the team to be hapless either in the upcoming games. For one thing, Matt Ryan has flourished before when under the tutelage of a sharp offensive mind, a mold Arthur Smith definitely fits. On top of that, Kyle Pitts and Haydon Hurst combined gives Atlanta one of the league's best tight-end units. Smith notably made a living in Tennessee off heavy tight-end sets, so expect much of the same here. Despite the team lacking so much raw talent, Dean Pees has demonstrated an ability to spin forth a defense far greater than the sum of its parts. All that said, Atlanta is going to be a consistent underdog this year who'll celebrate upsets here and there. Anything more than that is not feasible.
