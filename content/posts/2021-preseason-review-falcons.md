Outside of wide receivers coach Dave Brock, nobody survived the coaching transition from last year. Arthur Smith's coaching staff will be spending their first year together acclimating themselves to the organization.

So I was mostly correct in my assessment of the Falcons last year, though they've failed even more spectacularly than I could have seen. Kudos to Arthur Smith for finally accepting the inevitable and tearing everything down in favor of a complete rebuild.

Rebuilds take time however. And it seems like Atlanta is more than willing to wait. Nothing extraordinary should be expected from this franchise this year. Matt Ryan is a quarterback trending down as he approaches the tail end of his career. Julio Jones has been shipped off to Tennessee, meaning Calvin Ridley now stands as the only definitive weapon among the wide receiver corps.
