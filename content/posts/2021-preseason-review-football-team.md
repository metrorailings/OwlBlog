Washington may have won the division last year with a losing record, but it's not as if the team was undeserving. Winning seven games despite being weighed down by Dwayne Haskins and Alex Smith was no easy feat, but Ron Rivera and his personnel pulled it off. Chase Young, Montez Sweat, and Jonathan Allen were all key components of a defensive line that won so many of its battles in its trenches. So much of their defensive success was built off the backs of those three men, so it's good to see all three return this year. On top of that, Ronald Darby and William Jackson anchor a secondary that should be able to hold its own in pass coverage.

The offense should be so much better now that Ryan Fitzpatrick and Taylor Heinecke will be its primary signal callers. Unlike their crummy counterparts from last year, Fitzy and Heinecke can chuck the ball all over the field and liven the team's spirits with their toughness. Add Curtis Samuel to a young receiver corps headlined by Terry McLaurin and Cam Sims and the organization has the makings of a potentially dynamic offense. Don't expect anything explosive here, but expect an offensive unit that's heads and shoulders above its counterpart from last season.

It's honestly hard to denounce this team's prospects. Typically, NFC East champions don't repeat year-to-year, but this team is built to win. In fact...given the dominance of their defensive line, the expected improvements on offense, and the consistency of their coaching staff going into this season, I feel safe billing the Football Team as dark horse contenders for the Super Bowl. If Ron Rivera and his quarterbacks manage to foster a culture based on resilience and a drive to win, Washington's championship prospects look so sweet, so long as they survive a fairly daunting schedule.
