**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Everybody on the offensive coaching staff last year will be returning except for the offensive line coach. Given that the offensive line was probably the weakest position group on offense, it makes sense that the Giants brought in a fresh face to train them up. Hopefully, the change pays off.

On defense, no substantial changes were made.

The Giants fared much better last year than I originally predicted. Joe Judge and Patrick Graham impressed me, posting all those wins despite Daniel Jones, Evan Engram, and Colt McCoy doing their best to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.
