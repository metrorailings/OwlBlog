**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Everybody on the offensive coaching staff last year will be returning except for the offensive line coach. Given that the offensive line was probably the weakest position group on offense, it makes sense that the Giants brought in a fresh face to train them up. Hopefully, the change pays off.

On defense, no substantial changes were made.

The Giants fared much better last year than I originally predicted. Joe Judge and Patrick Graham impressed me, logging several wins despite Daniel Jones, Evan Engram, and Colt McCoy doing their best to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

That being said, it was still another lost season ultimately. New York posted a losing record, mostly because Jason Garrett, Daniel Jones, and the offensive line couldn't perform with any real consistency. Periods of brilliant play were usually followed by bouts of incompetency. Jason Garrett in particular was really depressing to watch. Maybe he had to scale back his ambitions to cope with Daniel Jones and his flaws...but his schemes just lacked any imagination or juice - his brand of football was pathetically plain, to be honest. This was all too evident in the first game of the regular season last year, when Saquon Barkley was limited to 6 yards on 15 rushes. New York is too talented on offense not to be consistently productive. Even though Daniel Jones will have his idiotic moments, the Giants have too many weapons on offense to not be making hay. Maybe injuries to Saquon and Daniel Jones really threw their plan off last year, but that doesn't matter now - Jason Garrett needs to demonstrate to me that he can marshal a competent offense. His past history tragically tells me otherwise.

Focusing back on Daniel Jones for a minute, this is his make-or-break year. Jones was drafted by the Giants likely because of his physical similarities to Eli. I'll be honest, I want this boy to succeed simple because of that alone. But he needs to stop with the turnovers. All those fumbles and careless decisions leading to interceptions are really killing any mojo the franchise is trying to whip up on offense. Even though Eli was all too prone to throwing interceptions, he kept the ball secure whenever he was sacked. If Jones can't even do that, it may be time to concede his tenure with the organization as a failed venture.

Defensively, Patrick Graham has done some fantastic work training a unit far greater than the sum of its parts. New York's defense was so good that it was able to compensate for the pathetic offense. In fact, the defense won a few games singlehandedly last year, the most notable victory coming against the Seahawks. That being said, I am concerned about the team still not having a viable pass rush outside Leonard Williams. Williams is a beast in his own right, but nobody else on this team can compliment him. The Giants signed Ifeadi Odenigbo in the offseason, but Odenigbo has yet to prove himself - his numbers in his past stint in Minnesota have been pedestrian. Here's hoping somebody else comes along this season to give New York the one-two punch needed for a legitimate pass rush.

Overall, the Giants success this season hinges on three things happening - Daniel Jones stepping up, Jason Garrett actually adding some color to his playbook, and the offensive line finally showing some mettle. If all three of those things are actualized, expect Big Blue to be a surprise contender in the playoffs.
