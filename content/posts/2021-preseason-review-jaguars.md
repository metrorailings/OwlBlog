**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Obviously, the biggest change at offense comes at the coordinator position. With the sun setting on the Nick Foles era in Jacksonville, John DeFillippo has been let go in favor of Washington's former head coach Jay Gruden. Interestingly enough, the vast majority of offensive assistant coaches from last year have been held over during this transition. Only last year's quarterbacks coach Scott Milanovich managed to bail after securing a head coaching position in the Canadian Football League, so he's been replaced with Ben McAdoo, arguably the worst coach in Giants history.

On defense, the only significant change came with the team replacing the junior linebackers coach.

Are the Jaguars tanking for Trevor Lawrence? Good question. It's hard to argue that Jacksonville's not in a rebuilding mode. I mean...four of their best defensive players have been traded away for draft picks. Nick Foles has been unceremoniously shipped off after the Jaguars shelled out some serious coin for him just a year before. The team's perfectly content keeping sixth-round sophomore player Gardner Minshew in place as the starting quarterback and giving him little in terms of weaponry. The team restrained itself from indulging too much in free agency, only spending serious money to ink Joe Schobert to a contract. Clearly, these moves suggest the organization is embarking on some sort of multi-year developmental plan here.

Unfortunately, that doesn't bode well for the team going into this season. 2020 will be a lost season for the Jaguars. Perhaps the only major thing to look forward to here is whether Gardner Minshew can grow and actually become a decent quarterback going forward. If Minshew does develop into a franchise-caliber quarterback, David Caldwell can consider himself one of the luckiest sons of bitches out there.

In the end, there's not much to expect here. Maybe Jacksonville can beat their expected win total this season, but don't expect anything serious from them. A high draft pick is in the cards for them.
