This year will be interesting for the Jaguars. Through some good fortune, Jacksonville was able to secure the top draft pick and used that position to draft Trevor Lawrence, the most promising quarterback prospect from this year's draft. On top of that, Jacksonville signed Urban Meyer into the organization as its new head coach and standard bearer for the franchise.

And that's what makes it so difficult to forecast Jacksonville's record this season - Urban Meyer is a major unknown factor here. His reputation as a brilliant college coach long precedes him, but his decisions this year have been somewhat concerning. Hiring an accused racist as strength coach isn't a good way to install a culture based on respect. On top of that, signing Tim Tebow as a tight end is just...bizarre? Tebow's athletic, but his NFL career is almost entirely limited to playing quarterback. Not to mention the man's been out of football for several years, which raises concerns about whether he's physically capable of playing the sport at the highest levels while learning the nuances of a position outside his wheelhouse.

I wonder if Meyer's too caught up in his own press clippings to see that some of his decisions may be jeopardizing team culture. Jacksonville's players can only tolerate so many bad decisions before questions start to arise about whether Meyer is fit to coach in the NFL. I know Meyer is coming into the league boasting a championship pedigree, but all those championships were won in collegiate settings, where coaches are held to distinctly different standards of conduct. Coaching styles in college environments don't really translate well to the national level. Now that doesn't mean Urban Meyer will not eventually adjust - it's entirely possible he'll correct any lingering bad habits as the season progresses, but it's something that can't really be foreseen in advance.

That being said, it'll be exciting to watch a team led by a generational quarterback and a legendary college coach. I expect an up-and-down season, consistent with a team still finding its bearings after undergoing so much turnover in the offseason.
