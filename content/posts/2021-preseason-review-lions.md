**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, we see an overhaul. Aside from a few position coaches, everybody on the offensive staff is completely new.

Defense is a complete teardown and rebuild. Nobody on last year's staff survived the regime change.

***

Detroit tore the whole house down after the Matt Patricia era ended in spectacular failure. General manager Bob Quinn has been replaced with an odd two-man tandem of Brad Holmes and Chris Spielman. Head coach Matty boy has been replaced with the charismatic (albeit slightly insane) Dan Campbell, who'll be marking his first year as an NFL head coach. Offensive coordinator and interim head coach Darrell Bevell has been replaced with another former head coach in Anthony Lynn. The entire defensive coaching staff from last year has been replaced with a whole bunch of new faces. Perhaps biggest of all, quarterback Matthew Stafford has been replaced with the disgraced _Jared Goff_.

Welcome your 2021 Detroit Lions, a collection of new bodies and pedestrian talent meshed together to form something resembling a football team.  Judging by the number of games the oddsmakers expect them to win this year, things aren't expected to go well here (to put it nicely). A slow start is virtually certain as personnel will need a few games just to familiarize themselves with one another. Furthermore, Goff isn't exactly the type of player to be lighting fires or inspiring his teammates. In fact, Goff's history suggests he may have some rough moments trying to handle the colder weather up in Detroit as the season progresses. Making matters worse, the team will be missing the services of its three most productive wide receivers from last year. To be fair, their offense isn't completely bereft of talent...but Goff needs **waaaay** more than T.J. Hockenson and D'Andre Swift if he's honestly expected to keep this offense humming.

In all honesty, Detroit's starting a rebuilding project that's expected to take a few years. Expectations were always meant to be set as low as possible. But who knows, maybe the Lions can show some promise sporadically throughout the season. That being said, let's not kid ourselves - a high draft pick is all but assured. Next year will be way more interesting for this team.
