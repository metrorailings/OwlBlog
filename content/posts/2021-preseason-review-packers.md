**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the only significant change was a new coach being hired this year to oversee wide receivers after last year's coach was fired for training a sorry bunch of receivers outside of Davante Adams.

On defense, an assistant coach from Minnesota's staff has been poached to come in and mentor the secondary.

It's a little odd, but it seems that the Packers are ready to move on from Aaron Rodgers. Drafting Jordan Love wasn't simply an impulsive move - general manager Gutekunst and head coach LaFleur see Love as somebody that fits the mold of their offense better. Rodgers on the other hand is way too opinionated and prone to rogue decisions, not the type of man the managers want calling their offense.

But even then, Rodgers is only one part of the problem. The bigger issue here is their uninspiring offense - it's predicated on some pedestrian zone-running concepts. The playbook assumes Green Bay has more than sufficient talent at all levels of their offense to make up for its utter lack of creativity.  But as we saw last year with the wide receivers, that assumption is plainly false.

Likewise, the defense is missing some horses along its ranks too. While their front is loaded with quality talent, the linebackers and secondary players behind them aren't holding up their end of the bargain. Part of that can be attributed to the coaching though - it seems Mike Pettine doesn't mind shortchanging his linebackers to field even more defensive backs. Theoretically, it works well against pass-heavy teams, but it can also be gashed by a team with a strong rushing attack, say like the San Francisco 49ers of last year. Their defensive DVOA numbers from last year illustrate this split pretty well.

Aside from a few new assistant coaches and the addition of Devin Funchess, the Packers organization haven't done much to remediate the problems plaguing them last year. The sportsbooks seem to feel the same way too, pegging their win total pretty low compared to the actual number of wins the team notched last year. Sharper minds are expecting a major regression here for a team that won 13 games last year despite only posting a point differential of 63 points. I agree as well. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see the Packers end the season with a losing record, especially if Aaron Rodgers finally snaps and revolts against leadership.
