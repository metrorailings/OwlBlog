My, was I so very wrong about this team last year. Aaron Rodgers led this team to the playoffs en route to a fantastic MVP season. Now that the offseason drama between Rodgers and the franchise has been quieted for a bit, the organization is moving ahead with Super Bowl aspirations.

In that vein, a move was made to replace the inept Mike Pettine with Joe Barry. Past history would indicate this is going to be a lateral move though - Barry's track record as defensive coordinator has been exceptionally ugly. Intuition tells me not to expect anything different this time around, as old dogs rarely change their ways.  Regardless of whatever schemes the man seems to run, Barry and his defenses have been routed time and time again. Adrian Amos saying earlier in the year that Barry's defensive philosophy isn't all too different from Pettine's worries me all the more. Pettine's style of defense was exactly what had gotten him ousted. A shift was needed, not a name plate change. Then again, should I really be surprised to see the team not straying all too far from Pettine's system given all his assistants were retained from last year.

The Packers desperately need another career year from Rodgers and Randall Cobb should they wish to overcome such their deficit at coaching. The franchise is too talented not to be winning its fair share of games this year. The problem becomes the postseason, when the team is truly tested against quality competition. Without adequate coaching, the team needs to be aces in all other categories.

Green Bay is justifiably the favorite to take the NFC North crown yet again this year. Minnesota, Detroit, and Chicago are still fighting uphill battles against incompetence and roster holes. The Packers issues are fewer in comparison. But another depressing breakdown is in the works unless the players can band together into an unstoppable force, similar to what happened with the New York Giants the last time Big Blue won the Super Bowl.
