**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the only major change comes with Sean Ryan arriving into the organization as its new quarterbacks coach, given the former guy left to go become a coordinator for a college team.

On defense, Mike Phair was apparently let go as the coach of the defensive line. His assistant from last year will be assuming oversight duties in his place. Interestingly enough, Kevin Gilbride's son will be starting a new role here in unfamiliar territory - defensive assistant.

The Carolina Panthers expectedly didn't win much last year, though the franchise wasn't short on fight. Despite deficiencies at certain spots along their roster, these Panthers were doing their best to win games in which they were decisive underdogs, a testament to the coaching on this team.

This year should be different. For one thing, all the fresh faces on the coaching staff from last year will be returning again this season. Coaching consistency helps a team adjust so much quicker to the rigors of a football season. Another major difference from last year - Teddy Bridgewater has been swapped out for Sam Darnold. Darnold may have been a complete bust up there in New York, but in all fairness to the young man, he wasn't given much in terms of weaponry or coaching. Helming a barebones offense under Adam Gase would be soul-crushing for most other quarterbacks in the league, so it's hard to fault the man much for failing miserably in his time with the Jets. Having sharper mentors in Matt Rhule and Joe Brady should be so much more beneficial to Darnold as he copes with the scars from his previous tenure. On top of that, the weapons are there at his disposal - a true swiss-knife player in Christian McCaffrey and two scrappy wideouts in Robby Anderson and D.J. Moore. Darnold has so much opportunity here to redeem his top billing coming out of college - whether he actually achieves that will be up to him. 

Those two things alone are major boons, but another major factor going in Carolina's favor this year will be the expected improvement on defense. Derrick Brown and Jeremy Chinn have one full year of experience under their belt, so even better things are expected from both players this year. Furthermore, the additions of Haason Reddick and A.J. Bouye give Carolina some added _oomph_ on both the front and back ends of the defense. Bouye's presence in particular is desperately needed given the cornerbacks on the roster are mostly pedestrian. The defense performing leaps and bounds better compared to last year is a bit of a stretch, but I am forecasting better days ahead for Phil Snow's unit.

Speaking of which, one thing I do remember watching Carolina last year were their exotic pass rushing packages. The Panthers made a living trying to catch opposing offenses by surprise by rushing players from all parts of the field. It's nice in theory when it works (like up in Baltimore), but this strategy only yielded mixed results for Carolina. Maybe what their pass rush truly needs is for Derrick Brown to step up and be that cornerstone player complimenting Brian Burns...

The Carolina Panthers of 2021 have a fairly high ceiling. A wild card invite to the playoffs is not out of the question here. It all depends on whether Sam Darnold can rejuvenate himself in a new setting.
