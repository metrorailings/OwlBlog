**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the only major change comes with Sean Ryan arriving into the organization as its new quarterbacks coach, given the former guy left to go become a coordinator for a college team.

On defense, Mike Phair was apparently let go as the coach of the defensive line. His assistant from last year will be assuming oversight duties in his place. Interestingly enough, Kevin Gilbride's son will be starting a new role here in unfamiliar territory - defensive assistant.
