**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Aside from losing their quarterbacks coach to the University of Arizona, New England has retained all their position coachs and assistants from last year. The only major new addition is Matt Patricia. Even though Patricia was absolutely worthless as a head coach, he can still serve Belichick well as a defensive assistant.

Much like the 49ers, a nagging injury to their star quarterback left the Patriots seriously crippled most of last year. Combined with a pretty barebones roster, New England had the makings of a bottom-feeder last year. But New England fought hard and managed to notch seven wins. Kudos to the coaching staff for somehow finding a way to win despite all their roster setbacks.

This free agency, Belichick spared no expense to beef up his personnel on both sides of the ball. Bags of money may have been handed out with damn near reckless abandon, but the Patriots now boast one of the most complete rosters in the league. When you pair all that acquired talent with a phenomenal coaching staff, you now have the makings of a true dark horse contender for the Super Bowl.

I say dark horse because the situation at quarterback remains hazy. Cam Newton is a truly dynamic player when he's fully healthy, but the problem is that he hasn't been healthy since his MVP year. Newton has become too brittle lately, and there's no reason to assume that'll be changing soon. It's not like Josh McDaniels is committed to making Cam a pocket passer. Frankly, Cam isn't meant to play quarterback in a traditional sense anyway - his strength is his speed and mobility. Newton needs to operate in an offense rooted in read-option plays and complex rushing concepts. It's exactly that type of offense that exposes a quarterback to hits though. So it won't be any real surprise if we see Cam sidelined yet again with lingering injuries. Belichick (being a forward-thinker) has a fairly capable back-up in Mac Jones, but the kid is only a rookie. It'll take time for him to acclimate to an offense as complex as Josh McDaniel's. Unless Jones can follow in Justin Herbert's footsteps and marshal an offense without any practice whatsoever, New England's quarterback situation will likely be more a liability than a boon as the season progresses
