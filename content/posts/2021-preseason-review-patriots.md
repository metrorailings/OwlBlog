The trajectory of this Patriots team will be interesting to watch.

On defense, expect some serious regression to the mean here. That dominant New England defense of yesteryear grew fat playing nothing but bad teams in six of their first eight games. A reputation built by feasting on bottom-feeders won't hold up against a much tougher schedule this year. More importantly though, many of the players that defined that defense have moved on or opted out of the season - D'onta Hightower, Patrick Chung, Kyle Van Noy, Jamie Collins, Danny Shelton, and Duron Harmon will be missed from New England's defensive ranks this season. This many critical soldiers missing in action cannot be good for any outfit, let alone the Patriots defense.

On offense though, things should be much better compared to last year. The bitter truth of last season was that Tom Brady was terrible. Maybe age finally caught up to him, but it's also pretty damn clear Brady wanted no part of the offense the Patriot coaches wanted to run. He failed to build rapport with any skill player not named Julian Edelman or James White. He'd pass up open receivers to force passes towards the few players he actually trusted. It was an ugly turn downward for him, and his move to Tampa Bay makes so much more sense in this light.

This year though, Belichick will be working with a former MVP in Cam Newton. And Cam is especially hungry this year, looking for some sort of redemption after being unceremoniously ousted from the Panthers. Unlike Tom, Bill has a truly dynamic figure in Cam - his mobility and athletic build should give Josh McDaniels plenty more material to load into his playbook. On top of that, Cam should be more willing to work with skill players who couldn't develop a bond with Brady. Not to mention Cam is much more willing to throw the ball outside the numbers.

So long as the offense can outpace the expected defensive regression, New England should be the favorite to take the division yet again. A long playoff trip is probably unlikely though.
