**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Aside from losing their quarterbacks coach to the University of Arizona, New England has retained all their position coachs and assistants from last year. The only major new addition is Matt Patricia. Even though Patricia was absolutely worthless as a head coach, he can still serve Belichick well as a defensive assistant.

Much like the 49ers, a nagging injury to their star quarterback left the Patriots seriously crippled most of last year. Combined with a pretty barebones roster, New England had the makings of a bottom-feeder last year. But the Patriots fought hard and managed to notch seven wins. Kudos to the coaching staff for somehow finding a way to win despite all their roster setbacks.

This free agency, Belichick spared no expense to beef up his personnel on both sides of the ball. Bags of money may have been handed out with damn near reckless abandon, but the Patriots now boast one of the more complete rosters in the league. When you pair all that acquired talent with a phenomenal coaching staff, you now have the makings of a true dark horse contender for the Super Bowl.

But for all their positives, their quarterback situation remains a bit hazy. Cam Newton's a truly dynamic player when he's fully healthy, but the problem is that he hasn't been healthy since his MVP season. Newton has become way too fragile lately, and little reason is there to assume things will be different this year. If anything, Josh McDaniels knows better than to limit Cam in a bid to protect him. Cam isn't suited to play quarterback from the pocket - his strengths lie more in his mobility. Newton needs to operate in an offense rooted in read-option plays and complex rushing concepts. Unfortunately, it's exactly those types of offense that expose a quarterback to hits. So it wouldn't really be a surprise if we see Cam sidelined yet again with lingering injuries. Belichick has a contingency plan here in Mac Jones, but the kid is only a rookie. It'll take time for him to acclimate to an offense as complex as Josh McDaniel's. Unless Jones can follow in Justin Herbert's footsteps and marshal an offense without much practice, New England's quarterback situation will likely be more a liability than a boon as the season progresses.

Still, outside of their quarterback position, New England doesn't really have any other glaring weaknesses. All their position groups feature at least one solid player. Best of all, their pass rush should make some tremendous gains with the return of Kyle Van Noy and the arrival of Matthew Judon. Not having a marquis pass rusher last year left their defense exposed way too much - even with a great defensive backfield, pass coverage can only be maintained for so long. Without players capable of haranguing opposing quarterbacks, defenses are more or less gutless. The same goes for offenses without any real skill players. But the Patriots won't be having that problem this year thanks to some key free agency moves. Signing Jonnu Smith and Hunter Henry gives New England that quality tight-end tandem that adds so much rich depth to their playbook. Throw in an excellent route runner in Nelson Agholor and the Patriots have all the ingredients for a consistently productive offense. If Newton, Damien Harris, and the offensive line can work together to actualize an effective ground game, New England will be surprising quite a few folks out there not expecting much from their offense.

The Patriots are a Super Bowl contender, albeit not a favorite. Barring major injury, I have high hopes for them.
