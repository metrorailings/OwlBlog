Vegas wasn't quite the bottom feeder I expected last year. It helped that their offense was loaded with playmakers. Gruden likely also incorporated some new concepts into his playbook last year, which probably threw off opposing game planners initially expecting more of the same from these Raiders.

I don't see much changing this year though. The biggest issues on offense still persist - namely Jon Gruden and Derek Carr. As the season develops, expect opposing coaches to tear down Gruden's tactics and strategies. Once that happens, history strongly suggests Gruden will fail to adjust. You pair that with a quarterback unable to improvise in adverse situations and you have the recipe for an offense that'll stall way too much for its own good.

Defensively, I'd be shocked if Gus Bradley can turn things around in his first year with the organization. His credentials after leaving Seattle have not been impressive in the least. On top of that, the defensive line still remains a shitshow. Mayock signed Yannick Ngakoue to address that issue, but it remains to be seen whether Yannick can actually have much of a positive impact here. Minnesota and Baltimore seemed all too content booting him out last year, which suggests something's off with the young man.

I see inertia being the defining theme of the Raiders this season. Nothing much will change this year compared to last.
