Vegas wasn't quite the bottom feeder I expected last year. It helped that their offense was loaded with playmakers. Gruden likely also incorporated some new concepts into his playbook last year, which probably threw off opposing game planners initially expecting more of the same from these Raiders.

I don't see much changing this year though. The biggest issues on offense still persist - namely Jon Gruden and Derek Carr. As the season develops, expect opposing coaches to tear down Gruden's tactics and strategies. Once that happens, Gruden will likely fail to adjust, if history is any guide. Pair that with a quarterback unable to improvise in adverse situations and you have the recipe for an offense that'll stall way too much for its own good.
