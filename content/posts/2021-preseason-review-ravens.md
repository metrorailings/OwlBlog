**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Wink Martindale's name was thrown out there last week as a potential head coaching candidate, but none of the teams interested in him ultimately hired him. 

On offense, the team was compelled to find a new wide receivers coach after losing David Culley over to the Houston Texans.  

On defense, we see some surprising turnover. A little shocking at first look, considering quality defenses tend not to entertain much turnover the next year. But the reality is that Baltimore's defensive assistants were poached by other organizations in the professional and collegiate realms. The Ravens needed to hire replacements to fill those vacancies. Anthony Weaver is now brought into the fold as the lead coach training up the defensive line. Martindale's old friend (and disheveled firebrand) Rob Ryan is now inside the organization as the man overseeing the inside linebacker unit. Lastly, the secondary will now be managed by a new face in D'Anton Lynn.

Baltimore's a strange team. It's a franchise loaded with so much talent and capable coaches. But their situation at quarterback isn't anywhere as rosy as some of the team's fans may believe.
