**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Wink Martindale's name was thrown out there last week as a potential head coaching candidate, but none of the teams interested in him ultimately hired him.

On offense, the team was compelled to find a new wide receivers coach after losing David Culley over to the Houston Texans.

On defense, we see some surprising turnover. A little shocking at first look, considering quality defenses tend not to entertain much turnover the next year. But the reality is that Baltimore's defensive assistants were poached by other organizations in the professional and collegiate realms. The Ravens needed to hire replacements to fill those vacancies. Anthony Weaver is now brought into the fold as the lead coach training up the defensive line. Martindale's old friend (and disheveled firebrand) Rob Ryan is now inside the organization as the man overseeing the inside linebacker unit. Lastly, the secondary will now be managed by a new face in D'Anton Lynn.

Baltimore's a strange team. It's a franchise loaded to the gills with talent. The coaching is pretty respectably too. Yet the past two years have been depressingly underwhelming, to say the least. After an MVP year, Lamar Jackson and company fizzled out early in the postseason against the massive underdogs. Last year was a bit better in that the team was able to notch their first playoff win in the Lamar Jackson era, but their championship hopes ended pretty dismally in the next round.

So much of that failure has to be borne on the shoulders of Lamar Jackson as well as the limited scope of Greg Roman's playbook. Lamar has trouble playing the role of a conventional quarterback. Much like Cam Newton, he's at his best running an exotic offense that leverages his speed and other physical talents. But reading coverages and anticipating windows? Not in his wheelhouse. Roman's not helping much by insisting Lamar play from the shotgun either. It'd be so much more helpful if Lamar's allowed to run a simpler offense from under center, but Roman feels otherwise.

On top of that, the team's missing quite a few key players from last year, either through injury, offseason transactions, or free agency. The vacancies on defense may hurt all the more given the new position coaches on that side of the ball. The defensive line coach especially has his work cut out for him, what with the team losing its only marquis pass rusher in the offseason. Pernell McPhee can still play well, but his production has been in free fall since his glory days in Chicago.
