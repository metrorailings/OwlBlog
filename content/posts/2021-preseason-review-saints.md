**COACHING TURNOVER**  
We see quite a bit of reorganization on the offensive staff, partly because quarterbacks coach Joe Lombardi left the team to become the Chargers offensive coordinator. On top of that, roles were modified, perhaps as a consequence of Drew Brees retiring and leaving the reins of the offense to two quarterbacks who haven't fully proven themselves mentally capable of taking charge.

Things are thankfully mostly unchanged on defense, although just like the offense, the defensive staff saw one of its own leave the team over the offseason to go become a defensive coordinator. Kris Richard was brought in to replace former secondaries coach Aaron Glenn. Perhaps this is a bit of an upgrade, considering the Saints secondary had a down year last season.

Another solid prediction last year, though it wasn't that difficult of a prediction to make given Drew Brees having a pitiful year was all too easy to forecast.

This year will be so much more difficult to predict, mostly because the quarterback situation is a bit hazy. Presumably the job was Jameis Winston's to lose, but it seems as if Taysom Hill has a legitimate shot at being the starter. I'm not sure if the Saints can truly execute an offense predicated on a drop-back passing game, especially with Taysom at its helm. Hill did well enough in relief duty, but four games alone can only tell us so much about a passer's talents. I mean...Drew Lock was looking like a budding superstar in his first batch of games, only to crash back down to earth the next season when defenses gained a beat on him. Taysom's physical talents are exactly what limit his potential as a passer - his athleticism gave him an excuse to never fully develop as a traditional quarterback.

On the other side of things, Jameis may never be cut out to start in this league. It's really shameful that Taysom was able to start over him last year in relief duty after Drew Brees was sidelined - after all, Jameis was always seen as the more seasoned quarterback, equipped with more of the tools necessary to run the type of offense head coach Sean Payton wants to run. That doesn't seem to be the case, especially now that Taysom is being given opportunities in training camp to compete for the starting role.

Add on top of that the fiasco concerning Michael Thomas. For reasons not entirely known to me, an unbridgeable rift has formed between Thomas and the organization. Thomas is all but assured to be traded away, leaving the Saints completely bereft of any real weaponry outside of Alvin Kamara and Deonte Harris. New Orleans' offensive coaches will need to push their creative boundaries should they want to sustain any success on offense. One thing going in their favor will be the shifting identity of the offense now that Drew Brees is no longer its signal caller. Defenses can only wait and react to whatever modifications Payton will inevitably make to his playbook now that either Winston or Hill will be his starting quarterback.

On defense, things shouldn't change much. Losing Trey Hendrickson to free agency hurts, but if Onyemata can continue playing well, the Saints have a one-two punch at pass rush. It doesn't help that he's been suspended for six games, but New Orleans can survive without him. If anything, that might serve them well, as the man should be in better health going into the postseason...assuming they qualify for the postseason in the first place.

And that's the thing - I can't make any bold assertions about this team given the uncertainty around its offense. Sean Payton has been heralded as an offensive genius, and it'll take every bit of that genius to keep that unit productive through the season. If Payton can pull off a bit of his magic here, expect a postseason nod and possibly so much more.
