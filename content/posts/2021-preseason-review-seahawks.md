**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Interestingly enough, we don't see too much turnover on the offensive coaching staff despite Shane Waldron's arrival as the new coordinator on offense. Waldron seems to have only brought over one or two assistants to join him in his new role in Seattle. No idea if this bodes well for a Seattle team transitioning to a different style of offense.

My expectations last year were pretty spot-on, aside from Russell Wilson sucking down the stretch as Seattle stumbled into the postseason.

This year presents way too many unknowns for my liking here. Russell probably stands here as the most important uncertainty. His play from last year was sensational up until he started believing too much in his own MVP hype. That hype fizzled out pretty quickly though once winter reared itself into view. Can he pull off an Aaron Rodgers and blossom into an elite quarterback again after a disappointing year? Rodgers had a fire in his belly that was stoked after Green Bay's managers drafted a quarterback in the first round. It was the audacity of the Packers drafting somebody to replace him that drove Rodgers to play brilliantly last year. Wilson's situation is similar in mood, but not context - Russ is unhappy with Seattle for an altogether different set of reasons. Despite lobbying for a trade, Pete Carroll and John Schneider elected to keep him inside the organization and settle his issues privately. Things now appear fine, with Russ saying all the right things to the media as the team prepares for training camp. While it's obvious (in hindsight) what motivated Rodgers to play so well last season, it's not so obvious if Wilson has any real motivation to truly play better.

But Russell _might_ be helped by the presence of former Rams assistant coach Shane Waldron, who Seattle poached over the offseason. Waldron was raised in the Shanahan/McVay style of offensive football, so I expect the Hawks to start incorporating more play-action, quarterback options, and crossing routes in their playbook. In theory, Seattle should be so much more productive given these offensive concepts cater well to their strengths, namely their ground game.
