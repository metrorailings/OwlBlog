**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Interestingly enough, we don't see too much turnover on the offensive coaching staff despite Shane Waldron's arrival as the new coordinator on offense. Waldron seems to have only brought over one or two assistants to join him in his new role in Seattle. No idea if this bodes well for a Seattle team transitioning to a different style of offense.
