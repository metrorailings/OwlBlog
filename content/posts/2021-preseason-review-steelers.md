**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Coaching consistency has been the hallmark of these Pittsburgh Steelers going back the last couple decades. This year is no different - outside of a few assistant coaches, Pittsburgh has kept most of their coaching staff from last season. Offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner was let go following a disappointing year for the Steelers offense. His quarterbacks coach was promoted to coordinator, but I'm skeptical anything will seriously change so long as Big Ben remains quarterback.

So much talent, but it all matters little so long as they're carrying dead weight at the quarterback situation. Nobody in that quarterback room can really perform at a serviceable level, especially Roethlisberger. Last season, _Philip Rivers_ actually threw the ball deeper than Big Ben, according to Next Gen Stats. Rivers (being a man with two eyes) smartly retired after the season ended. But for reasons no rational mind will ever fathom, Roethlisberger decided to give football another go this year.

Perhaps Matt Canada can spice things up with some wrinkles, but it remains to be seen how much this Steeler offense can actually change given Ben's an old dog set in his ways. If Canada really wants this offense to be more effective, more playbook real estate should be given to exotic run formations and creative rushing plays leveraging the skill sets of their halfbacks. Even though the rushing game can only take an offense so far, it would be a welcome change of pace from a passing game I expect to be flaccid. Although if Matt Canada truly wants to go a little nuts, I'd recommend he bench Roethlisberger in favor of Mason Rudolph or Joshua Dobbs - at least those two would be willing to chuck the ball deep every now and then.

Pittsburgh is a good team. Their wins this season will likely come off the backs of their defense and their skill players. Is another postseason visit likely? Doubtful. As I said, Ben Roethlisberger isn't just a poor passer, but an outright liability weighing this entire team down by the neck. Entrusting your offense to a quarterback playing way past his golden years is a recipe for disaster, regardless of how talented the rest of the offense may be. It seems Vegas agrees as well - Roethlisberger is expected to cost his team as many games as they'll be winning. Their schedule isn't easy to stomach too, as I only see them playing three easy opponents - the rest of the schedule's packed with genuine contenders. Don't be surprised if the Steelers miss the playoffs.
