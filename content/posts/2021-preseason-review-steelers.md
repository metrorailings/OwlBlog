**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Coaching consistency has been the hallmark of these Pittsburgh Steelers going back the last couple decades. This year is no different - outside of a few assistant coaches, Pittsburgh has kept most of their coaching staff. Last year's offensive coordinator, Randy Fichtner, was let go following a disappointing year for the Steelers offense. His quarterbacks coach was promoted to coordinator, but I'm skeptical anything will seriously change so long as Big Ben remains quarterback.

So much talent, but it all matters little so long as they're carrying dead weight at the quarterback situation. Nobody in that quarterback room can really perform at a serviceable level, especially Roethlisberger. Last season, _Philip Rivers_ actually threw the ball deeper than Big Ben, according to Next Gen Stats. Rivers, being a man with two eyes, smartly retired after the season ended. But for reasons I'm sure no rational mind can fathom, Roethlisberger decided to give football another go this year.
