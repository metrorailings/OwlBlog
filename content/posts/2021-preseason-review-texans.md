Houston may be this year's biggest train wreck. When you combine a barebones roster with an entirely new set of managers, a milquetoast season is all but assured. 

Think of Houston as a case study in inept ownership. Cal McNair has failed this team pretty spectacularly - the kook doesn't have the intellect or discipline to act in the best interests of the franchise. His obsequious dedication to Jack Easterby has single-handedly devastated the team's morale and sense of unity. I'd like to think any other owner would have more than enough common sense to run somebody as divisive as Easterby out of town, if only for the sake of restoring harmony. Even if McNair was absolutely convinced Easterby was an innocent man undeserving of the hate directed his way, it's obvious that the torrential forces driving the franchise apart would never cease so long as Jack is present inside the building. 

But McNair sees Easterby more than just a valuable employee - Easterby is his spiritual guru. In Christian terms, I suppose Cal sees Jack as his own personal shepherd guiding him in all matters of life, including football. Because McNair holds the moron in such high esteem, Jack Easterby will always be involved in the Texans' affairs, probably until he retires.

So without even delving into the coaching staffs or the personnel, we know conclusively that Houston's potential is capped, at least for the foreseeable future. So long as team morale remains perpetually compromised, these Texans will need spectacular coaches and solid players across most positions to achieve meaningful success. Here's hoping Deshaun Watson finds a new home next year.

Actually...let me take that back. Deshaun Watson may be the first football player to have his career destroyed by a sickening fetish. Criminal investigations are still pending as I type this, but just given the sheer volume of sexual harassment complaints filed against him by masseuses, it's clear Deshaun has a serious issue when it comes to his sexual fantasies. It's not something that's likely to be fixed too, considering sexual fetishes are ingrained pretty deeply into our neurological wiring. It's honestly sad considering that him and Mahomes are probably the best newer generation quarterbacks. A player of his caliber deserves at least one championship nod, but his career will be flushed down the toilet if any of those harassment allegations actually results in a criminal charge.

Just a sad state of affairs in Houston. Texans fans may be wallowing in misery for a long time.
