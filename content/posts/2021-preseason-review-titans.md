**COACHING TURNOVER**  
With Arthur Smith leaving for Atlanta, last year's tight ends coach was promoted to take over as offensive coordinator. Besides the addition of a few new assistants, nothing else changed on offense.

On defense, Shane Bowen was officially promoted from linebackers coach to defensive coordinator. The move is a bit bizarre considering Bowen was essentially the acting coordinator last year. Despite overseeing a historically bad defense, Bowen seems to have been rewarded with a promotion formalizing his role as head of the defense. A worrying move, to say the least. On a positive note though, Jim Schwartz was also brought on board in what is likely a consulting role.

Despite statistical regression working its hex over the defense, Tennessee managed to fight their way back into the playoffs, largely thanks to another great year of rushing by Derrick Henry. It's without question at this point that Henry is the best tailback in the league.

But last year's disaster at defense wasn't just a case of a unit trending back towards the mean performance-wise after an outlier year. By raw numbers alone, it was historically bad. Tennessee was the only team last year giving up conversions on more than half their third downs. That sort of shameful achievement is only possible when coaches are just as inept as the players they train. I never thought one man could make so much a difference on a coaching staff, but that defensive unit under Dean Pees versus Shane Bowen was night and day - Pees had this unit humming together gracefully while Bowen fielded a bunch of men who could barely act in concert with one another. The fact that Bowen has been promoted formally into the coordinator role this year is worrying here, though he'll have a few things this season that weren't there last year. One, he'll have the services of a proven defensive mastermind in Jim Schwartz advising him. Two, he may actually have a viable pass rush now that the Titans spent top dollar on a marquis pass rusher in free agency. Bud Dupree finally gives this franchise the dominant edge rusher it's been missing for several years. With Dupree in the trenches alongside him, Harold Landry will be given more leash to harangue opposing quarterbacks. And with Schwartz advising the defensive coaches, expect the organization to commit more time and resources to a defensive philosophy prioritizing the pass rush. Vrabel and company should be able to turn things around and at least field a middling unit based on the improved pass rush alone.

Tennessee's offense remains the heart and soul of the franchise. Ryan Tannehill has blossomed into a first-class quarterback under Vrabel and Arthur Smith. Even though Smith is no longer with the organization, I'm not forecasting anything substantial to really change on offense considering management simply moved a position coach into the coordinator role while keeping all the other coaches on the offensive staff. Wide receiver Corey Davis and tight end Jonnu Smith will be missed, but the hope here is that the older Julio Jones can make up for their lost production.

The Titans are definitely a Super Bowl contender so long as their pass rush evolves into something fierce, Derrick Henry keeps trucking over opposing defenders, and their offensive coaching remains competent despite the loss of Arthur Smith. All three of those things happen, Tennessee has a legit shot at the Lombardi trophy come February.
