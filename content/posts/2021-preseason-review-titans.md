**COACHING TURNOVER**  
With Arthur Smith leaving for Atlanta, last year's tight ends coach was promoted to take over as offensive coordinator. Besides the addition of a few new assistants, nothing else changed on offense.

On defense, Shane Bowen was officially promoted from linebackers coach to defensive coordinator. The move is a bit bizarre considering Bowen was essentially the acting coordinator last year. Despite overseeing a historically bad defense, Bowen seems to have been rewarded with a promotion formalizing his role as head of the defense. A worrying move, to say the least. On a positive note though, Jim Schwartz was also brought on board in what is likely a consulting role.

Despite statistical regression working its hex over the defense, Tennessee managed to fight their way back into the playoffs, largely thanks to another great year of rushing by Derrick Henry. It's without question at this point that Henry is the best tailback in the league.

But last year's disaster at defense wasn't just a case of a unit trending back towards the mean performance-wise after an outlier year. By raw numbers alone, it was historically bad.
