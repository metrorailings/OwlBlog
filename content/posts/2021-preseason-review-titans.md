The Titans were the upset special last year, winning as heavy underdogs against the championship favorite Ravens. Tennessee was able to pull off this feat in part thanks to some sensational running from Derrick Henry. Henry gashed and wore defenses down with some of the best hard-nosed rushing I've seen in a long while. With defenses committing more energy towards stopping the ground game, Ryan Tannehill and the passing attack were given enough oxygen to blossom. So for once, Tennessee actually had a fully competent offense.

The Titans also had an unexpectedly great defense in spite of their lack of pass rush or raw talent. During the playoffs last season, I remember being impressed by Dean Pees and Mike Vrabel for the work they've done fielding a defense far better than the sum of its parts. It speaks quite a bit to a their ability to pull together a highly functional unit from otherwise pedestrian personnel.

Unfortunately, statistical regression will be their biggest enemy this season. The reality is that the Titans cannot sustain their current level of play. For one thing, tailbacks with great seasons usually follow them up with disappointing outings the next year. And it makes sense - workhorse halfbacks punish their bodies to put up those gaudy numbers. All those hits and tackles add up. Another thing, that defense far outplayed its actual potential. Defenses don't usually stay consistent from year-to-year, especially without much talent. Beasley was their biggest acquisition during free agency, and I'd argue his value is very limited. Dean Pees retiring doesn't help, that's for sure.

Vrabel is a damn fine coach. On top of that, these Titans have heart. But the team overplayed its hand last season and a pullback is all but certain. I'm not even sure if a playoff appearance is in the stars for them this year given their schedule is a bit rough.
