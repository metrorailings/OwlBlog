**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, Klint Kubiak's now assumed coordinator duties over the offense in the wake of his dad's retirement. Given that apples don't really fall too far from the tree in today's NFL, I expect very little to change with the Minnesota offense. But who knows, maybe Klint is an exception to this rule...

On defense, Paul Guenther has been brought on-board as a senior assistant. Hopefully, he can still offer some value to a veteran like Mike Zimmer.

How did I miss on these Vikings so bad last year? I considered them dark horse championship contenders, especially after their acquisition of Yannick Ngakoue. Instead, Minnesota couldn't even sniff the postseason last year.

While I don't have the will or the patience to sit through all of Minnesota's losing performances from last season, one theme that I remembered popping up again and again was Kirk Cousins being a liability. Despite all the considerable weaponry at his disposal, Cousins always found a way to keep the other team in the game in most of their losing efforts. And I think that points to an even bigger issue - a stale playbook. Go back one year before when Cousins and Kubiak found success orchestrating deep passes off bootlegs and other play-action concepts. Defenses tend to take their sweet time to adjust, but they eventually adjust. And I think that's what happened here - opposing defenses decoded the Vikings schemes on offense. Without a reliable dropback passing game, Minnesota's offense stalled out way too much, especially in the first half of the season when the team posted a record of 1-5 before their bye.

Is that going to change this year? I'd hope so - Klint Kubiak as offensive coordinator is likely the single most important determinant as to whether the Vikings can stake themselves as a top-tier team. For their sake, Klint needs to find novel ways to make Kirk Cousins productive.

On defense, Minnesota underperformed last year, primarily due to an awful pass rush as well as a lack of experience among their cornerbacks ranks. This year should result in a marked change, if only because Danielle Hunter is returning from injured reserve and their starting cornerbacks from last year have a full season of experience under their belt. Patrick Peterson's veteran experience should also help that unit mature even quicker. Perhaps best of all, the team scooped up one of the most underrated defensive tackles in the league in Dalvin Tomlinson. Once New York idiotically refused to sign him back, Minnesota seized upon the opportunity to fortify the middle of their defensive front with a proven player. No, he's not as solid a pass-rushing threat as a Chris Jones or an Akiem Hicks, but I have little doubt Dalvin will cement himself as one of the team's best pass rushers.

So is Minnesota likely to see a turnaround? I'm not too sure. It's incredibly difficult to forecast their prospects this season given the x factors on coaching. That being said, I have faith in Mike Zimmer to do better than last year, so if I had to bet on an outcome here, I'd bet on the Vikings making at least one postseason appearance this year.
