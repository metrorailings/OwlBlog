**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, Klint Kubiak's now assumed coordinator duties over the offense in the wake of his dad's retirement. Given that apples don't really fall too far from the tree in today's NFL, I expect very little to change with the Minnesota offense. But who knows, maybe Klint is an exception to this rule...

On defense, Paul Guenther has been brought on-board as a senior assistant. Hopefully, he can still offer some value to a veteran like Mike Zimmer.
