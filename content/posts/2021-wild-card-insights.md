## Raiders @ Bengals

So far, the Bengals have yet to demonstrate any real nerves. Joe Burrow has been very calm and cool in his debut playoff drive.

Raiders and their cover-three are easy pickings for Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase. Chase lining up along sidelines virtually guarantees him a one-vs-one match-up against Brandon Facyson.

Two Raiders drives in a row tainted by a false start that effectively killed their drives. It's worth noting Las Vegas didn't accrue any false start penalties in their crucial win last week against the Chargers. Who said home-field advantage didn't matter?

Sam Hubbard has been a force in the first half. I might have made a mistake not considering him a potentially elite pass rusher.

Hmm...the Bengals actually holding up in pass protection against Maxx Crosby and Yannick Ngakoue. Interesting...is that protection sustainable into the second half?

Well, simply put, this game was won in the trenches by the Bengals. The Raiders were never comfortable. Too many times Derek Carr looked lost while looking around for open players to catch his passes. Apparently, Cincinnati's press coverage was so good. And yet it never occurred to Carr or offensive coordinator Greg Olson to run more timing routes or rub routes to take advantage of the Bengals playing such tight coverage.

Maybe Lou Anaramo deserves a bit more credit as a defensive mind than I thought, but I I can't say for sure. Greg Olson is anything but a mastermind, so tamping down the Raider defense isn't nearly as impressive as one might first judge.

In the end, Cincinnati won riding the game on their shoulders of their elite quarterback and home field advantage shaking these weak-minded Raiders. Odd that the Raiders mounting over four comebacks this season didn't do them many favors in this game. Maybe what's key is recording the exact nature of the comeback. Three of those comebacks came at home. The other comeback came against a Cleveland squad ravaged by COVID.

## Patriots @ Bills

The Bills are playing contrary to the way they played in their last game against the Patriots. Instead of running crossing routes, receivers like Isaiah McKenzie are running whip routes back outside, forcing Patriot defenders to catch up from a trailing position. Some fine coaching courtesy of Brian Daboll.

Patriots are trying to catch the Bills off-guard too by having Mac Jones throw the ball from the get-go. Still, it's not an easy ask for him to assume the mantle of production in hostile territory, especially with sub-zero wind chills.
