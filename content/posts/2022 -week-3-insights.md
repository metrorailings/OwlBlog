## Steelers @ Browns

The Steelers are feeling TJ Watt's absence, especially considering the extended minutes they're playing thanks to the ineptitude of their offense.

Mitchell Trubisky is not the solution. Things are only going to get worse if Pittsburgh's brain trust keeps insisting on trotting him out there as the leader of their offense.

Amari Cooper's day is up and down. Some critical drops, but also some highlight plays. I would say under Brissett, the key receivers are more Donovan Peoples-Jones and David Njoku.

Myles Garrett still a dominant force. It remains to be see whether the same can be said of Jadaveon Clowney, if he ever comes back healthy.

Denzel Ward isn't a good cornerback. Lost occasionally, relies on physicality bordering on penalty to try and break up passes...

George Pickens could be a real gamer for Pittsburgh's offense.

## Eagles @ Commanders

Quez Watkins is the Eagles deep passing threat, certified. Thinking he may be a significant weapon on this offense.

Carson and his tendency to play hero ball is backfiring tremendously here. Get rid of the fucking ball, Carson.

Not good, Wentz. I think the maxim here is that Carson can perform well against _bad_ teams. Against good teams, never side with Carson. His passes have been pathetic and lacking any mustard.

It's also noteworthy that Washington's offensive coach is still insisting on seven-stop drops after seeing his quarterback get brutalized in the first quarter. Against teams that can ably rush the passer, it's clear Washington's more than happy to gamble.

## Chiefs @ Colts

I suspect the Colts pass rush is lacking. I also suspect Matt Ryan is a surprising liability for the offense. What is it about Frank Reich turning washed-up quarterbacks into albatrosses?

***

## Texans @ Bears

Khalil Herbert is a beast. I need to assess whether he's consistently successful rushing the ball, but his explosiveness can't be denied.

***

## Bills @ Dolphins

Tua with the deep pass on 3rd and 22 to set up a touchdown. Impressive. I'm seeing evolution here. Last year, I couldn't see Tua making these passes consistently. But carrying over from last game, it seems Tagavailoa's not afraid to chance these passes when the opportunity presents itself.

## Ravens @ Patriots

Mac Jones, on top of back issues, took a hard hit to his leg. Pretty clear the man's going to be suffering through much of the season going at his current pace.

***

## Packers @ Buccaneers

Tampa Bay's scripted plays opening up the game have been fantastic. Not bad. I do want to see a bit more running.

Likewise, the same can be said of Green Bay's scripted plays. Romeo Doubs especially doing some good work in the opening drive.

I'm a little concerned here by the Buccaneers defense here. They're not doing a great job limiting rushing yardage or pressuring Rodgers. It's very unusual, especially considering the humidity should be favoring them today. Have these Buccaneers lost a step? Why?

Matt LaFleur seems to have went out of his way to prepare his team for the intense heat over the past three weeks. I wonder if that's the key difference here. Either that or the fact that the offensive line is playing at full health now that David Bakhtieri is back. It'll be instructive to look at the pressure numbers once this game is over.

These Buccaneer depth receivers are just trash. Two fumbles to end two promising drives.

This Green Bay team has a championship defense. Great defensive backs combined with a defensive line headlined by two studs in Preston Smith and Rashan Gary.

One of the keys here to winning was Tampa Bay managing steady production on offense through scheme. That's clearly not the case here. It's just...bad strategy. I wonder if Brady is pushing this emphasis on passing now that Bruce Arians is no longer there to check him.

I can't stress this enough, but the key metric here is that before their final drive, Tampa Bay rushed 11 times and tried to pass 29 times. Nearly a 75-25 split with depth receivers. I don't understand this. I thought Brady and Byron Leftwich would recognize the passing game would have to be more muted in favor of the ground game, but that wasn't the case.

## 49ers @ Broncos

Russell still looks very uncomfortable in this offense. Odd. We know he's overrated, but to drop off this much from last year is alarming.

I'm thinking Garoppalo preselects his shots. Really not able to adjust after the snap.
