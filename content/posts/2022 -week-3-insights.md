## Steelers @ Browns

The Steelers are feeling TJ Watt's absence, especially considering the extended minutes they're playing thanks to the ineptitude of their offense.

Mitchell Trubisky is not the solution. Things are only going to get worse if Pittsburgh's brain trust keeps insisting on trotting him out there as the leader of their offense.

Amari Cooper's day is up and down. Some critical drops, but also some highlight plays. I would say under Brissett, the key receivers are more Donovan Peoples-Jones and David Njoku.

Myles Garrett still a dominant force. It remains to be see whether the same can be said of Jadaveon Clowney, if he ever comes back healthy.

Denzel Ward isn't a good cornerback. Lost occasionally, relies on physicality bordering on penalty to try and break up passes...

George Pickens could be a real gamer for Pittsburgh's offense.

## Eagles @ Commanders

Quez Watkins is the Eagles deep passing threat, certified. Thinking he may be a significant weapon on this offense.

Carson and his tendency to play hero ball is backfiring tremendously here. Get rid of the fucking ball, Carson.

Not good, Wentz. I think the maxim here is that Carson can perform well against _bad_ teams. Against good teams, never side with Carson. His passes have been pathetic and lacking any mustard.

It's also noteworthy that Washington's offensive coach is still insisting on seven-stop drops after seeing his quarterback get brutalized in the first quarter.

## Chiefs @ Colts

I suspect the Colts pass rush is lacking. I also suspect Matt Ryan is a surprising liability for the offense. What is it about Frank Reich turning washed-up quarterbacks into albatrosses?
