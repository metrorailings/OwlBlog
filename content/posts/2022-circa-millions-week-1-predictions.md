Ahhh...football. So sweet to see the game return in all its glory.

That being said, the first few weeks can be very unpredictable at times. Certainly not impossible. The one thing in our favor is that it'll take a while for the sportsbooks to catch on to teams that end up missing expectations wildly. If we can forecast the teams that will outperform or underwhelm relative to preseason expectations, we can notch some easy points just picking the games in which those teams are involved. Of course, it's a lot easier said than done. But let's see what I can do...

Both are division rivals who met each other twice last year. Each won a match on their own home field, though it's worth noting Green Bay was the major beneficiary of an untimely injury to Kirk Cousins forcing Sean Mannion into action as the starting quarterback in a primetime game taking place outside on an 11 degree night. That being said, Minnesota let up more than 30 points in both contests.

I know it's a little risky betting on a road favorite so early in the system, but the Vikings are introducing a new head coach who has no prior experience being in such a role. It's hard for a rookie head coach to prepare his men for game day. History attests to this - rookie head coaches have mostly lost their opening games.
