Ahhh...football. So sweet to see the game return in all its glory.

That being said, the first few weeks can be very unpredictable at times. Certainly not impossible. The one thing in our favor is that it'll take a while for the sportsbooks to catch on to teams that end up missing expectations wildly. If we can forecast the teams that will outperform or underwhelm relative to preseason expectations, we can notch some easy points just picking the games in which those teams are involved. Of course, it's a lot easier said than done. But let's see what I can do...

***

### Packers vs Vikings (+1.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Not applicable

##### _Injuries_

Allen Lazard is doubtful to play, an absence that really hurts given Green Bay already lacks skill players that have rapport with Rodgers.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

Both are division rivals who met each other twice last year. Each won a match on their own home field, though it's worth noting Green Bay was the major beneficiary of an untimely injury to Kirk Cousins right forcing Sean Mannion into action as the starting quarterback against them on an 11 degree night. That being said, Minnesota let up more than 30 points in both contests.

***

### Uncertain

***

It's a difficult match to assess in light of Allen Lazard being likely sidelined. If Lazard was healthy, I'd be more than happy to pick Green Bay here. But Rodgers being without his top receiving threat (allegedly) worries me - if Sammy Watkins and old man Randall Cobb are the two main receivers lining up in the wings, the Packers may have a rough time sustaining production in the passing game.

On the other side, Minnesota is coming into the game with a rookie head coach making his debut in that position. History suggests rookie head coaches don't fare well in their first outing. And I'm not entirely certain Kevin O'Connell is cut out to marshal an NFL team into battle yet.

### 49ers @ Bears (+7)

***

##### _Streaks_

Not applicable

##### _Injuries_

George Kittle is questionable to play, a little concerning given sophomore quarterback Trey Lance will be starting in his first-ever game as the team's official franchise quarterback.

##### _Weather_

Some rain is expected

##### _History_

Both these teams met last October. It took four full quarters, but San Francisco was finally able to run away with the lead and cover as 4-point favorites.

***

### 49ers -7

***

Once again, the guiding principle here in siding with the 49ers is that rookie head coaches tend to struggle in their first game. It's hard siding with somebody like Trey Lance as a seven point road favorite, but it's not like Justin Fields is much better. On top of that, Fields has a habit of wilting against pressure, something the 49ers defensive linemen should have no issue exploiting against Chicago's mediocre offensive front.

### Eagles @ Lions (+4)

***

##### _Streaks_

Not applicable

##### _Injuries_

The Lions have some issues along the trenches, but nothing serious.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

Both these teams met in the middle of the season last year. The Eagles absolutely obliterated Detroit. It was a complete joke - Jalen Hurts only threw for 103 yards. What may have happened is that Philadelphia's offense may have experimented with prioritizing the running game over the passing attack - Detroit's defensive coaching staff may have then been caught completely off guard, ultimately resulting in their defense being humiliated.

***

### Eagles -4

***

It's noteworthy that Vegas hasn't shifted the odds much from last year despite the way Philadelphia smashed these Lions. Perhaps the oddsmakers are thinking that Detroit was also caught completely off-guard by the Eagles' sudden shift in identity on offense. Whatever the reason, Philadelphia in once again handicapped as a 4-point favorite on the road. I think Philadelphia will again win this game in dominant fashion - it's a club that's clearly gotten much better over the offseason. The same really can't be said about Detroit, despite all the love people have been throwing their way thanks to Hard Knocks. The team didn't do much in the offseason to really bolster their roster. A premium pick was spent on a defensive linemen and a few moves were made in free agency, but not much else was done. The most significant change this year came on the coaching staff, with Ben Johnson replacing Anthony Lynn as the offensive coordinator. Sure, Johnson can make an immediate impact, but history suggests system changes usually take time.

### Jaguars @ Commanders (-2.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Not applicable

##### _Injuries_

The Jaguars are mostly healthy, while the Commanders are a little thin at safety. Overall, nothing too concerning for either team.

##### _Weather_

Expect a rainy affair.

##### _History_

No recent history between these two organizations

***

### Jaguars +2.5

***

A little risky going for the Jaguars here considering a new coaching regime is in place, but Doug Pederson is not a rookie head coach. On top of that, I think Trevor Laurence has far more upside than Carson Wentz, especially now that he's paired with a competent head coach.

***

***

### Chiefs @ Cardinals (+6)

***

##### _Streaks_

Not applicable

##### _Injuries_

The Cardinals are banged up across the roster. The injuries eliciting the most concern come on offense, with multiple offensive linemen, wide receiver Rondale Moore, and starting tight end Zack Ertz all dealing with various afflictions.

##### _Weather_

Dome game.

##### _History_

No recent history between these two teams

***

### Cardinals +6

***

A little risky given the injury epidemic sweeping through Arizona's locker room currently, but Kliff Kingsbury's been spectacular at readying his team in time or the season opener. I remember being hesitant about picking the Cardinals last year in week one, as they were going up against a solid Tennessee team, but Arizona dominated that game from start to finish. While I doubt the Cardinals can achieve that level of dominance here against Patrick Mahomes, the fact that they're being given so many points at home gives them quite a bit of cushion here.

***

***

### Broncos @ Seahawks (+6.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Not applicable

##### _Injuries_

Both teams are coming into this contest quite healthy

##### _Weather_

A beautiful September night

##### _History_

No recent history between these two teams

***

### Seahawks +6.5

***

Seattle has some promising potential here.
