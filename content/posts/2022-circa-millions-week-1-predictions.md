Ahhh...football. So sweet to see the game return in all its glory.

That being said, the first few weeks can be very unpredictable at times. Certainly not impossible. The one thing in our favor is that it'll take a while for the sportsbooks to catch on to teams that end up missing expectations wildly. If we can forecast the teams that will outperform or underwhelm relative to preseason expectations, we can notch some easy points just picking the games in which those teams are involved. Of course, it's a lot easier said than done. But let's see what I can do...

### Packers vs Vikings (+1.5)

##### _Streaks_

Not applicable

##### _Injuries_

Allen Lazard is doubtful to play, an absence that really hurts given Green Bay already lacks skill players that have rapport with Rodgers.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

Both are division rivals who met each other twice last year. Each won a match on their own home field, though it's worth noting Green Bay was the major beneficiary of an untimely injury to Kirk Cousins right forcing Sean Mannion into action as the starting quarterback against them on an 11 degree night. That being said, Minnesota let up more than 30 points in both contests.

### Uncertain

It's a difficult match to assess in light of Allen Lazard being likely sidelined. If Lazard was healthy, I'd be more than happy to pick Green Bay here. But Rodgers being without his top receiving threat (allegedly) worries me - if Sammy Watkins and old man Randall Cobb are the two main receivers lining up in the wings, the Packers may have a rough time sustaining production in the passing game.

On the other side, Minnesota is coming into the game with a rookie head coach making his debut in that position. History suggests rookie head coaches don't fare well in their first outing. And I'm not entirely certain Kevin O'Connell is cut out to marshal an NFL team into battle yet.
