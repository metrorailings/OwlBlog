New rule - never pick teams that struggle to win if they're taking anything short of 4 points. I learned my lesson the hard way, seeing two of my selections result in pushes despite the team I favored playing so much better. But the reality is that Atlanta and Los Angeles are teams not currently built to win in adverse circumstances. In Atlanta's case, their team lost some of its swagger as the game progressed - Marcus Mariota failed to gain any rhythm in the passing game, Drake London had a ball literally taken from his arms, and the reliable Younghoe Koo actually missed a kick. The Chargers meanwhile were able to do just enough, thanks to the leadership of Justin Herbert. As for the Rams, their offense is almost completely dysfunctional. It's frightening how a championship team last year could lose so much of its bite over the course of one offseason. Not only is it clear Matthew Stafford is breaking down, but this Detroit-style offense he's trying to nurse over there isn't jiving at all with the offensive roster.

The other lesson - add Andy Dalton to the list of quarterbacks who deserve to be on my shitlist for primetime games. No mas, Andy.

### Seahawks @ Buccaneers (-3)

***

##### _Streaks_

Seahawks - 4W  
Bucccaneers - 1W

Both teams are coming off morale-boosting victories, the Seahawks finishing a sweep on their rival Cardinals and the Buccaneers finally halting a losing skid last week with a last-second comeback against the Rams.

##### _Injuries_

Tampa Bay may have a few points of concern, but the only name worth watching here is Mike Evans. If Evans is out, Brady is down his best weapon.

For the Seahawks, it's worth keeping an eye on Marquise Goodwin.

##### _Weather_

Uneventful weather that shouldn't play much a role in deciding this game

##### _History_

No relevant recent history is there to explore between these two organization or their key coaches.

### Seahawks +3

***

How are the Buccaneers favored here? Why do oddsmakers have these Seahawks still slotted so low on their rankings?

Seattle has been playing fantastic this year on both sides of the ball. Nowhere was this more evident than last week in Arizona, when the Seahawks registered three touchdowns after Geno Smith threw a humiliating pick-six that would have likely sapped the morale of lesser teams on the road. This Seattle team has a winner's mindset absent in so many other teams this season, notably Tampa Bay. Sure, the Buccaneers won last week, but it was against an uninspiring Rams team that did virtually everything in its power to give that game away. These Seahawks put up a much more impressive performance against an Arizona team with more offensive potential.

I know Geno Smith has shown susceptibility to the blitz. Unfortunately for him, few people understand the intricacies of blitzing better than Todd Bowles, so expect some pressure to be mounted against Geno here. That being said, the McVay style of offense Seattle has adopted has seen resounding success against Tampa Bay over the past couple years. I know McVay's club lost last week against these Buccaneers, but one can argue that the reason Los Angeles wasn't able to escape with a victory last week is because they seem to have changed dramatically on offense - instead of being a quick-strike offense loaded with crossing concepts, the Rams are playing a much more traditional form of dropback football that's simply not working for them. Seattle, meanwhile, is running a carbon copy of the McVay offense that is serving them mighty well.

### Browns @ Dolphins (-3.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Browns - 1W (BYE)  
Dolphins - 3W

Dolphins have never lost once when Tua has been able to start and finish a game.

##### _Injuries_

No major injuries to document here

##### _Weather_

It's a hot one by November's standards

##### _History_

Neither of these two franchises nor their lead coaches have any recent history with one another.

***

### Dolphins -3.5

***

Cleveland is slightly overrated as they're returning from a bye week after having stomped out the Bengals in a primetime contest. The reality is that Cincinnati seems to harbor an inferiority complex against the Browns, so that game needs to be interpreted more as a fluke when evaluating Cleveland's real potential. If you look back a few weeks before that Cincinnati game, these Browns haven't really impressed. In fact, they were on a four-game losing skid. It's worth noting three of those losses came against teams that beat the last year as well - Cleveland hasn't really changed face much at all this year.

The Dolphins, on the other hand...those fish have a swagger to them. Maybe I'm overreacting a but here, but Miami has the most explosive offense in the league - no other offense has seen as much success as Miami's on an EPA basis. It makes sense given no other team boasts a receiving corps as flashy or as frightening as Miami's. Opposing defenses have yet to really adjust to all the play-action passing concepts Mike McDaniel has loaded into his playbook. I don't expect Cleveland's defensive coaches to devise an effective coverage scheme to limit Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle, so the Dolphins should have little issue dicing up their shoddy pass coverage.

The only problem here is the other side of things. Miami's defense hasn't really impressed so much against the pass themselves. But the good news here is that the Dolphins are quite adept limiting the rush, given opposing tailbacks have only found success against them on roughly 45% of their attempts. So that should play well against a Cleveland team that absolutely needs an effective ground game to win here.

### Lions @ Bears (-3)

***

##### _Streaks_

Lions - 1W  
Bears - 2L

Despite playing well against some solid teams over the past couple weeks, Chicago is on a losing streak.

##### _Injuries_

Not an injury, but Roquan Smith will be missed now that he's no longer being there to lead Chicago's linebacker corps.

##### _Weather_

Unfortunately for Jared Goff, the gales of November has arrived. While cold winds aren't really expected, temperatures are expected to be in the 30s.

##### _History_

Jared Goff and Justin Fields led their respective teams into battle against one another once last year, on Soldier Field. Chicago solidly won that game, even as three-point favorites. That being said, the coaching staffs for both organizations have changed considerably since then. Matt Nagy and his ilk have been ousted from Chicago. On the other side, Anthony Lynn's no longer in charge of the offense.

***

### Bears -3

***

It's a bit risky to ask an average team to win outright as field goal favorites, but Detroit's just not that good a team, last week's win notwithstanding. Their defense still ranks among the worst in the league even after being gifted multiple interceptions from Aaron Rodgers last week.

But what really wins me over to Chicago's side here is the cold weather. Reviewing his games over the past couple years, it's clear Jared Goff has issues operating in cold weather. It makes sense too considering Goff spent his childhood in California. I know, I know...quarterbacks born and raised in California have managed to play at all levels of the game without cold weather hindering them too much...but Goff genuinely lacks the inherent fortitude one needs to overcome some habituated aversions. I honestly doubt he's honed an appreciation for cold weather in his limited time with Detroit.

Reviewing photos from Detroit's outdoor practice, I haven't seen any photo of Jared Goff in action. A bit surprising, especially since it seems frigid weather has yet to really grace Michigan. But then again, this is Jared Goff.

Expect the Lions to be productive over ground anyway, especially given the state of Chicago's front-seven now that the team has traded away some of its brand name players. That being said, I don't think Detroit will be consistent here on offense, giving Chicago an opportunity to run up the score.

### Texans @ Giants (-4.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Texans - 3L  
Giants - 1L

Houston's coming off a decent performance on Thursday night against an Eagles team that arguably didn't really care to play.

##### _Injuries_

Brandin Cooks isn't definite to play this Sunday, though it appears he's trending towards playing.

As for the Giants, they'll be down a valuable player in Daniel Bellinger as he recuperates from a serious eye injury.

##### _Weather_

Unexpectedly nice weather for November

##### _History_

No real history between these two organizations. Brian Daboll and Lovie Smith have versed against one another last year, but Davis Mills was making his NFL debut in that game, so that game carries little weight in our analysis here.

***

### Giants -4.5

***

A tall spread, but the Giants are capable of covering this spread against a clearly pathetic Texans organization.
