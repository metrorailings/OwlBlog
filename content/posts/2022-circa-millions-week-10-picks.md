New rule - never pick teams that struggle to win if they're taking anything short of 4 points. I learned my lesson the hard way, seeing two of my selections result in pushes despite the team I favored playing so much better. But the reality is that Atlanta and Los Angeles are teams not currently built to win in adverse circumstances. In Atlanta's case, their team lost some of its swagger as the game progressed - Marcus Mariota failed to gain any rhythm in the passing game, Drake London had a ball literally taken from his arms, and the reliable Younghoe Koo actually missed a kick. The Chargers meanwhile were able to do just enough, thanks to the leadership of Justin Herbert. As for the Rams, their offense is almost completely dysfunctional. It's frightening how a championship team last year could lose so much of its bite over the course of one offseason. Not only is it clear Matthew Stafford is breaking down, but this Detroit-style offense he's trying to nurse over there isn't jiving at all with the offensive roster.

The other lesson - add Andy Dalton to the list of quarterbacks who deserve to be on my shitlist for primetime games. No mas, Andy.
