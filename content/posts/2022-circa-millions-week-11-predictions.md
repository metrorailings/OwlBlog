Interesting week.

Honestly, the Bears are way too sloppy to take as favorites going forward. Justin Fields can't be trusted to drop back and play as a passer when circumstances deem that the ground game needs to be abandoned. The sad thing is that if the reffing were a bit more objective, Chicago would have walked away with the win. But a few bad calls mixed in with some horrendous late-game mistakes cost them what should have been a solid victory. Then again, my handicapping of that game was wrong - I was fully expecting Jared Goff to play softer as the weather turned cold - instead, Jared Goff may have played some of the best football of his young career as a Lion. Which says quite a bit about Chicago's defense.

My other loss was Seattle. Why do I always end up violating my overseas cardinal rule at least once every season? I know better than to ever bet on an international game and yet I can't help myself. I guess the line was way too tempting - after all, temptation is usually the way the devil lures us into bad decisions. I never thought field conditions would frustrate the Seahawks so much. Neither did I see Tampa Bay committing more snaps to the run game. Once the run game was established, Brady and company used the play-action more to open up passing lanes towards the middle of the field. Credit to them for coming up with a fantastic game plan that completely threw Pete Carroll's defense off equilibrium.

So where do we stand here? First, we are going to start playing the numbers more here? We need to start evaluating the games by looking at the number first and determining whether that number is a fair assessment of the game given both of the teams involved as well as the location where they're playing. Then we go from there.

### Browns @ Bills (-9.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Browns - 1L  
Bills - 2L

Buffalo's reeling after two surprise losses.

##### _Injuries_

Josh Allen needs to be monitored through the week.

##### _Weather_

Snow is expected. Will the weather be so rough that the passing game will be stunted? We'll see

##### _History_

Oddly enough, these two organizations nor their coaches have met in recent games.

### Uncertain

***

I'm not sure. Does Buffalo deserve to be nearly double-digit favorites against Cleveland? They haven't been playing well enough to win the past couple weeks. But those games came against playoff-caliber teams with a winning mindset. Cleveland is **NOT** playoff bound this year. And the Browns have done precious little lately to show me they're mentally tough or even trending upward. If anything, the games this year have shown me very little has changed from last year.

Normally, this is a game Buffalo should dominate from start to finish. The Bills should win this game, but the question becomes whether Cleveland can stealthily cover this spread in garbage time. Judging by their last three games, the Bills have issues finishing games out with an exclamation point.

### Lions @ Giants (-3)

##### _Streaks_

Lions - 2W  
Giants - 1W

Detroit's coming off two straight upsets against division rivals.

##### _Injuries_

Nothing critical worthy of note on either side, although it's worth keeping an eye on Daniel Bellinger.

##### _Weather_

Cold weather expected of November

##### _History_

No history to explore here, tragically

***

### Uncertain

***

The Giants are too disciplined to lose to a mistake-prone Lions team. Granted, Jared Goff played pretty well, but that was against an uninspiring Chicago defense that lacks any real mojo. On top of that, not many of his passes traveled far. In fact, it was his receivers finding ways to generate yards after the catch that played a major role in their production. More importantly though, the Lions owe their win last week to some referee luck as well as Justin Fields being reliably sloppy in the passing game.

That being said, I'm a little concerned about the Giants and their offense. Their ground game hasn't been all that effective lately, at least when compared to their rushing performances from earlier in the season. Defenses have been keying in on stopping Saquon lately, if their last two games are any indication - I mean...Houston was able to limit New York's on over 55% of his rushes. If New York can't depend mostly on their tailbacks to carry the burden of production, that means more responsibility's forced on the shoulders of Daniel Jones and Darius Slayton.

So I'll need to revisit this one later in the week.

### Rams @ Saints (-4)

***

##### _Streaks_

Rams - 3L  
Saints - 1W

The Rams are not having any fun this season. It's not far-fetched to say they might be one of the worst teams in the league.

##### _Injuries_

Not only is Matthew Stafford expected to be out again as he recovers from a serious brain injury, but Cooper Kupp is out for the next couple weeks with an ankle sprain. This Rams team is in a grave situation.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

Oddly enough, these two teams haven't squared off against one another since 2019. So there's no recent data to examine here.

***

### Saints -4

***

It's a bit odd. The Saints aren't a good team by any means. The last couple weeks alone have shown me that Andy Dalton is nothing more than a placeholder quarterback. Their defense has also been suspect as of late, particularly against opposing rushers. So to see them be considered 4-point favorites here, one would think I'd rather be siding with the underdog here.

But the Rams are a hot mess. An absolute hot mess. The heart and soul of their offense will no longer be there now that he's dealing with an injury expected to sideline him for weeks. Matthew Stafford will likely remain out given the severity of his concussion, meaning John Wolford and Bryce Perkins will forced to handle the reins on offense. It's pretty unclear neither one of them are quite ready for the professional leagues...although I remember writing off PJ Walker in the same way after his depressing outing against these same Rams about a month ago.

If the Rams play as ugly as they did last Sunday, a Saints cover is assured here. But I'm afraid Los Angeles will pull out all the tricks here to try and steal a win here on the road. And you know what? They could win this one here if they string together enough scoring drives through a combination of gimmick plays and surprising quarterback play.

Then again, Carolina made money the past couple weeks by leaning on its running game. Los Angeles can't quite do that now, can they?

### Jets @ Patriots (-3.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Jets - 1W (BYE)  
Patriots - 2W (BYE)

Both teams are returning from the bye on a winning streak.

##### _Injuries_

Sheldon Rankins will be out for several weeks, perhaps hurting their rushing defense.

##### _Weather_

It's going to be a cold one

##### _History_

It seems probable to me that the Jets have an inferiority complex against these Patriots. Belichick has dominated every single one of their meetings so far in the Robert Saleh era.

New York came pretty close a few weeks ago, but the team ultimately collapsed once New England started running away with the lead. 

***

### Patriots -3.5

***

In normal circumstances, the Patriots wouldn't merit such a wide spread against a good team. But the game between these two clubs a few weeks ago shows me that the Jets have issues finding the mental fortitude to overcome that "little brother" vibe holding them back. That mental block by itself should damn them in this contest.

On top of that, a good defensive mind should know the proper way to frustrate New York on offense is to limit their production on the ground game. The Patriots were able to do exactly that in their first go-around. I don't see why things would be any different this time around, though Mike LaFleur could finally impress me by manufacturing production through a game plan incorporating a whole bunch of tactics that the Patriots were not expecting at all. Then again, even with a solid game plan, can Zack Wilson steel himself long enough to follow through and lead his team to a victory on enemy territory?

### Raiders @ Broncos (-3)

***

##### _Streaks_

Raiders - 3L  
Broncos - 1L

The Raiders are coming off their most embarrassing performance of the season, losing against a bottom-tier team led by a coach with absolutely no professional experience.

##### _Injuries_

Hunter Renfrow and Darren Waller have slid down into injured reserve, meaning the Raiders now definitively have only two certified weapons on offense - Davonte Adams and Josh Jacobs.

Denver seems to be missing some pieces along the interior of their offensive line. Jerry Jeudy is the bigger concern here. His practice schedule has to be monitored.

##### _Weather_

Cool weather

##### _History_

Last time these two met in Las Vegas, the Raiders were able to power their way to a win by relying on Josh Jacobs to assume the mantle of production. Davonte Adams making catches in key moments also helped, but it was a great performance from Jacobs that helped Vegas find their first win of the season.

***

### Broncos -3

***

The Raiders are a bad team overall. It's clear their defense lacks any real passion or heart. Nowhere was that more evident than the play last week where the defense allowed Matt Ryan to scramble for 38 yards.

Can they turn things around? Sure, but it'll be hard for such a limited offense to gain traction against one of the league's toughest defenses. Last time these two played, Denver surrendered way too many yards rushing to Vegas. Given their rushing defense numbers over the season, I'm going to assume that was a fluky result from a defense that was likely caught off-guard from a Raiders team looking desperately for a winning identity on offense. I don't see Josh Jacobs putting up big numbers again, especially in Denver.

I do expect the Raiders defense to play better than last week, and it'll be easier to do so too considering Russell Wilson's offense ranks as one of the most pathetic in the league. But if the Broncos defense affords Wilson enough opportunities, I do expect him to post up points against this soft Vegas defense, no matter how hard they try holding out this time to make up for their lack of effort last week.

### Cowboys @ Vikings (+1.5)

##### _Streaks_

Packers - 1L  
Vikings - 7W

The Cowboys are coming off a loss against Green Bay. Granted, the Packers were desperate for  

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

Last year, the Cowboys and Vikings faced off in primetime. I remember that match quite well, as I picked Minnesota in the contest here. I mean...Cooper Rush was starting for Dallas. How could a quarterback who's never called a single snap in regulation succeed on the road against Mike Zimmer's defense? I was wrong. Horribly wrong. Cooper Rush and Kellen Moore were able to thatch together enough plays and score just enough to win in a game where nobody was giving them a chance.

***

### Vikings +1.5

***

Even though history would favor Dallas here, their win in Minnesota last year came against a Viking team trending downward into irrelevance under Mike Zimmer. The Vikings this year is very different though. In fact, consider this - the Vikings of 2021 successfully staged 5 major comebacks while surrendering significant leads in 4 other games. This year's Vikings already staged nearly as many comebacks without surrendering a significant lead in a single game. It's pretty clear the locker room has been given renewed life under the new regime.

On top of that, this defense has been transformed under new coordinator Ed Donatell. No longer does the unit rank near the bottom in so many categories. Most importantly, they went from being one of the worser run defenses to being average. I know, I know, that doesn't sound so impressive given some regression was expected...but it's worth noting Minnesota's been much better slowing down opposing rushers as of lately - they've forced four of their past five opponents to perform worse relative to expectations. All this indicates Dallas is going to struggle getting the ground game going. And if that's the case, I don't think Dak has the mental strength to carry the team against a good opponent.
