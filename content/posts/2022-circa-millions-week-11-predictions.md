Interesting week.

Honestly, the Bears are way too sloppy to take as favorites going forward. Justin Fields can't be trusted to drop back and play as a passer when circumstances deem that the ground game needs to be abandoned. The sad thing is that if the reffing were a bit more objective, Chicago would have walked away with the win. But a few bad calls mixed in with some horrendous late-game mistakes cost them what should have been a solid victory. Then again, my handicapping of that game was wrong - I was fully expecting Jared Goff to play softer as the weather turned cold - instead, Jared Goff may have played some of the best football of his young career as a Lion. Which says quite a bit about Chicago's defense.

My other loss was Seattle. Why do I always end up violating my overseas cardinal rule at least once every season? I know better than to ever bet on an international game and yet I can't help myself. I guess the line was way too tempting - after all, temptation is usually the way the devil lures us into bad decisions. I never thought field conditions would frustrate the Seahawks so much. Neither did I see Tampa Bay committing more snaps to the run game. Once the run game was established, Brady and company used the play-action more to open up passing lanes towards the middle of the field. Credit to them for coming up with a fantastic game plan that completely threw Pete Carroll's defense off equilibrium.

So where do we stand here? First, we are going to start playing the numbers more here? We need to start evaluating the games by looking at the number first and determining whether that number is a fair assessment of the game given both of the teams involved as well as the location where they're playing. Then we go from there.

I'm not sure. Does Buffalo deserve to be nearly double-digit favorites against Cleveland? They haven't been playing well enough to win the past couple weeks. But those games came against playoff-caliber teams with a winning mindset. Cleveland is **NOT** playoff bound this year. And the Browns have done precious little lately to show me they're mentally tough or even trending upward. If anything, the games this year have shown me very little has changed from last year.

Normally, this is a game Buffalo should dominate from start to finish. The Bills should win this game, but the question becomes whether Cleveland can stealthily cover this spread in garbage time. Judging by their last three games, the Bills have issues finishing games out with an exclamation point.
