Interesting week.

Honestly, the Bears are way too sloppy to take as favorites going forward. Justin Fields can't be trusted to drop back and play as a passer when circumstances deem that the ground game needs to be abandoned. The sad thing is that if the reffing were a bit more objective, Chicago would have walked away with the win. But a few bad calls mixed in with some horrendous late-game mistakes cost them what should have been a solid victory. Then again, my handicapping of that game was wrong - I was fully expecting Jared Goff to play softer as the weather turned cold - instead, Jared Goff may have played some of the best football of his young career as a Lion. Which says quite a bit about Chicago's defense.

My other loss was Seattle. Why do I always end up violating a cardinal rule at least once every season, to never bet on an overseas football game? I guess the line was way too tempting. I never thought field conditions would frustrate the Seahawks so much. Neither did I see Tampa Bay committing more snaps to the run game. Once the run game was established, Brady and company used the play-action more to open up passing lanes towards the middle of the field. Credit to them for coming up with a fantastic game plan that completely threw Pete Carroll's defense off equilibrium.

So where do we stand here? First, we are going to start playing the numbers more here? We need to start evaluating the games by looking at the number first and determining whether that number is a fair assessment of the game given both of the teams involved as well as the location where they're playing. Then we go from there.
