Interesting week.

Honestly, the Bears are way too sloppy to take as favorites going forward. Justin Fields can't be trusted to drop back and play as a passer when circumstances deem that the ground game needs to be abandoned. The sad thing is that if the reffing were a bit more objective, Chicago would have walked away with the win. But a few bad calls mixed in with some horrendous late-game mistakes cost them what should have been a solid victory. Then again, my handicapping of that game was wrong - I was fully expecting Jared Goff to play softer as the weather turned cold - instead, Jared Goff may have played some of the best football of his young career as a Lion. Which says quite a bit about Chicago's defense.

My other loss was Seattle. Why do I always end up violating a cardinal rule at least once every season, to never bet on an overseas football game? I guess the line was way too tempting. I never thought field conditions would frustrate the Seahawks so much. Neither did I see Tampa Bay committing more snaps to the run game. Once the run game was established, Brady and company used the play-action more to open up passing lanes towards the middle of the field. Credit to them for coming up with a fantastic game plan that completely threw Pete Carroll's defense off equilibrium.
