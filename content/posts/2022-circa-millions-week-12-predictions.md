Interesting week. Honestly, the Bears are way too sloppy to take as favorites going forward. Justin Fields can't be trusted to drop back and play as a passer when circumstances deem it necessary. The sad thing is that if the reffing was a bit more objective, Chicago would have walked away with the win. But a few bad calls mixed in with some horrendous late-game mistakes cost them what should have been a solid victory. Then again, my handicapping of that game was wrong - I was fully expecting Jared Goff to play softer as the weather turned cold - instead, Jared Goff may have played some of the best football of his young career as a Lion.
