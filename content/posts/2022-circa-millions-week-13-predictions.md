+++
Last week was interesting. Several things....

First, my theory that teams coming off emotional wins against perceivably better competition has some weight. The Lions not only won, but blew out the Jaguars, not punting or turning the ball over once. It was a statement win against a team many analysts still see as one of the better teams in the league.

Second, the inferiority complex theory carries some weight - Tampa Bay failed to cover the spread against New Orleans despite covering the latter not doing much offensively. Now Tom Brady did manage to lead his men back on a last-second comeback, but this spread was in the bag once the Saints scored a field goal early in the fourth quarter. Another example worth noting here...the Bears blew the cover against their big brother Packers despite being in pole position for much of the game. It was a pretty embarrassing choke too - all things considered, the nature of the loss signified to me that Chicago as an organization has issues competing against the Packers. I suspect it's likely because Aaron Rodgers has schooled this franchise in 13 of their last 14 meetings. Which would probably explain why Rodgers boasted about how beating the Bears is like wearing a worn sweater to him.

Third, I shouldn't select teams billed as heavy favorites unless those teams rank among the best in the league, which means only a handful of teams should be considered worthy of a bet should they be giving away a boatload of points on the road. The Seahawks are not one of those teams. It was more than evident two weeks ago when they surrendered over 250 yards to Josh Jacobs by himself.

Fourth, I really should be more wary of drawing comparisons between teams using games from last year when the coaching staff for any one of those teams has been shaken up significantly this year. While the Ravens stomped out Denver last year, the same wouldn't have happened this year even if Lamar managed to survive through all four quarters. It's clear these Ravens aren't built to handle the speed of this revamped Bronco defense under Ejiro Evero - few teams are. It was only through the ineptitude of Denver's offense as well as Tyler Hundley's innate toughness that Baltimore was able to barely escape the contest with a win.

I think I covered everything. So let's go...

### Jets @ Bills (-9.5)

##### _Recent History_

\**Jets  
\**vs. Bears (W)  
@ Vikings (L)

**Bills**  
@ Lions (W) \[Thanksgiving\]  
@ Patriots (W) \[TNF\]

Oh lord, the Bills are returning home after a very successful extended road trip over the past couple weeks. This will be a good opportunity to test the flimsiness of my theory about extended road trips.

##### _Injuries_

Neither side so far has any injuries that I would deem serious.

##### _Weather_

Quite cold and some snow is expected. Expect a slushy affair now that we're well into December.

##### _Prior Meetings_

The Jets won the first match earlier in the season despite being stamped as double-digit underdogs against Buffalo at home. Keep in mind Zach Wilson was still the quarterback for New York at the time. Now Michael White is the quarterback. HIs ascendance seems to have rejuvenated this team a bit, especially on offense.

***

### Jets +9.5

***

I know the oddsmakers are showing a bit more respect towards the Jets now that New York is catching fewer points on the road than they were given at home just several weeks ago...but this spread is still too egregious, no? New York is a good team, especially now that Mike White's made this offense operate at a serviceable level. I understand New York is still limited at offensive weaponry, but let's not pretend that same limitation doesn't apply to the Bills - nobody outside of Stefon Diggs has been reliable enough to produce on offense, suspiciously enough.

That being said, I'm well aware game script can lead to the Jets losing control of the pace here. If the Bills start dictating the script by running up the script, it's all but over. But 9.5 points is still too much when Buffalo itself is far from a finished product.

One thing worth noting here is that I have yet another opportunity to test my theory about teams being a bit lazier than normal when facing an underdog after coming off a successful multi-week road trip.

### Ravens @ Steelers (-2.5)

##### _Recent History_

**Ravens**  
@ Jaguars (L)

**Steelers**  
@ Colts (W)  
@ Falcons (W)

Pittsburgh is coming off two major road wins, which concerns me here.

##### _Injuries_

Baltimore may not only have Lamar Jackson suited up for this game, but they may also be down their best tackler on defense in Patrick Queen.

##### _Weather_

It's going to be a cold outing, with some rain expected.

##### _Prior Meetings_

Going back to 2020, Pittsburgh has won all their contests against Baltimore, albeit with slim margins. The biggest win was only by 5 points.

***

### Steelers -2.5

***

It's not easy siding with any one team here, knowing how tight matches between these two tend to be. But Pittsburgh has gotten the better of Baltimore in their past four contests. I don't see much changing considering Baltimore this year is not any better than their 2020 or 2021 versions. Pittsburgh isn't much better either, but they've shown promise over the past month.

That being said, it seems the Steelers are real productive once their ground game finds rhythm, which won't be easy to pull off against a Baltimore defense that's emerged in recent weeks as one of the more stouter units against opposing rushers. Even though their overall success rate this year only has them rated as a middling rush defense, the past several weeks has shown me they've been improving on an accelerating trajectory.

I'm still siding with Pittsburgh here, hoping that a slight inferiority complex will be enough to swamp Baltimore's team here and give Mike Tomlin and his men just enough juice to nab victory here.

It's worth noting that the Steelers are also coming off two straight wins on the road trip, so a lazier performance from them is certainly possible, especially now that Baltimore has to resort to its second-string quarterback.

### Browns @ Bengals (-6.5)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Browns**  
vs. Buccaneers (W)  
@ Texans (W)

**Steelers**  
@ Titans (W)  
vs. Chiefs (W)

##### _Injuries_

Bengals will be missing the services of their main tight end in Hayden Hurst.

##### _Weather_

Not that bad considering we're in the middle of December.

##### _Prior Meetings_

The Bengals seem to harbor an inferiority complex against the Browns - Cincinnati has a habit of losing big to Cleveland.

***

### Uncertain

***

Normally, the presence of an inferiority complex here would make things easy, but the problem is that Cleveland is starting a quarterback that hasn't played the game in nearly two years. Going by last week's tape, it's abundantly clear Deshaun Watson needs time to adjust back to the game. How much time exactly, that I don't know. But until he rediscovers his form, the Brown passing offense will be good as worthless.

Nick Chubb will chew off some serious yards in this game. But a ground game without any real semblance of a passing offense can only do so much. Until Watson shows me that he can quarterback at a proficient level, I'll be wary of taking Cleveland going forward.

### Jaguars @ Titans (-3.5)

##### _Recent History_

**Jaguars**  
vs. Ravens (W)  
@ Lions (L)

**Titans**  
vs. Bengals (L)  
@ Eagles (L)

##### _Injuries_

It's almost guaranteed Treyvon Burk will be missing in action here.

It's worth keeping an eye on Denico Autry for the Titans.

##### _Weather_

Little chilly with some humidity

##### _Prior Meetings_

The Titans swept the Jaguars with little effort last year. But those results only hold so much weight now that a new coaching regime is in place over in Jacksonville.

***

### Uncertain

***

This game is a great look into what matters more - coaching or talent. Only one organization is loaded with talent, but the other team in the contest has far better coaching with a proven track record. So who wins here? I'm not too sure.

But the one thing I can say is that this spread seems a tad too high in favor of the Titans, especially given their recent struggles on offense. With their best receiver sidelined and their hallmark rushing attack missing some teeth, it's almost impossible for me to envision Tennessee running up the score here. The only way they can pull off such a feat is if their defense can completely stonewall Jacksonville to the point of impotency.

The sad thing is that's certainly possible, especially given how badly the Jaguars are coached on offense. Their gusto for fourth down attempts makes no sense given how many times they've failed to convert - it's almost as if Doug Pederson forgot to draw up fourth down plays before printing out his playbook.

If I had to pick a side here, it'd be Jacksonville. But I'd be calling myself a damn fool for even making a pick here.

Denver is coming off two straight road losses.

##### _Injuries_

None worth noting so far, though we'll keep an eye on the injury report come Friday.

##### _Weather_

Chilly

##### _Prior Meetings_

Last year when these two met at Mile High Stadium, the Broncos actually kept this game very competitive until the end. Once again, as I noted earlier, that game can only carry so much weight given a new coaching regime has been installed in Denver. On top of that, the quarterback situation over there is just...tragic.

***

### Uncertain

***

This Denver club is in shambles on offense. It's clear things aren't getting better and that Russell Wilson is showing frighteningly little signs of improvement. Given what I heard about him lately, it appears he refuses to be coached too. So this offense is dead.

For Denver to nail this cover, their defense has to play out of its mind for four quarters straight. Now I know the Chiefs offensive line isn't as impressive as some out there think...but Patrick Mahomes has been playing at an elite level for much of this season. You can only do so much before somebody like him finally wills his way towards points.

Then again...I'm thinking back to that Tennessee game. The Titans were able to frustrate Kansas on offense, though they had to effectively play a double-header on defense to keep the game within reach at the end. Can Denver pull off that same feat? Even if the Broncos let up a bit towards the end, would that afford the Chiefs enough time to run up a double-digit lead here?

##### _Weather_

Dome

##### _Prior Meetings_

No real recent history worth exploring here.

***

### Dolphins -3.5

***

Yes, the Chargers have one of the best quarterbacks in the league in Justin Herbert. But when you saddle that quarterback with terrible coaching, lame skill players, a shoddy offensive line, an incompetent run defense, and a flaccid pass rush....he's being set up to fail. And that's exactly what we saw last week when the Chargers lost in Vegas.

The good news though is that Keenan Allen and Mike Williams are expected to return back in better health. If they can contribute through the game, Herbert might have the barebones supporting cast he needs to keep this contest in contention.

But the Dolphins are just so incredibly explosive and versatile on offense. This is the exact type of offense that usually ends up exploiting the biggest weakness in the Charger defense - their inability to cap explosive plays. Then again, it's not like the Dolphins are so sterling themselves on defense, especially given their proclivity for the blitz. These blitz-heavy defenses are usually easy pickings too for top-flight quarterbacks like Justin Herbert.

In the end, it's said that teams that cover the spread manage to win the game roughly 80% of the time. Good cases can be made for either side here, though Miami has more factors in its favor.

BYE

##### _Injuries_

A few skill players and defensive backs are injured for the Patriots, but I suspect most (if not all) will end up playing this Monday.

Rondale Moore and DeAndre Hopkins are both names worth watching. Hopkins is likely to play, but Moore isn't.
