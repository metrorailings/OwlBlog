So in the end, did my theory about teams on extended road trips pan out? Eh, I'm not sure.

Washington did impress me against Atlanta, starting with their opening drive. I didn't notice any slowdown whatsoever from them. With precious few exceptions, the Commanders were able to achieve what they set out to do on offense. Defensively, they were the more forceful unit compared to their counterparts on the other side.

Cleveland ended up winning as home underdogs against Tampa Bay, but even that win came on a last-second play towards the end of regulation to force overtime. After the initial scripted plays, Cleveland's offense failed to score any points until the very end of the fourth quarter. To be fair, their defense stepped up and did tremendous work limiting Brady and his men at critical moments - Tampa Bay's offense failed to find much success on offense.
