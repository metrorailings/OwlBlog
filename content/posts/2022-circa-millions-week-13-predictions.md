Last week was interesting. Several things....

First, my theory that teams coming off emotional wins against perceivably better competition has some weight. The Lions not only won, but blew out the Jaguars, not punting or turning the ball over once. It was a statement win against a team many analysts still see as one of the better teams in the league. 

Second, the inferiority complex theory carries some weight - Tampa Bay failed to cover the spread against New Orleans despite covering the latter not doing much offensively. Now Tom Brady did manage to lead his men back on a last-second comeback, but this spread was in the bag once the Saints scored a field goal early in the fourth quarter. More importantly, the Bears blew the cover against their big brother Packers despite being in pole position for much of the game. It was a pretty embarrassing choke too - all things considered, the nature of the loss signified to me that Chicago as an organization has issues competing against the Packers. I suspect it's likely because Aaron Rodgers has schooled this franchise in 13 of their last 14 meetings. Which would probably explain why Rodgers boasted about how he's grown so comfortable beating the Bears since time immemorial.

Third, I shouldn't select teams billed as heavy favorites unless those teams rank among the best in the league, which means only a handful of teams should be considered worthy of a bet should they be giving away a boatload of points on the road.  

Fourth, I really should be more wary of drawing comparisons between teams when the coaching staff for any one of those teams has been shaken up significantly. While the Ravens stomped out Denver last year, the same wouldn't have happened this year even if Lamar managed to survive through all four quarters. It's clear these Ravens aren't built to handle the speed of the Bronco defense - it was only through some luck and the Tyler Hundley's innate toughness that Baltimore was able to barely escape the contest with a win.
