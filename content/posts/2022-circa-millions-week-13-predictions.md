Last week was interesting. Several things....

First, my theory that teams coming off emotional wins against perceivably better competition has some weight. The Lions not only won, but blew out the Jaguars, not punting or turning the ball over once. It was a statement win against a team many analysts still see as one of the better teams in the league. 

Second, the inferiority complex theory carries some weight - Tampa Bay failed to cover the spread against New Orleans despite covering the latter not doing much offensively. Now Tom Brady did manage to lead his men back on a last-second comeback, but this spread was in the bag once the Saints scored a field goal early in the fourth quarter.

Third, I shouldn't select teams billed as heavy favorites unless those teams rank among the best in the league, which means only a handful of teams should be considered worthy of a bet should they be giving away a boatload of points on the road.
