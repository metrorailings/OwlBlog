Last week was interesting. Several things....

First, my theory that teams coming off emotional wins against perceivably better competition has some weight. The Lions not only won, but blew out the Jaguars, not punting or turning the ball over once. It was a statement win against a team many analysts still see as one of the better teams in the league. 

Second, the inferiority complex theory carries some weight - Tampa Bay failed to cover the spread against New Orleans despite covering the latter not doing much offensively. Now Tom Brady did manage to lead his men back on a last-second comeback, but this spread was in the bag once the Saints scored a field goal early in the fourth quarter. Another example worth noting here...the Bears blew the cover against their big brother Packers despite being in pole position for much of the game. It was a pretty embarrassing choke too - all things considered, the nature of the loss signified to me that Chicago as an organization has issues competing against the Packers. I suspect it's likely because Aaron Rodgers has schooled this franchise in 13 of their last 14 meetings. Which would probably explain why Rodgers boasted about how beating the Bears is like wearing a worn sweater to him.

Third, I shouldn't select teams billed as heavy favorites unless those teams rank among the best in the league, which means only a handful of teams should be considered worthy of a bet should they be giving away a boatload of points on the road. The Seahawks are not one of those teams. It was more than evident two weeks ago when they surrendered over 250 yards to Josh Jacobs by himself.

Fourth, I really should be more wary of drawing comparisons between teams using games from last year when the coaching staff for any one of those teams has been shaken up significantly this year. While the Ravens stomped out Denver last year, the same wouldn't have happened this year even if Lamar managed to survive through all four quarters. It's clear these Ravens aren't built to handle the speed of this revamped Bronco defense under Ejiro Evero - few teams are. It was only through the ineptitude of Denver's offense as well as Tyler Hundley's innate toughness that Baltimore was able to barely escape the contest with a win.

I think I covered everything. So let's go...
