Not bad ultimately. I wish I took more chances last week on spreads I saw as very risky, like the Jaguars taking 3.5 points against the Titans and the 49ers giving away 3.5 points to a Buccaneer team coming off a last-minute comeback victory against a hated division rival. Injuries ultimately scared me away from those games, but I have to constantly remind myself to analyze those injuries more in depth to see if they're serious enough to keep key players sidelined. Trevor Lawrence played despite a bad toe and Nick Bosa suited up regardless of the litany of issues preventing him from practicing last week.

A few things - an inferiority complex can be overcome if the other team is dealing with a liability at quarterback. Despite his resume of work with the Texans, Deshaun Watson is a liability as he struggles to get back into rhythm after spending two years away from football. Also, Arizona is genuinely a bad team. I mean, that team is just awful. I used to respect Kliff Kingsbury too after his work last week keeping the Cardinals on a winning streak despite that massive albatross weighing them down at quarterback. But even with Colt McCoy playing in a few games, the Cardinals still lack any swagger on offense. DeAndre Hopkins, with all his talent, has done little to energize the unit. Other skill players haven't made much impact. Defensively, the unit punches below its weight. They should be better, especially in the pas rush. But Chandler Jones leaving has left a hole on the edge that Markus Golden and other players down the depth chart haven't quite filled.

That being said, my thesis was that Kyler Murray would produce yards on offense by running laps around the Patriot defenders. That thesis couldn't be tested as Murray blew out his knee on the third play of the game. With Colt McCoy in there managing the offense, Arizona had to resort to a far more traditional game plan highlighting Colt as a dropback passer. It's a game plan that was bound to fail given the fragility of the offensive line.

Anyway, here we go.

##### Recent History

**Chiefs**

**Texans**  
vs. Browns (L)  
@ Cowboys (L)

Houston nearly won against Dallas last week despite being 17-point underdogs. Maybe this Houston team is better than we thought?

##### Injuries

No injuries of real significance for the Chiefs. The Texans may well be missing their best offensive player in Dameon Pierce after he was caught limping around last week during the game.

##### Weather

Pretty good weather

##### Prior Meetings

No recent history to explore between these two organizations or their coaching staffs.

### Texans +14

***

I don't know if I fully buy into the Texans here, but the fact that we're seeing a 50% difference between the ticket count and the money bet in Houston's favor is enough to merit me selecting them this week. If last week is any indication, it's clear this team thrives on being billed as significant underdogs.

Kansas has a habit of not blowing out opponents that should be blown out. But then again, the Chiefs last week were shelling the Broncos pretty heavily in the first half before dying down in the second half, leaving the window open for Denver to try and stage a comeback. I need to watch the game to see if Kansas intently slowed down in the second half after building a sizable lead. Either way, it's clear the Texans will be fighting hard here, even if this ends up being another losing battle for them.

Dome game

##### Prior Meetings

These two teams danced two years, but the Colts were being led by a different head coach and a quarterback at the time. Likewise, Mike Zimmer and his coaching regime were still in power over there in Minnesota. So that game is essentially meaningless when analyzing this game.

***

### Vikings -4.5

***

The Colts have been playing pretty demoralized lately after choking away what would have been a signature win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Since then, they've lost pretty badly against an uninspiring Pittsburgh outfit at home before getting rolled by a Dallas team playing such lackadaisical football at the time. It's not that the effort isn't there, but the fortitude to overcome negative game script is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Minnesota has been winning games by minimizing mistakes and making timely plays. Even if they don't flash at all on film, it's clear the Vikings are playing a sound brand of football focused simply on winning through discipline and game management.

Despite the end score, Minnesota's game last week against the Lions was pretty close, all things considered. Their defense rang up some timely stops, their offense was steadily able to move the ball, and Detroit was never able to force the game out of reach until the very end. It appeared to me that the Vikings mainly lost because their defensive coaching staff seriously underestimated Jared Goff's ability to pass - Goff had a field day flinging the rock all over the place and connecting with several different receivers.

4\.5 points is not too wide a spread for Minnesota to cover here, even if they've never demonstrated an ability to run up the score against anybody this season. Indianapolis will make a number of critical mistakes and the Vikings should be able to push up the score once (not if) the Colts start committing these errors.

##### Injuries

Miami might be down their starting tailback in Jeff Wilson.

Matt Milano hasn't been practicing at all this week, but things are trending towards him starting at least.

##### Weather

Expect freezing weather with some slight chance of precipitation

##### Prior Meetings

Back when these two met earlier, Buffalo proved themselves the better team but still lost. It was a bizarre loss too, considering the Bills possessed the ball for over 40-something minutes. Perhaps Miami benefitted from some luck and the element of surprise that came with new head coach Mike McDaniel installing a system of offense that was unfamiliar to defensive coaches around the league.

***

### Bills -7

***

The Bills are the better team in this match, especially now that Miami has been decoded on offense. I trust Sean McDermott will follow DeMeco Ryans and Brandon Staley in crowding the intermediate area of the field between the hashes with coverage defenders, thereby forcing Tua to throw away from his comfort zone. Whether Tagovailoa is capable of doing that remains to be seen, though I didn't see him really adjusting at all last week against the Chargers when it was abundantly clear that Los Angeles was going to make a living defending that one region of the field.

I do think McDaniel will commit to running the ball more, especially given the Bills are known to surrender explosive runs at a higher rate than normal. But Miami themselves haven't really shown any dedication to their ground game this season, so to think they could sustain success running the ball is a gamble, especially when the Bills are one of the better teams at forcing negative runs. The Dolphins were only able to steadily run the ball this year in their game against Cleveland, but that's not saying much, is it?

Emotionally, both teams need this win. Miami's returning back from its California mission beaten down physically and mentally. Buffalo is looking to lock down that top seed and avenge a painful loss to these same Dolphins from earlier in the season. On top of that, Buffalo will be playing in front of their beloved home crowd in primetime. So it'd be silly to expect Buffalo to take their foot off the accelerator should they rack up a multiple-score lead. If Miami is to cover this spread, it has to do so by force of will.

For the Steelers, Pat Friermuth and Diontae Johnson haven't been practicing. The bigger issue is Kenny Pickett though. Pickett is almost assured to be ruled out of the game with a concussion.

### Panthers -2.5

***

Carolina's a bit of a strange team. Their season-wide rushing numbers aren't too flattering, but if you look at their last several games, you'll see the Panthers have been outstanding shutting down opposing runners. Their only stumble over that period came against Cincinnati - Joe Mixon had a career outing that day. But honestly, I'm not sure that game was nothing more than a fluky result given the team's mental state at the time.

I bring up their rushing defense because it's well-known that the Steelers only succeed on offense so long as their ground game is brewing. Baltimore was down to their third-string quarterback, and yet they still won pretty soundly because Pittsburgh couldn't find any rhythm on the ground. These Panthers have the horses to limit Najee Harris, if their recent rushing defense numbers are any indication. If Carolina can force Pittsburgh's offense to play away from their strengths, a Panther victory is likely then. The magnitude of that win is uncertain given the sorry state of Carolina's passing game, but given the short spread, all they need to cover is to win.

### Titans @ Chargers (-3)

***

##### Recent History

**Titans**  
@ Eagles (L)  
vs. Jaguars (L)

**Chargers**  
@ Raiders (L)  
vs. Dolphins (W) \[SNF\]

The Titans are on an extended losing streak for the first time in Mike Vrabel's career as head coach. It's pretty amazing to see a team as solidly coached as Tennessee be currently mired in a three-game losing streak, but their talent deficiency has finally caught up with them.

##### Injuries

These Tennessee Titans are the walking wounded. Their top wide receiver, top cornerback, top linebackers, and top defensive pass rushers are all injured. The good news is that Denico Autry and Jeffery Simmons may play in some fashion, so at least their defensive front will have some pop to it come Sunday.

The Chargers are in comparatively better shape, as Sebastian Joseph-Day is expected to return. Lord knows the interior of that defensive front needs his presence.

##### Weather

Dome game

##### Prior Meetings

Neither of these two teams nor their main coaches are too familiar with one another. It's worth noting that against other Fangio-style defenses, Tennessee's offense hasn't really impressed statistically. But those games ultimately ended in victories, largely because their opponent's offenses were constantly shooting themselves in the foot.

***

### Titans +3

***

I wish Tennessee had the benefit of the hook here. It'd make me feel so much better siding with them if that were the case. That being said, I'm taking Tennessee here because  of a few reasons.

First, I see an emotional gulf here, considering Los Angeles is coming off a statement win against the hyped Dolphins while Tennessee has lost some face after the Jaguars blew them out last week in their own home stadium.

Second, Tennessee's clearly committed to running this ball with power. And as Vegas showed us just a few weeks ago, the Chargers aren't built to snuff gritty rushers like Josh Jacobs or Derrick Henry.

Third, even though the Titans have one of the worst pass protection units in the league, it should be easier keeping Ryan Tannehill upright against a Charger team not known for being able to pressure quarterbacks.

It's these combination of factors that should not only help Tennessee cover this spread, but perhaps steal a win here as an underdog.

A little worrying here to be a Bengals supporter here, considering they're traveling on the road after winning two games consecutively at home.

##### Injuries

Cincinnati is expected to miss one of Tyler Boyd and Tee Higgins.

Tampa might be missing a few people on defense, most notably Vita Vea. Joe Tryon-Shoyinka's dealing with a hip issue too.
