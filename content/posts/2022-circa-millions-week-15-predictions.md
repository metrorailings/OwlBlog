Not bad ultimately. I wish I took more chances last week on spreads I saw as very risky, like the Jaguars taking 3.5 points against the Titans and the 49ers giving away 3.5 points to a Buccaneer team coming off a last-minute comeback victory against a hated division rival. Injuries ultimately scared me away from those games, but I have to constantly remind myself to analyze those injuries more in depth to see if they're serious enough to keep key players sidelined. Trevor Lawrence played despite a bad toe and Nick Bosa suited up regardless of the litany of issues preventing him from practicing last week.

A few things - an inferiority complex can be overcome if the other team is dealing with a liability at quarterback. Despite his resume of work with the Texans, Deshaun Watson is a liability as he struggles to get back into rhythm after spending two years away from football. Also, Arizona is genuinely a bad team. I mean, that team is just awful. I used to respect Kliff Kingsbury too after his work last week keeping the Cardinals on a winning streak despite that massive albatross weighing them down at quarterback. But even with Colt McCoy playing in a few games, the Cardinals still lack any swagger on offense. DeAndre Hopkins, with all his talent, has done little to energize the unit. Other skill players haven't made much impact. Defensively, the unit punches below its weight. They should be better, especially in the pas rush. But Chandler Jones leaving has left a hole on the edge that Markus Golden and other players down the depth chart haven't quite filled.

That being said, my thesis was that Kyler Murray would produce yards on offense by running laps around the Patriot defenders. That thesis couldn't be tested as Murray blew out his knee on the third play of the game. With Colt McCoy in there managing the offense, Arizona had to resort to a far more traditional game plan highlighting Colt as a dropback passer. It's a game plan that was bound to fail given the fragility of the offensive line.

Anyway, here we go.
