So the lessons I learned last week will inform me going forward. Football is a game that goes far beyond simple statistics and recent performances. Which teams cover the spread week in and week out is more a game of psychology than strategy. A game involving emotional highs and lows, inferiority complexes, strategic adaptations, and a measure of fortitude necessary to weather rough tides over the course of any contest. Going forward into future seasons, it's going to be my job to evaluate each team's current psychological profile so that I can properly assess when betting opportunities present themselves. On top of that, I'll be trying to figure out whether a team is likely to change tactics and strategy on any given week, as that can produce an element of surprise that could actually sway the spread over to another team.

The Vikings are coming off an incredibly emotional victory, having successfully waged the NFL's largest comeback after rallying from a deficit of 33 points.

These two teams are too different this year that any look into the past wouldn't provide any insight here.

### Giants +3.5

***

Last week showed me that certain teams have a hard time covering comfortably as favorites. Usually, it's the teams with underwhelming offenses and no desire to run up the score that struggle to cover spreads greater than a field goal. The Vikings are one such team. I'm not sure why the team insists on performing just well enough to win games, with little regard for scoring margin. I understand the scoring margin doesn't matter much and only really counts for style points, but it leaves these Vikings and others like them susceptible to lazy performances against underdogs that aren't even taking that many points.

We saw that last week against Indianapolis. Minnesota only actually played one half against the Colts after spending the entire first half sobering up from whatever poison was running through their veins the night before. Keep in mind that the Colts were a short favorite, taking only 3.5 points. But that didn't really matter much for a Minnesota club not known for scoring more than whatever is absolutely necessary to win the game.

The Giants are coming in fresh off a win, sure, but I'm not sure if it could really be considered emotional considering New York maintained control of the game early and never really had to worry about ceding the lead towards the end. Minnesota, on the other hand, is enjoying a major emotional high after staging the greatest comeback in league history. A bit of a recession is expected here.

### Raiders @ Steelers (-2.5)

##### Latest Results

**Raiders**  
@ Rams (L) \[TNF\]  
vs. Patriots (W)

**Steelers**  
vs. Ravens (L)  
@ Panthers (W)

Raiders are coming off a very unexpected win versus the Patriots. First, the team caught a break after an iffy Keelan Cole reception in the end zone was ruled a touchdown. Once that score was confirmed, overtime was all but guaranteed. Things were on track for the game to extend beyond regulation...until a few of New England's offensive players went rogue and did one of the most idiotic things I've ever seen done in a professional football game. Instead of kneeling out the second half to force overtime, the Patriots ran the ball. So that was a bad enough decision by the coaching as is, but what happened afterwards was even worse - instead of taking whatever yards the Raiders were giving them, a few players actually tried to lateral the ball around in a desperate effort to fool the Vegas defense and maybe fall ass-first into the end zone. Instead, Chandler Jones picked off one of those laterals and then took the rock to the opposite end zone. Vegas won the game without the need for any overtime.

##### Injuries

No major injuries on either side, though more will be known later this week when both clubs start practicing.

##### Prior Meetings

Last year this two faced off in primetime over in Heinz Field. Vegas won unexpectedly as significant underdogs. That being said, that match only carries so much weight here considering the Raiders this year are so dramatically different in terms of coaching. Likewise, the Steelers have changed a bit too on offense now that they have fresh faces leading them on offense.

### Steelers -2.5

Once again, this is a test of my theory about emotional victories. The Steelers aren't a great team by any means. But these Raiders are still in the throes of an emotional high after their unexpected win over their head coach's former mentor. I'm not sure Vegas has the mental discipline necessary to reorient themselves in time for this road match against a perceivably lesser opponent.

Using more conventional reasoning here, Pittsburgh has good enough reason to win this game if emotional dynamics didn't matter. Their defensive coaching is smart enough to curb this limited Vegas offense. Most importantly, that Vegas offensive line is still a little loose at the seams, which bodes well for T.J. Watt and company.
