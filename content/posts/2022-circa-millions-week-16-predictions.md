So the lessons I learned last week will inform me going forward. Football is a game that goes far beyond simple statistics and recent performances. Which teams cover the spread week in and week out is more a game of psychology than strategy. A game involving emotional highs and lows, inferiority complexes, strategic adaptations, and a measure of fortitude necessary to weather rough tides over the course of any contest. Going forward into future seasons, it's going to be my job to evaluate each team's current psychological profile so that I can properly assess when betting opportunities present themselves. On top of that, I'll be trying to figure out whether a team is likely to change tactics and strategy on any given week, as that can produce an element of surprise that could actually sway the spread over to another team.

Last week showed me that certain teams have a hard time covering comfortably as favorites. Usually, it's the teams with underwhelming offenses and no desire to run up the score that struggle to cover spreads greater than a field goal. The Vikings are one such team. I'm not sure why the team insists on performing just well enough to win games, with little regard for scoring margin. I understand the scoring margin doesn't matter much and only really counts for style points, but it leaves these Vikings and others like them susceptible to lazy performances against underdogs that aren't even taking that many points.

We saw that last week against Indianapolis. Minnesota only actually played one half against the Colts after spending the entire first half sobering up from whatever poison was running through their veins the night before. Keep in mind that the Colts were a short favorite, taking only 3.5 points. But that didn't really matter much for a Minnesota club unable to play hard enough to win comfortably
