So the lessons I learned last week will inform me going forward. Football is a game that goes far beyond simple statistics and recent performances. Which teams cover the spread week in and week out is more a game of psychology than strategy. A game involving emotional highs and lows, inferiority complexes, strategic adaptations, and a measure of fortitude necessary to weather rough tides over the course of any contest. Going forward into future seasons, it's going to be my job to evaluate each team's current psychological profile so that I can properly assess when betting opportunities present themselves. On top of that, I'll be trying to figure out whether a team is likely to change tactics and strategy on any given week, as that can produce an element of surprise that could actually sway the spread over to another team.

The Vikings are coming off an incredibly emotional victory, having successfully waged the NFL's largest comeback after rallying from a deficit of 33 points.

##### Injuries

No known injuries so far

These two teams are too different this year that any look into the past wouldn't provide any insight here.

### Giants +3.5

***

Last week showed me that certain teams have a hard time covering comfortably as favorites. Usually, it's the teams with underwhelming offenses and no desire to run up the score that struggle to cover spreads greater than a field goal. The Vikings are one such team. I'm not sure why the team insists on performing just well enough to win games, with little regard for scoring margin. I understand the scoring margin doesn't matter much and only really counts for style points, but it leaves these Vikings and others like them susceptible to lazy performances against underdogs that aren't even taking that many points.

We saw that last week against Indianapolis. Minnesota only actually played one half against the Colts after spending the entire first half sobering up from whatever poison was running through their veins the night before. Keep in mind that the Colts were a short favorite, taking only 3.5 points. But that didn't really matter much for a Minnesota club not known for scoring more than whatever is absolutely necessary to win the game.

The Giants are coming in fresh off a win, sure, but I'm not sure if it could really be considered emotional considering New York maintained control of the game early and never really had to worry about ceding the lead towards the end. Minnesota, on the other hand, is enjoying a major emotional high after staging the greatest comeback in league history. A bit of a recession is expected here.

### Raiders @ Steelers (-2.5)

***

##### Latest Results

**Raiders**  
@ Rams (L) \[TNF\]  
vs. Patriots (W)

**Steelers**  
vs. Ravens (L)  
@ Panthers (W)

Raiders are coming off a very unexpected win versus the Patriots. First, the team caught a break after an iffy Keelan Cole reception in the end zone was ruled a touchdown. Once that score was confirmed, overtime was all but guaranteed. Things were on track for the game to extend beyond regulation...until a few of New England's offensive players went rogue and did one of the most idiotic things I've ever seen done in a professional football game. Instead of kneeling out the second half to force overtime, the Patriots ran the ball. So that was a bad enough decision by the coaching as is, but what happened afterwards was even worse - instead of taking whatever yards the Raiders were giving them, a few players actually tried to lateral the ball around in a desperate effort to fool the Vegas defense and maybe fall ass-first into the end zone. Instead, Chandler Jones picked off one of those laterals and then took the rock to the opposite end zone. Vegas won the game without the need for any overtime.

##### Injuries

No major injuries on either side, though more will be known later this week when both clubs start practicing.

##### Prior Meetings

Last year these two faced off in primetime over in Heinz Field. Vegas won unexpectedly as significant underdogs. That being said, that match only carries so much weight here considering the Raiders this year are seriously different in terms of coaching. Likewise, the Steelers have changed a bit too on offense now that they have fresh faces leading them on offense.

***

### Steelers -2.5

***

Once again, this is a test of my theory about emotional victories. The Steelers aren't a great team by any means. But these Raiders are still in the throes of an emotional high after their unexpected win over their head coach's former mentor. I'm not sure Vegas has the mental discipline necessary to ground themselves in time for this road match against a perceivably lesser opponent.

Then again, Pittsburgh has good enough reason to win this game even if emotional dynamics didn't matter. Their defensive coaching is smart enough to curb this limited Vegas offense. Most importantly, that Vegas offensive line is still a little loose at the seams, which bodes well for T.J. Watt and company. If PIttsburgh's defensive front can hold Josh Jacobs at bay and regularly harass Derek Carr in the pocket, a Steeler victory should be certain.

### Bengals @ Patriots (+3.5)

##### Latest Results

**Bengals**  
vs. Browns (W)  
@ Buccaneers (W)

**Patriots**  
@ Cardinals (W) \[MNF\]  
@ Raiders (L)

As I described earlier, the Patriots lost in humiliating fashion last week. I'm not sure if they can shake off the embarrassment from that loss too in the span of a week.

##### Injuries

Cincinnati is almost certain to miss its two best pass rushers in Sam Hubbard and Trey Hendrickson.

Patriots are down a starting lineman in Isaiah Wynn.

##### Prior Meetings

These two franchises last met on the battlefield about three years ago. So we do not have any real history worth exploring here.

***

### Bengals -3.5

***

It worries me that the money's favoring New England so much more than the actual ticket count would have you believe. But these Patriots are just a bad team. I think the issues they have are systemic as well - for a Bill Belichick team to screw the pooch on things like punt returns, game management, and procedure penalties is incredibly bizarre. That ugly series of events on the last play wasn't just a fluke - I think it's indicative of some pervasive cancer festering behind the scenes. Matt Patricia clearly isn't cut out to lead an offense at the professional level, but I do think his leadership has had some parasitic influence over the team as a whole. For whatever reason, Belichick seems to be doing nothing regarding the ills dragging this team down.

So give me a Bengals team here walking into Foxborough with some serious swag. The Bengals have rattled off six straight wins against quality competition. A letdown may be inevitable, but I have a seriously hard time imagining this week is finally that week the Bengals are derailed. And even though this spread is pretty significant given that a road team is the one being favored here, Cincinnati is more than capable of covering this spread.

### Bills @ Bears (+8.5)

##### Latest Results

**Bills**  
vs. Jets (W)  
vs. Dolphins (W) \[Saturday Night Football\]

**Bears**  
vs. Packers (L)  
BYE  
vs. Eagles (L)

Bills are hot off an emotional win against the Dolphins in primetime. Miami made the game much more competitive than many expected.

##### Injuries

The Bills are down some pieces of both the offensive and defensive fronts, most notably Ed Oliver.

Chicago is missing two talented receivers in Chase Claypool and Equianimeous St. Brown. On top of that, they're down a few offensive linemen too.

##### Prior Meetings

Excepting one fluky game with Jacksonville in humid weather, Buffalo's offense last year had its worst game statistically and point-wise against Matt Eberflus's defense back when  Eberflus was still the defensive coordinator with Indianapolis. That knowledge should help a bit here, though any success Chicago achieves will be limited given the dearth of talent on that side of the ball.

***

### Bears +8.5

***

I'm mostly riding on emotional dynamics here. The Bills are coming off a riveting game in which a last-second field goal was needed to assert victory not only against their division rivals, the Miami Dolphins, but also to claim the division crown. That field goal was a bit harrowing too given the rough weather at the time - Buffalo had to burn a timeout to ensure their men had enough time to dig out the snow so as to minimizes the chances of the kicker slipping against the turf. If there's any doubt about the raw emotions behind the game, Josh Allen was seen telling Miami fans to go home after the game was finalized. 

On top of that, Eberflus has some past familiarity with the Bills defense, something I suspect will go a long way towards keeping this game competitive. I do need the Bears defense to make a stand or two to ensure this spread is covered comfortably. While I do expect Justin Fields to eat his fair share against a Buffalo defense known for being a little too soft against opposing rushers, I do expect the Bills to make a few defensive stops on their end given the limited nature of Chicago's overall offense.

### Commanders @ 49ers (-7)

##### Latest Results

**Commanders**  
@ Giants (T)  
BYE  
vs. Giants (L) (SNF)

**49ers**  
vs. Buccaneers (W)  
@ Seahawks (W) (TNF)

Washington has lost some face in the past several weeks after two disappointing outings against their big brother New York Giants.

##### Injuries

Washington should finally see the return of defensive end Chase Young. I'd be shocked if he makes an immediate impact after spending so much time away from real action.

Deebo Samuel is out for the 49ers, and starting cornerback Ward is questionable with a concussion.

##### Prior Meetings

These two last met two years ago. That meeting holds a little relevance here given the coaching staffs haven't changed much since then. Ron Rivera and company were able to surprise folks by winning as underdogs. Both teams have improved since then, though it seems San Francisco has improved much more compared to the Commanders.

***

### Commanders +7

***

As I said before, this line is largely the result of Washington losing some serious credibility over the past weekends thanks to disappointing games against the Giants, a team many in the public see as inferior. On paper, yes, New York is a worse team compared to the Commanders. But the reality is that it's quite possible this Washington team is saddled with an inferiority complex against the Giants. Three of the past four years, New York has swept Washington in their divisional series - last year was the odd season out, but much of that can probably be attributed to the general dysfunction drowning the Giants organization at the time.

If this inferiority complex theory of mine is true, than Washington is being unfairly valued here. One can make the argument that Washington's defense doesn't lag too far behind San Francisco's own respective unit in terms of efficacy. Offensively, the 49ers have more versatility and vectors of attack, but it's not like Washington's short on weaponry of their own.

**Seahawks**

**Chiefs**  
vs. Broncos (W)  
@ Texans (W)

Good opportunity to test whether Seattle is going to go on the road even more hungry now after suffering through two bad losses at home.

##### Injuries

Despite so many key players missing practice this week, Pete Carroll is pretty confident many of them will be playing. Tyler Lockett is definitively out though, and that's going to hurt.

Kansas is pretty healthy, relatively speaking.
