So the lessons I learned last week will inform me going forward. Football is a game that goes far beyond simple statistics and recent performances. Which teams cover the spread week in and week out is more a game of psychology than strategy. A game involving emotional highs and lows, inferiority complexes, strategic adaptations, and a measure of fortitude necessary to weather rough tides over the course of any contest. Going forward into future seasons, it's going to be my job to evaluate each team's current psychological profile so that I can properly assess when betting opportunities present themselves. On top of that, I'll be trying to figure out whether a team is likely to change tactics and strategy on any given week, as that can produce an element of surprise that could actually sway the spread over to another team.
