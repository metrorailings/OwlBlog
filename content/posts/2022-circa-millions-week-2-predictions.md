All right, I suck. 1-4 last week. What a depressing start to the season. To be fair, I was competitive in two of those games as well, but Philadelphia and Jacksonville ultimately lost control of their respective contests late in the fourth quarter. Bastards.

Anyway...a great second week would pretty much quiet the lingering pain from last week. So let's focus harder this time.

***

### Jets @ Browns (-6)

***

##### _Streaks_

Jets - 1L  
Browns - 1W

##### _Injuries_

Obviously, Zack Wilson remains out as he recovers from a knee issue. The bigger loss here is C.J. Uzomah - without Uzomah, Flacco doesn't have a reliable tight end option in the passing game.

The Browns are mostly healthy, although their two starting tackles are dealing with some afflictions. One has already been ruled out while the other is trending towards playing.

##### _Weather_

Great weather

##### _History_

Neither of these two teams have met recently. Robert Saleh and Kevin Stefansky have met one another on the field as coaching opponents before, back in 2019. Saleh was the defensive coordinator of a 49ers defense loaded with talent while Stefanski was coaching Minnesota's offense with Kirk Cousins as his quarterback. The 49ers dominated that game.

***

### Jets +6

***

Hard to side with the Jets here, but six points is a little much for a team led by the likes of Jacoby Brissett. I don't think Cleveland's defensive coaching is going to spend much time strategizing against these Jets either, considering the divisional bout against the Steelers looming next Thursday. Now if Mike LaFleur can pull his head from his ass long enough to put forward a competent game plan, New York may end up surprising some folks here with an outright upset.

***

### Buccaneers @ Saints (+2.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Buccaneers - 1W  
Saints - 1W

##### _Injuries_

Brady will be without tackle Donovan Smith and his favorite receiver in Chris Godwin. Not good. All the other players are expected to show though.

Saints are dealing with some injury concerns of their own, the biggest one being Alvin Kamara, who didn't practice for much of the week. Jameis Winston is dealing with some back issues as well, though it doesn't seem as serious as what Mac Jones is going through. 

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

These two clubs have met five times over the past two seasons. And if there's one thing that's been made increasingly evident with each passing game, it's that Dennis Allen and his coaches are damn near masterful at rending Brady and the Tampa offense gutless.

***

### Saints +2.5

***

Even without Sean Payton, the Saints don't need much motivation to bring their A-game against their divisional arch-rivals. So long as the collective will to win against their hated rivals is there and Dennis Allen can still draft a masterful game plan for the defense in his new capacity as head coach, New Orleans should be able to rein in Tampa's offense, especially now that the latter's missing some critical playmakers from last year. if Jameis Winston doesn't cough up the ball more than once, the Saints should win fairly comfortably.

***

### Patriots @ Steelers (+2)

***

##### _Streaks_

Patriots - 1L  
Steelers - 1W

##### _Injuries_

The Steelers will be without their best player on defense for the next several weeks. But the Patriots have some concerns with Mac Jones - even though Jones wasn't tagged with any sort of injury designation this Friday, back injuries don't really go away so quickly. So it remains to be seen whether his back is still an issue heading into this match-up.

##### _Weather_

Solid weather for football

##### _History_

Despite the fact that Tomlin and Belichick have an established rivalry, neither of these two teams have met recently. In fact, things have changed considerably for both organizations since they last met - each club now features an offense led by new faces on the field and on the sidelines.

That being said, defensive philosophies haven't shifted much, so these two teams have some familiarity there.

***

### Uncertain

***

My first impression is that New England should win this match comfortably, if only because unlike their opponents, the Patriots are functional on both sides of the ball. The same can't be said about the Steelers given the sorry state of their offense. I need to assess the tape, but I heard Pittsburgh's offense was downright awful last week against the Bengals - it was the defense working an overtime shift that carried the team to an unexpected win. I don't foresee things being much better offensively this Sunday either, considering Trubisky's is well-established as a failed passing prospect.

But Pittsburgh also has some things in its favor. It's been reported that Mac Jones sustained some back pain from his outing against Miami last week. Even though he's expected to play, the Patriot offense might be forced to operate at only a fraction of its potential, especially considering Pittsburgh boasts a top-flight defense. I'll need to assess the injury report better before figuring out whether a pick can be made here.

***

### Bengals @ Cowboys (+7)

***

##### _Streaks_

Bengals - 1L  
Cowboys - 1L

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Some sun is expected. For some reason, Cowboys stadium can be a difficult place to throw when the sunlight is allowed to stream freely through the opening in the roof.

##### _History_

These two teams last danced with one another a couple years ago, when their current head coaches were just starting out in their respective roles. It's also worth noting that neither of the quarterbacks that started in that game will be starting here, as are a good number of the key players. That being said, Dallas did thoroughly dominate that match.

***

### Bengals -7

***

It's always a little risky siding with a road favorite so heavily favored by the book, but Joe Burrow can make some serious hay against Dallas defense so long as Dan Quinn insists on keeping only a single safety in the backfield. These are the types of defenses where Burrow and his weapons exploit best.

I still haven't forgotten how Cooper Rush was able to lead the offense to a surprise win over in Minnesota last year, but the 2021 Vikings had one of the worst defenses in the league, statistically speaking. The Bengals, on the other hand, have one of the best defenses in the league, led by blue-chip coach Lou Anarumo. So don't expect Cooper to experience that same level of success against this stingy Bengals defense. Kellen Moore will likely try to incorporate some exotic concepts in his playbook to try and manufacture production, but these plays can only strike oil a few times before they lose value, as I expect Anarumo will quickly adjust to these new tricks Moore will try to leverage.

***

### Texans @ Broncos (-10)

***

##### _Streaks_

Texans - 1W  
Broncos - 1L

Yes, I know Houston ended last week's game in a tie. That's a win for them, considering they were serious underdogs.

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

A gorgeous day for some professional football

##### _History_

Neither of these two organizations have faced one another recently. Nathanniel Hackett and Lovie Smith aren't too familiar with one another either. 

***

### Texans +10

***

Last week's limp showing against Seattle demonstrated that Denver is far from a finished product. They're bound to improve over the course of the season, especially once Hackett settles into his role as a first-time head coach. One week won't be enough to address all their woes, especially on offense.

The reality is that Houston isn't as bad as the market may have pegged them. Davis Mills is actually one of the more serviceable quarterbacks in the league. On top of that, the defense has some feistiness in them, especially now that Jerry Hughes has fully embraced his role as the team's primary pass rusher. So ten points is way too much here for two teams much closer to one another than the public may think.

***

### Cardinals @ Raiders (-5.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Cardinals - 1L  
Raiders - 1L

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

It's a dome affair.

##### _History_

Patrick Graham and Kliff Kingsbury did dance once together a couple years ago, when Graham was a first-year defensive coordinator with the Giants. It was an uphill battle for Graham's unit, considering Arizona's defense netted three turnovers and eight sacks against the Giants.

***

### Uncertain

***

I'm still not certain about this one. The Raiders showed some promise last week against the Chargers, but Derek Carr's poor play worries me. It is pretty obvious Kyler Murray is limited, especially when he's without some key weapons. But Carr's ceiling has always been uncertain - working under Jon Gruden did little to shed light there. I was counting on Josh McDaniels showing me whether Carr is cut out to lead a team to the promised land, so his performance last week has me worried. If he struggles to play in whatever system McDaniels is installing, covering tall spreads like 5.5 becomes significantly difficult.

***

### Titans @ Bills (-9.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Titans - 1L  
Bills - 1W

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Typical autumn weather

##### _History_

Tennessee hosted Buffalo last October in a primetime game. Oddly enough, the handicap last year wasn't that far off from the number here - the Bills were favored by 6 points on the road. Tennessee won that game thanks to a sensational performance by Henry as well as some clutch passes to A.J. Brown.

***

### Bills -9.5

***

It's a heavy number, but Tennessee's offense is missing some horses from last year, namely A.J. Brown and Julio Jones. I'm not sure if Tannehill can sustain a passing game on the road by relying exclusively on rookie and sophomore receivers. Dontrel Hilliard will really need to break out here. Because if Tennessee is forced to rely exclusively on Derrick Henry and the ground game to generate production, things are likely to end ugly for them. Despite his gaudy numbers against the Bills last year, Henry was only really successful on a third of his runs. One would think Henry would have found more success running against Buffalo's smaller front seven, but McDermott's unit was able to control him for much of the game.  I expect only better things from the Bills given this is going to be their home opener.
