All right, I suck. 1-4 last week. What a depressing start to the season. To be fair, I was competitive in two of those games as well, but Philadelphia and Jacksonville ultimately lost control of their respective contests late in the fourth quarter. Bastards.

Anyway...a great second week would pretty much quiet the lingering pain from last week. So let's focus harder this time.

### Jets @ Browns (-6)

***

##### _Streaks_

Jets - 1L  
Browns - 1W

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Great weather

##### _History_

Neither of these two teams have met recently. Robert Saleh and Kevin Stefansky have met one another on the field as coaching opponents before, back in 2019. Saleh was the defensive coordinator of a 49ers defense loaded with talent while Stefanski was coaching Minnesota's offense with Kirk Cousins as his quarterback. The 49ers dominated that game.

### Jets +6

***

Hard to side with the Jets here, but six points is a little much for a team led by the likes of Jacoby Brissett. I don't think Cleveland's defensive coaching is going to spend much time strategizing against these Jets either, considering the divisional bout against the Steelers looming next Thursday. Now if Mike LaFleur can pull his head from his ass long enough to put forward a competent game plan, New York may end up surprising some folks here with an outright upset.

### Buccaneers @ Saints (+2.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Buccaneers - 1W  
Saints - 1W

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

These two clubs have met five times over the past two seasons. And if there's one thing that's been made increasingly evident with each passing game, it's that Dennis Allen and his coaches are damn near masterful at rending Brady and the Tampa offense gutless.

***

### Saints +2.5

***

Even without Sean Payton, the Saints don't need much motivation to bring their A-game against their divisional arch-rivals. So long as the collective will to win against their hated rivals is there and Dennis Allen can still draft a masterful game plan for the defense in his new capacity as head coach, New Orleans should be able to rein in Tampa's offense, especially now that the latter's missing some critical playmakers from last year. if Jameis Winston doesn't cough up the ball more than once, the Saints should win fairly comfortably.

### Patriots @ Steelers (+2)

***

##### _Streaks_

Patriots - 1L  
Steelers - 1W

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Solid weather for football

##### _History_

Despite the fact that Tomlin and Belichick have an established rivalry, neither of these two teams have met recently. In fact, things have changed considerably for both organizations since they last met - each club now features an offense led by new faces on the field and on the sidelines.

That being said, defensive philosophies haven't shifted much, so these two teams have some familiarity there.

### Uncertain

My first impression is that New England should win this match comfortably, if only because unlike their opponents, the Patriots are functional on both sides of the ball. The same can't be said about the Steelers given the sorry state of their offense. I need to assess the tape, but I heard the offense was downright awful last week against the Bengals - the defense had to work two additional shifts just to eke out the win. I don't foresee things being much better this Sunday considering Trubisky's well-established as a failed passing prospect.

But Pittsburgh also has some things in its favor. It's been reported that Mac Jones sustained some back pain from his outing against Miami last week. Even though he's expected to play, the Patriot offense might be forced to operate at only a fraction of its potential, especially considering Pittsburgh boasts a top-flight defense. I'll need to assess the injury report better before figuring out whether a pick can be made here.

### Bengals @ Cowboys (+7)

***

##### _Streaks_

Bengals - 1L  
Cowboys - 1L

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Some sun is expected. For some reason, Cowboys stadium can be a difficult place to throw when the sunlight is allowed to stream freely through the opening in the roof.

##### _History_

These two teams last danced with one another a couple years ago, when their current head coaches were just starting out in their respective roles. It's also worth noting that neither of the quarterbacks that started in that game will be starting here, as are a good number of the key players. That being said, Dallas did thoroughly dominate that match.

***

### Bengals -7

***

It's always a little risky siding with a road favorite so heavily favored by the book, but Joe Burrow can make some serious hay against Dallas defense so long as Dan Quinn insists on keeping only a single safety in the backfield. These are the types of defenses where Burrow and his weapons exploit best.

I still haven't forgotten how Cooper Rush was able to lead the offense to a surprise win over in Minnesota last year, but the 2021 Vikings had one of the worst defenses in the league, statistically speaking. The Bengals, on the other hand, have one of the best defenses in the league, led by blue-chip coach Lou Anarumo. So don't expect Cooper to experience that same level of success against this stingy Bengals defense. Kellen Moore will likely try to incorporate some exotic concepts in his playbook to try and manufacture production, but these plays can only strike oil a few times before they lose value, as I expect Anarumo will quickly adjust to these new tricks Moore will try to leverage.
