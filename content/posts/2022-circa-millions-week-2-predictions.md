All right, I suck. 1-4 last week. What a depressing start to the season. To be fair, I was competitive in two of those games as well, but Philadelphia and Jacksonville ultimately lost control of their respective contests late in the fourth quarter. Bastards.

Anyway...a great second week would pretty much quiet the lingering pain from last week. So let's focus harder this time.

### Jets @ Browns (-6)

Jets - 1L

Great weather

##### _History_

Neither of these two teams have met recently. Robert Saleh and Kevin Stefansky have met one another on the field as coaching opponents before, back in 2019. Saleh was the defensive coordinator of a 49ers defense loaded with talent while Stefanski was coaching Minnesota's offense with Kirk Cousins as his quarterback. The 49ers dominated that game.

### Jets +6

Hard to side with the Jets here, but six points is a little much for a team led by the likes of Jacoby Brissett. I don't think Cleveland's defensive coaching is going to spend much time strategizing against these Jets either, considering the divisional bout against the Steelers looming next Thursday. Now if Mike LaFleur can pull his head from his ass long enough to put forward a competent game plan, New York may end up surprising some folks here with an outright upset.

### Buccaneers @ Saints (+2.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Buccaneers - 1W  
Saints - 1W

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

These two clubs have met five times over the past two seasons. And if there's one thing that's been made increasingly evident with each passing game, it's that Dennis Allen and his coaches are damn near masterful rendering Brady and the Tampa offense gutless.

### Saints +2.5

***

Even without Sean Payton, the Saints don't need much motivation to bring their A-game against their divisional arch-rivals. So long as the will is there and Dennis Allen can still draft a masterful game plan for the defense in his new capacity as head coach, New Orleans should be able to rein in Tampa's offense, especially now that it's missing some critical playmakers from last year. So long as Jameis Winston doesn't cough up the ball more than once, the Saints should win.

### Patriots @ Steelers (+2)

***

##### _Streaks_

Patriots - 1L  
Steelers - 1W

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Solid weather for football

##### _History_

Despite the fact that Tomlin and Belichick have an established rivalry, neither of these two teams have met recently. In fact, things have changed considerably for both organizations since they last met - both teams have offenses led by faces new to each club.
