All right, this may by far by the most idiotic thing I've said on this blog....but despite going 1-4 last week...my picks weren't all that awful. Honest.

Two picks were screwed by luck. Nobody knew Jameis Winston was dealing with **4 fractures** until Sunday morning. I have no idea what Pete Carmichael or Dennis Allen are doing, putting Famous Jameis out there with a broken back. The Saints defense performed exactly how I expected, but the offense was so flaccid that not even Cialis could get it going. Great defensive performances rarely carry a team to a win in today's NFL. The other pick that lady luck robbed from me was the 49er game. I was truly counting on Trey Lance to sabotage his own offense, sapping the morale of his defensive teammates in the process. A low-scoring game would have all but assured that Seattle would cover against such a wide number. Instead, Lance's ankle cracked and Garoppalo was called back into action to lead the offense. Under somebody that can actually pass the ball and run a professional offense, Seattle was doomed.

The Cincinnati pick was a bad one. Dan Quinn adjusted his style of defense, keeping two safeties deep. This kept Cincinnati from connecting on the types of passes that give their offense rhythm. On top of that, Burrow was never settled into the pocket, as the Cowboy defensive front constantly wrought havoc in the offensive backfield. Their best drive was a fourth quarter one that spanned 19 plays and 9 minutes of the game clock. It's not the style of offense they want to be playing.

Las Vegas losing outright though...that I have to revisit. Even the sharps seemingly were betting big on the Raiders, so for them to lose is a freaky result. I suspect Vance Joseph got the better of Josh McDaniels in the second half. If that's the case, I need to reevaluate their rankings.
