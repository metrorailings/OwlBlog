All right, this may by far by the most idiotic thing I've said on this blog....but despite going 1-4 last week...my picks weren't all that awful. Honest.

Two picks were screwed by luck. Nobody knew Jameis Winston was dealing with **4 fractures** until Sunday morning. I have no idea what Pete Carmichael or Dennis Allen are doing, putting Famous Jameis out there with a broken back. The Saints defense performed exactly how I expected, but the offense was so flaccid that not even Cialis could get it going. .
