All right, this may by far by the most idiotic thing I've said on this blog....but despite going 0-4 last Sunday...my picks weren't all that awful. Honest.

Two picks were screwed by luck. Nobody knew Jameis Winston was dealing with **4 fractures** until Sunday morning. I have no idea what Pete Carmichael or Dennis Allen are doing, putting Famous Jameis out there with a broken back. The Saints defense performed exactly how I expected, but the offense was so flaccid that not even Cialis could get it going. Great defensive performances rarely carry a team to a win in today's NFL. The other pick that lady luck robbed from me was the 49er game. I was truly counting on Trey Lance to sabotage his own offense, sapping the morale of his defensive teammates in the process. A low-scoring game would have all but assured that Seattle would cover against such a wide number. Instead, Lance's ankle cracked and Garoppalo was called back into action to lead the offense. Under somebody that can actually pass the ball and run a professional offense, Seattle was doomed.

The Cincinnati pick was a bad one. Dan Quinn adjusted his style of defense, keeping two safeties deep. This kept Cincinnati from connecting on the types of passes that give their offense rhythm. On top of that, Burrow never settled into the pocket as the Cowboy defensive front constantly wrought havoc in the offensive backfield. Their best drive was a fourth quarter one that spanned 19 plays and 9 minutes of the game clock. It's not the style of offense they want to be playing.

Las Vegas losing outright though...that I have to revisit. Even the sharps were seemingly betting big on the Raiders, so for them to lose is a freaky result. I suspect Vance Joseph got the better of Josh McDaniels in the second half. If that's the case, I need to reevaluate their rankings. That being said, the Cardinals still needed considerable luck to ultimately tip the game in their favor.

All right, after watching through the game tape for the Vegas/Arizona game...the Raiders are much worse than I thought on both sides of the ball. I gave this team too much credit. I figured with all the success Josh McDaniels and Patrick Graham have experienced in their prior roles combined with the considerable talent across the roster, these Raiders would start fast. That's not the case. Schematically, the team is pretty boring. It feels like this club is far less than the sum of its parts, which doesn't speak well about the coaching. Arizona was clearly the better team.

We will need to wait on the results of the Titans/Bills game tomorrow to see if this week will truly end winless for me.

All right, so my Bills pick panned out. That was an example of a game where my instinct was wrong. I Initially assumed Mike Vrabel would do everything in his power to right the ship after a humiliating defeat against a major underdog. But as I noted in my insights, this Tennessee team isn't the same as the one the Bills faced last year. It wasn't feeding off home field advantage or the emotions of primetime. Furthermore, it was missing some critical weapons that played a major role in last year's win. A great coach can only do so much with the cards he's given. So I switched over to Buffalo, especially after I realized things would be damn near raucous as it was their home opener.

So all in all...not great, but not catastrophic. Listen, I'm not going to win the contest. These two weeks killed me - luck wasn't on my side especially.

It's hard not to overreact to what happened recently, but it looks to me that these Lions  have truly evolved, at least on offense. Not only is the rushing game so much more proficient, Jared Goff is actually throwing the ball further down the field than expected. Ben Johnson has renovated this unit into one of the more capable outfits in the league today. 

Minnesota is undergoing its own renovation too, especially on defense. Under Ed Donatell, it seems pretty clear these Vikings are committed much more to defensing the pass. Unfortunately, that may backfire against them against this renewed Detroit ground game. On top of that, Minnesota has issues in coverage, particularly spacing - that plays well for Goff should he need to connect with Amon-Ra St. Brown.
