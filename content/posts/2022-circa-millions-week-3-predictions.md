All right, this may by far by the most idiotic thing I've said on this blog....but despite going 0-4 last Sunday...my picks weren't all that awful. Honest.

Two picks were screwed by luck. Nobody knew Jameis Winston was dealing with **4 fractures** until Sunday morning. I have no idea what Pete Carmichael or Dennis Allen are doing, putting Famous Jameis out there with a broken back. The Saints defense performed exactly how I expected, but the offense was so flaccid that not even Cialis could get it going. Great defensive performances rarely carry a team to a win in today's NFL. The other pick that lady luck robbed from me was the 49er game. I was truly counting on Trey Lance to sabotage his own offense, sapping the morale of his defensive teammates in the process. A low-scoring game would have all but assured that Seattle would cover against such a wide number. Instead, Lance's ankle cracked and Garoppalo was called back into action to lead the offense. Under somebody that can actually pass the ball and run a professional offense, Seattle was doomed.

The Cincinnati pick was a bad one. Dan Quinn adjusted his style of defense, keeping two safeties deep. This kept Cincinnati from connecting on the types of passes that give their offense rhythm. On top of that, Burrow never settled into the pocket as the Cowboy defensive front constantly wrought havoc in the offensive backfield. Their best drive was a fourth quarter one that spanned 19 plays and 9 minutes of the game clock. It's not the style of offense they want to be playing.

Las Vegas losing outright though...that I have to revisit. Even the sharps were seemingly betting big on the Raiders, so for them to lose is a freaky result. I suspect Vance Joseph got the better of Josh McDaniels in the second half. If that's the case, I need to reevaluate their rankings. That being said, the Cardinals still needed considerable luck to ultimately tip the game in their favor.

***

All right, after watching through the game tape for the Vegas/Arizona game...the Raiders are much worse than I thought on both sides of the ball. I gave this team too much credit. I figured with all the success Josh McDaniels and Patrick Graham have experienced in their prior roles combined with the considerable talent across the roster, these Raiders would start fast. That's not the case. Schematically, the team is pretty boring. It feels like this club is far less than the sum of its parts, which doesn't speak well about the coaching. Arizona was clearly the better team.

We will need to wait on the results of the Titans/Bills game tomorrow to see if this week will truly end winless for me.

***

All right, so my Bills pick panned out. That was an example of a game where my instinct was wrong. I Initially assumed Mike Vrabel would do everything in his power to right the ship after a humiliating defeat against a major underdog. But as I noted in my insights, this Tennessee team isn't the same as the one the Bills faced last year. It wasn't feeding off home field advantage or the emotions of primetime. Furthermore, it was missing some critical weapons that played a major role in last year's win. A great coach can only do so much with the cards he's given. So I switched over to Buffalo, especially after I realized things would be damn near raucous as it was their home opener.

So all in all...not great, but not catastrophic. Listen, I'm not going to win the contest. These two weeks killed me - luck wasn't on my side especially.

### Lions @ Vikings (-6)

***

##### _Streaks_

Lions - 1W  
Vikings - 1L

##### _Injuries_

Detroit and Minnesota should be entering this game with their key players mostly healthy.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

The Lions performed well against Minnesota in both of their outings last year, even winning a game on their home turf late in the season.

***

### Lions +6

***

It's hard not to overreact to what happened recently, but it looks to me that these Lions  have truly evolved, at least on offense. Not only is the rushing game so much more proficient, Jared Goff is actually throwing the ball further down the field than expected. Ben Johnson has renovated this unit into one of the more capable outfits in the league today.

Minnesota is undergoing its own renovation too, especially on defense. Under Ed Donatell, it seems pretty clear these Vikings are committed much more to defensing the pass. Unfortunately, that may backfire against them against this renewed Detroit ground game. On top of that, Minnesota has issues in coverage, particularly spacing - that plays well for Goff should he need to connect with Amon-Ra St. Brown.

Keep in mind that Minnesota will likely have an explosive day on offense as well. Even though the Lions have taken us by surprise on offense, their defense still remains as disappointing as ever, even in spite of the recent emergence of Aidan Hutchinson as a premiere pass rusher. So it's possible Minnesota could drive the score up early, forcing Detroit to rely more on Goff to keep them competitive. If that ends up being the case, things may not end well for Lion backers.

### Eagles @ Commanders (+6.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Eagles - 1W  
Commanders - 1L

##### _Injuries_

Philadelphia will be missing the services of Derek Barnett for some time now that he's on injured reserve. It didn't seem to matter much last Monday, but it's an injury worth noting going forward.

No major injuries of note on Washington's side.

##### _Weather_

Nice temperate weather with a bit of humidity expected.

##### _History_

Late last year, the Commanders performed well enough on their home turf against a Philadelphia club that's fully embraced a run-first philosophy on offense. Can they pull that same feat off again with Carson Wentz under center instead of Taylor Heinecke?

***

### Uncertain

***

It's clear Ron Rivera and Jack Del Rio have a beat on this Philadelphia offense, even if they have yet to win against these Sirianni-era Eagles. Philadelphia needed a fourth quarter comeback to post the win over Washington.

But it's hard siding with the Commanders knowing they have the worse coaches and the worse quarterback. What does Washington have going for them here from a non-historical perspective, home field advantage and six points handicapped in their favor?

***

### Raiders @ Titans (+2)

***

##### _Streaks_

Raiders - 2L  
Titans - 2L

##### _Injuries_

Hunter Renfrow is dealing with a concussion, so his game-time status is hazy.

Tennessee will likely miss a few key players themselves. Taylor Lewan and Bud Dupree haven't been practicing. Dontrell Hilliard has been practicing in limited capacity after missing the last game, so his status is anything but certain.

##### _Weather_

Sunny weather with some humidity expected

##### _History_

These two haven't faced one another recently, although Josh McDaniels and Mike Vrabel have squared off last year when the former was still the offensive coordinator of the Patriots. New England whupped Vrabel's Titans that day, although Tennessee was considerably short-handed and still looking to develop new weapons to replace A.J. Brown and Julio Jones. That being said, McDaniels was fully comfortable back then in his capacity as an assistant coach on the Patriots. He's yet to find that same comfort so far with the Raiders. 

***

### Titans +2

***

After watching the Raiders blow a game last week against the Cardinals, I came away just unimpressed. Mike McDaniel's having little trouble incorporating his best weapons in the offense, so why is Josh McDaniels having a rough time pulling off that same feat in Las Vegas, especially when Derek Carr and Davante Adams have a rapport with one another dating back to their college days? In fact, how is a journeyman like Mack Hollins a more critical part of the offense than Adams or Darren Waller? Maybe his outsized role on this offense is just the result of a freaky couple weeks, but it worries me that Derek Carr still doesn't feel all too comfortable in whatever system Josh McDaniels is instituting in place. 

On top of that, the linebackers looked pathetically slow last week against Arizona's ground game. To be fair, it's not easy catching Kyler's little munchkin ass when he's pitter-pattering all over the place, but Arizona's tailbacks were balling out as well in the second half. Tennessee has a respectable ground game that's been looking to re-establish itself after an ugly start to the season. This week is **the** week for Vrabel and the Titans - if they can't rediscover their groove at home against an uninspiring Vegas outfit, then the season is truly lost.

One more thing worth discussing here is the Titan passing game. Despite being absolutely obliterated by the Bills last week, the Titans showed some promise, particular on offense - I think Todd Downing and Ryan Tannehill finally found some ways to utilize Treylon Burks and Robert Woods in the passing game. If Burks, Woods, and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine can combine their talents and contribute with multiple receptions, Tennessee might have a serviceable air attack to accompany Derrick Henry and the power rushing game. It'll be enough against this lazy Raider defense.

### Saints @ Panthers (+2.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Saints - 1L  
Panthers - 2L

##### _Injuries_

New Orleans baffles me. Jameis Winston can't be fully functional so long as he's dealing with fractures in his back. I don't understand how the Saints can claim he's just fine. Alvin Kamara is limited as well, and it's worth keeping an eye on him given his absence last week against the Bucs.

Christian McCaffrey is always a few steps away from major injury, but he seems on track to play this Sunday.

##### _Weather_

Sunny weather with some humidity expected

##### _History_

Rivals in the NFC South, these two organizations know each other well. Back when the Panthers were playing hot, Carolina rolled over the Saints at home. They lost the rematch later in the year though.

***

### Panthers +2.5

***

As long as Jameis is dealing with a lingering back injury, I cannot think New Orleans stands a chance of winning. As we saw last week, Winston seems to have reverted back to old form now that the fractures in his back are compromising him. If Carolina's defense can get their act together after a two-game losing skid, it's possible the Panthers may be able to salvage their season as it teeters on the brink.
