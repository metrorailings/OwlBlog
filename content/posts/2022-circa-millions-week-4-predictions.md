All right, so last week was better. One thing I learned - I wish I railed against the Chargers. I was worried Los Angeles would pull off some magic now that their quarterback was hobbled and everybody was betting against them. But the Chargers don't really have the coaching necessary to pull off that feat. If anything, Jacksonville has established the legitimacy of their coaching staff with this road win. Congratulations to the Jaguars for finally finding some stability in that aspect.

Also, never trust Carson Wentz against a good team, period. It was only a matter of time before Wentz would humiliate the team and it came much sooner than expected. Washington may well have the league's worst offense when all is said and done this season.

Also, one word about the Buccaneers - the offense is worthless without its receiving weapons. I'm not sure if Brady has more say over the way things are run on that side of the ball now that Bruce Arians is no longer head coach, but the unwillingness to run the ball and incorporate Leonard Fournette in schemed plays seriously worries me. Brady and the brain trust down in Tampa were fully aware that the club was down some critical weaponry in the passing game, yet it's clear their strategy to win on offense started first and foremost by establishing the pass with their limited firepower. I'm really disappointed in them.

### Bills @ Ravens (+3)

***

##### _Streaks_

Bills - 1L  
Ravens - 1W

##### _Injuries_

Buffalo is still a bit short-handed in the secondary so long as Jordan Poyer remains unable to play. The real question is whether Ed Oliver can suit up, especially now that Jordan Phillips has been declared out. Buffalo needs all the help it can get against Lamar and the run-heavy Baltimore defense.  

##### _Weather_

Some rain is expected

##### _History_

These two danced a couple years ago in the playoffs. Even though the score would suggest neither team really impressed, the reality was that Buffalo restrained Lamar Jackson from running wild on them. On top of that, the Bills also concentrated their pass coverage on the middle of the field, forcing Lamar to have to throw outside the numbers in order to generate any production through the air. At the time, Lamar wasn't able to make those types of passes.

***

### Bills -3

***

Not all too comfortable siding with Buffalo here given Lamar's been playing at a high level. But Baltimore's defense is very much a work-in-progress under Mike Macdonald. Miami and New England have exposed some serious flaws with the way that unit operates. I expect Josh Allen to do the same. Buffalo's own defense has issues now that injuries have impacted multiple position groups, but Sean McDermott should still be able to devise a plan that's good enough to limit Lamar in spurts.

***

### Chargers @ Texans (+5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Chargers - 1L  
Texans - 2L

##### _Injuries_

Justin Herbert is still dealing with a rib injury that won't fully heal for a few weeks. Perhaps just as worrying, they're down key pieces along the offensive and defensive lines. Arguably their best player on defense will be out for the season. And the offensive line is so depleted that Storm Norton is now being called to protect Herbert in the pocket. To make matters worse, Keenan Allen isn't forecasted to play either. 

##### _Weather_

Clear and lovely weather

##### _History_

The Texans housed the Chargers last year as double-digit underdogs, thanks to a career game from Rex Burkhead, who gashed the Chargers for big yardage.

***

### Texans +5

***

Watching the Chargers play last week, I still see opposing rushers having a lovely time just running up yards against them. If Dameon Pierce is given more leash here, Houston's ground game should help them find some points here.

On top of that, this offense isn't the same now that Herbert is still recovering from rib cartilage issues. If Jerry Hughes, Rasheem Green, and the rest of Houston's feisty defense can harangue Herbert, expect the man to make some mistakes.

### Patriots @ Packers (-9.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Patriots - 1L  
Packers - 2W

##### _Injuries_

With Mac Jones sidelined with a high ankle sprain, Brian Hoyer will now start as the quarterback of the Patriots offense.

Green Bay is remarkably healthy.

##### _Weather_

Cloudy and temperate

##### _History_

No recent history between these two organization or their main coaches

***

### Patriots +9.5

***

The Patriots are a middling team, but Green Bay doesn't deserve to be such massive favorites here considering their offense hasn't hit full stride - Aaron Rodgers is still developing connections with his younger receivers.

Then again, Brian Hoyer is starting in this game. And I worry he may be completely out of his depth, having not seriously played football the past couple years.

***

### Cardinals @ Panthers (-1)

***

##### _Streaks_

Cardinals - 1L  
Panthers - 1W

##### _Injuries_

It's possible Arizona could be without Hollywood Brown after the wide receiver appeared on the injury roll Friday with a foot injury. Not good. But on the flip side, Rondale Moore could finally be making his debut this season.

Carolina seems to be concerned about Christian McCaffrey, who's only managed to log one practice this week. Not good if their best weapon on offense fails to suit up or leaves early.

##### _Weather_

Cloudy, but otherwise pleasant

##### _History_

When these two teams played one another last year, the Panthers surprised everybody and won the game outright despite the sportsbooks pegging them as double-digit underdogs. But a closer look at the game and one can see why **that** game doesn't necessary hold much value in assessing **this** game. First off, the Panthers now have a different offensive coordinator on their staff, one who preaches the west coast approach to offense. Second (and most importantly), neither of the quarterbacks that played in that game will be playing here. Kyler Murray was sidelined with injury in that contest, forcing Colt McCoy to start in his stead. On Carolina's side, that club was riding a short-lived high after reuniting with the beloved Cam Newton. In fact, it was Cam Newton who set the tone early by scoring on a few gadget plays. PJ Walker was the other quarterback playing as well for Carolina, given Newton's unfamiliarity with the playbook. Unlike experienced back-up quarterbacks, very little tape is out there on PJ Walker, so Vance Joseph had to draft a defensive game plan without really understanding what Carolina's offense was going to do with PJ Walker at the helm.

Things are much more predictable now in this rematch, especially now that Kyler Murray is still healthy and Baker Mayfield is a known commodity.

***

### Cardinals +1

***

I say the Cardinals are being underrated here largely because of their sorry performance last week against the Rams. The reality is that Arizona was able to move the ball steadily against the Rams, but they just couldn't finish. Kyler Murray lacked that clutch mentality needed to finish drives in the end zone. Even against the Raiders, it took every trick in the book to steal the win away at the end.

Even though Arizona has issues finishing drives, I expect better results here simply because he'll have more opportunities to matriculate the ball downfield thanks to Baker Mayfield playing hopelessly. As long as the Cardinals defense can force enough short drives from the Panthers, Kyler has no reason not to pin up points here.

### Rams @ 49ers (-1.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Rams - 2W  
49ers - 1L

##### _Injuries_

The Rams are starting to lose some pieces along the wings now that cornerback Troy Hill and wide receiver Van Jefferson have been shifted over to injured reserve.

The injuries are adding up for San Francisco too. Azeez Al-Shaair will be missed for several weeks and Arik Armstead's status remains uncertain. Perhaps most scary is the loss of Trent Williams for the season. Good thing the Rams don't have a dominant edge rusher... 

##### _Weather_

Beautiful San Francisco weather

##### _History_

San Francisco seems to have had the Rams number the past couple years. Yes, Los Angeles was finally able to win one over them in the conference championship last year, but second rematches are always difficult affairs for teams that have won the first two matches. On top of that, collapsing in the playoffs has become a hallmark of Kyle Shanahan's coaching career, going back to his days in Atlanta - it really shouldn't have been much of a surprise to see the 49ers choke away the lead in the fourth quarter.

***

### 49ers -1.5

***

I'm banking on history repeating itself here. Even though the defensive brain trust over in Los Angeles has keyed in on some of San Francisco's tendencies, the reality is that Kyle has reliably won these games against his protege going back the past couple years. It's odd too, considering Los Angeles follows a philosophy on defense designed to counter the type of zone-running concepts Kyle employs on offense. And yet, the 49ers almost always manage to dominate these games against their rival Rams.

On top of that, the Rams haven't really impressed me this year. It's clear Matthew Stafford is regressing pretty badly. Outside of Cooper Kupp, nobody else among the skill players have stepped up as reliable producers, although Cam Akers may have had a breakout game last week.
