All right, so last week was better. One thing I learned - I wish I railed against the Chargers. I was worried Los Angeles would pull off some magic now that their quarterback was hobbled and everybody was betting against them. But the Chargers don't really have the coaching necessary to pull off that feat. If anything, Jacksonville has established the legitimacy of their coaching staff with this road win. Congratulations to the Jaguars for finally finding some stability in that aspect.

Also, never trust Carson Wentz against a good team, period. It was only a matter of time before Wentz would humiliate the team and it came much sooner than expected. Washington may well have the league's worst offense when all is said and done this season.

Also, one word about the Buccaneers - the offense is worthless without its receiving weapons. I'm not sure if Brady has more say over the way things are run on that side of the ball now that Bruce Arians is no longer head coach, but the unwillingness to run the ball and incorporate Leonard Fournette in schemed plays seriously worries me. Brady and the brain trust down in Tampa were fully aware that the club was down some critical weaponry in the passing game, yet it's clear their strategy to win on offense started first and foremost by establishing the pass with their limited firepower. I'm really disappointed in them.
