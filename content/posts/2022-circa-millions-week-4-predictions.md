All right, so last week was better. One thing I learned - I wish I railed against the Chargers. I was worried Los Angeles would pull off some magic now that their quarterback was hobbled and everybody was betting against them. But the Chargers don't really have the coaching necessary to pull off that feat. If anything, Jacksonville has established the legitimacy of their coaching staff with this road win. Congratulations to the Jaguars for finally finding some stability in that aspect.

Also, never trust Carson Wentz against a good team, period. It was only a matter of time before Wentz would humiliate the team and it came much sooner than expected. Washington may well have the league's worst offense when all is said and done this season.

Also, one word about the Buccaneers - the offense is worthless without its receiving weapons. I'm not sure if Brady has more say over the way things are run on that side of the ball now that Bruce Arians is no longer head coach, but the unwillingness to run the ball and incorporate Leonard Fournette in schemed plays seriously worries me. Brady and the brain trust down in Tampa were fully aware that the club was down some critical weaponry in the passing game, yet it's clear their strategy to win on offense started first and foremost by establishing the pass with their limited firepower. I'm really disappointed in them.

These two danced a couple years ago in the playoffs. Even though the score would suggest neither team really impressed, the reality was that Buffalo restrained Lamar Jackson from running wild on them. On top of that, the Bills also concentrated their pass coverage on the middle of the field, forcing Lamar to have to throw outside the numbers in order to generate any production through the air. At the time, Lamar wasn't able to make those types of passes.

Not all too comfortable siding with Buffalo here given Lamar's been playing at a high level. But Baltimore's defense is very much a work-in-progress under Mike Macdonald. Miami and New England have exposed some serious flaws with the way that unit operates. I expect Josh Allen to do the same. Buffalo's own defense has issues now that injury is ravaging the secondary, but it should be good enough to limit Lamar in spurts.

Clear and lovely weather

The Texans housed the Chargers last year as double-digit underdogs, thanks to a career game from Rex Burkhead, who gashed the Chargers for big yardage.
