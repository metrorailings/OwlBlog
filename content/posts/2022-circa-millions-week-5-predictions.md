What a lovely week. I went 4-1. My sole loss came from not taking into account that when two teams that aren't division rivals meet again in the span of a year, a change in coordinator may be enough to produce a wildly different result. In the case of my Houston pick not panning out, Pep Hamilton refused to run the ball. In fact, Houston opts to only run the ball a third of the time. Pep stubbornly insisted on sticking with that love of the pass, even when it was the ground game that helped Houston win the game outright as double-digit underdogs against those same Chargers.

So where do we stand now? Well, we have a much better picture of certain teams. My goal now will be to flesh out my spreadsheets highlighting each team's strengths and weaknesses. In doing so, it should be much easier comparing and contrasting two teams in any given match.
