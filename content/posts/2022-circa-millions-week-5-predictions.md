+++
What a lovely week. I went 4-1. My sole loss came from not taking into account that when two teams that aren't division rivals meet again in the span of a year, a change in coordinator may be enough to produce a wildly different result. In the case of my Houston pick not panning out, Pep Hamilton refused to run the ball. In fact, Houston opts to only run the ball a third of the time. Pep stubbornly insisted on sticking with that love of the pass, even when it was the ground game that helped Houston win the game outright as double-digit underdogs against those same Chargers.

So where do we stand now? Well, we have a much better picture of certain teams. My goal now will be to flesh out my spreadsheets highlighting each team's strengths and weaknesses. In doing so, it should be much easier comparing and contrasting two teams in any given match.

***

### Seahawks @ Saints (-5.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Seahawks - 1W  
Saints - 3L

The Saints are reeling after losing a close one in London. Meanwhile, Seattle is on a bit of a high after a phenomenal outing from the offense against Detroit.

##### _Injuries_

It's doubtful Jameis Winston will play. And even if he does, the fractures in his back will likely hinder him, as those don't go away so quickly. Michael Thomas and free safety PJ Williams may not make it either.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

Both these teams met last year what was a pretty low-scoring affair. It was a weird game too, considering the way both teams scored their respective touchdown - Geno Smith threw a long bomb to DK Metcalf who managed to elude two defenders while New Orleans struck gold off an aborted snap. 

***

### Seahawks (+5.5)

***

This line is too good to be true. I'm not sure why either. Last year when these two danced, the Saints were favored by a point less. That Saints club was arguably better too, with Jameis Winston under center and Alvin Kamara operating in top form. I question whether New Orleans can experience the same success with Andy Dalton at the helm and their receiving corps led by a rookie in Chris Olave and a young gun in Marquez Callaway.  

New Orleans has an emotional edge here given their losing streak and Seattle's statement win over the Lions. Is that enough to justify such a wide spread? I don't think so.

### Texans @ Jaguars (-7)

***

##### _Streaks_

Texans - 3L  
Jaguars - 1L

Houston is trying to take back its throne as the worst team in the league. The Jaguars, meanwhile, have been doing well, despite a loss against the Eagles last year up in Philadelphia.

##### _Injuries_

Foley Fatukasi is out for the Jaguars, meaning that rushing defense is not operating anywhere close to full strength. Houston should find some opportunity to be able to run the ball here.

##### _Weather_

Good weather, although some humidity is expected. Houston should be used to the humidity though.

##### _History_

The Texans swept the Jaguars last year, but keep in mind that Jaguars team was led by an entirely different set of coaches.

***

### Jaguars -7

***

Sometimes coaches can make all the difference in the world in these matches. Even though Houston housed Jacksonville twice last season, the coaching circumstances are drastically different now. Houston's arguably lost some potency on offense now that Pep Hamilton's calling plays on that side of the ball. Meanwhile, Jacksonville has ascended to a new level after Doug Pederson and his coaching staff transformed the offense and defense to play a style of football better suited to their talents.

Will that be enough to cover such a wide spread? I'm betting yes. Jacksonville's west-coast style offense is exactly the kind of offense that can expose Lovie Smith's undisciplined defense. On top of that, Houston seems to struggle against opposing rushers, which plays well for a Jaguars outfit committed to maintaining an even balance between runs and passes.

Defensively too, Jacksonville's complex defensive schemes should be enough to keep Davis Mills from really popping off. In fact, Houston's pass-heavy offense plays right into the strengths of this Jaguars defense considering Mike Caldwell prefers dedicating more resources to coverage.

### Bengals @ Ravens (-3.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Bengals - 1W  
Ravens - 1L

Cincinnati's coming off a decent primetime win while Baltimore is still hurting from a last-minute loss to Buffalo at home.

##### _Injuries_

Baltimore could be down a crucial weapon in the passing game in Rashod Bateman. On top of that, their pass rush will take a slight blow now that Justin Houston has been definitively ruled out.

##### _Weather_

Cool fall weather

##### _History_

It seems like the Bengals first started breaking out last year after they so pointedly smashed through these Ravens last year in the first of their two matches. Wink Martindale threw way too many blitzes at Joe Burrow. Maybe back in 2019, that would have worked. But now armed with a true deep threat in Ja'Marr Chase, Burrow was able to carve up the defense en route to a statement win.

The second game yielded similar results, though it's not a fair comparison considering Josh Johnson was quarterbacking for the Ravens offense at the time. 

***

### Bengals +3.5

***

I'll be honest - the Bengals didn't really impress much against the Dolphins. Miami was forced to throw Teddy Bridgewater out there without any real practice. Even still, Cincinnati was a bit fortunate to leave that game with a win.

That being said, I do believe in Lou Anarumo. And I'm banking on this idea that Anarumo could find ways to limit Lamar Jackson the same way Sean McDermott was able to frustrate him last week. Limiting his ability to pass is absolutely key here, as the Ravens seem unwilling to win a game solely by rushing.

On the other side, Joe Burrow should be able to make hay against this underwhelming Mike Macdonald defense. So long as Burrow can keep pace, the cover is always within reach.

***

### Eagles @ Cardinals (+5.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Eagles - 4W  
Cardinals - 1W

##### _Injuries_

Jake Elliott is out for the Eagles. Always a little worrying betting on a team missing its place kicker.

The Cardinals will be missing center Rodney Hudson, though Rondale Moore might finally be activated this week.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

Neither of these two teams have any recent history together or with common opponents.

***

### Eagles -5.5

***

It's possible I might shy away from this pick given the Eagles situation at kicker. But it took the Cardinals moving heaven and earth last week to pull a victory in Carolina. It was a sad win too given the Cardinals offense needed over three full quarters to finally run away with the game. It's clear this offense is a shell of what it was last year - just look at Kyler Murray's average intended air yardage on his throws this season. Nobody else in the NFL is throwing shorter than Kyler Murray - it's pretty grim when Baker Mayfield and Daniel Jones are willing to throw the ball deeper than you.

The only way these Cardinals can keep pace with the Eagles is if their defense can hold Philadelphia's offense at bay on the vast majority of its drives. I don't think Vance Joseph's capable of drawing up a game plan to do just that. Maybe I'm wrong about him....but after watching Mahomes shred his unit in week one, I'm going to side with the hottest team in the league, even if that club is missing its field goal kicker.

***

### Cowboys @ Rams (-5.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Cowboys - 3W  
Rams - 1L

The Cowboys have been on a hot streak with Cooper Rush at the helm of the offense while the Rams suffered an embarrassing loss in primetime last week.

##### _Injuries_

Dallas might be missing the services of star receiver CeeDee Lamb.

The Rams might find themselves thin in the secondary with one starting safety out and another dealing with rib injuries all week.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

Neither of these two teams have any recent history together or with common opponents.
