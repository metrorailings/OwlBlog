What a lovely week. I went 4-1. My sole loss came from not taking into account that when two teams that aren't division rivals meet again in the span of a year, a change in coordinator may be enough to produce a wildly different result. In the case of my Houston pick not panning out, Pep Hamilton refused to run the ball. In fact, Houston opts to only run the ball a third of the time. Pep stubbornly insisted on sticking with that love of the pass, even when it was the ground game that helped Houston win the game outright as double-digit underdogs against those same Chargers.

So where do we stand now? Well, we have a much better picture of certain teams. My goal now will be to flesh out my spreadsheets highlighting each team's strengths and weaknesses. In doing so, it should be much easier comparing and contrasting two teams in any given match.

### Seahawks @ Saints (-5.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Seahawks - 1W  
Saints - 3L

The Saints are reeling after losing a close one in London. Meanwhile, Seattle is on a bit of a high after a phenomenal outing from the offense against Detroit.

##### _Injuries_

It's doubtful Jameis Winston will play. And even if he does, the fractures in his back will likely hinder him, as those don't go away so quickly. Michael Thomas and free safety PJ Williams may not make it either.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

Both these teams met last year what was a pretty low-scoring affair. It was a weird game too, considering the way both teams scored their respective touchdown - Geno Smith threw a long bomb to DK Metcalf who managed to elude two defenders while New Orleans struck gold off an aborted snap.

### Seahawks (+5.5)

This line is too good to be true. I'm not sure why either. Last year when these two danced, the Saints were favored by a point less. That Saints club was arguably better too, with Jameis Winston under center and Alvin Kamara operating in top form. I question whether New Orleans can experience the same success with Andy Dalton at the helm and their receiving corps led by a rookie in Chris Olave and a young gun in Marquez Callaway.  

New Orleans has an emotional edge here given their losing streak and Seattle's statement win over the Lions. Is that enough to justify such a wide spread? I don't think so.

### Texans @ Jaguars (-7)

***

##### _Streaks_

Texans - 3L  
Jaguars - 1L

Houston is trying to take back its throne as the worst team in the league. The Jaguars, meanwhile, have been doing well, despite a loss against the Eagles last year up in Philadelphia.

##### _Injuries_

Does it matter?

##### _Weather_

Good weather, although some humidity is expected. Houston should be used to the humidity though.

##### _History_

The Texans swept the Jaguars last year, but keep in mind that Jaguars team was led by an entirely different set of coaches.

### Jaguars -7

Sometimes coaches can make all the difference in the world in these matches. Even though Houston housed Jacksonville twice last season, the coaching circumstances are drastically different now. Houston's arguably lost some potency on offense now that Pep Hamilton's calling plays on that side of the ball. Meanwhile, Jacksonville has ascended to a new level after Doug Pederson and his coaching staff transformed the offense and defense to play a style of football better suited to their talents.
