I'm not sure what to make of last week. Only two picks panned out last week. Two of the wrong picks were toss-ups and the other loss was absolutely...bizarre?  You know...I was honestly convinced I'd net at least four correct picks. But the Jaguars, Seahawks, and Eagles had to all disappoint me.

Seattle was so awful defensively that not only did the mediocre Saints win, but they won while covering a pretty tall spread. Pete Carroll and his Seahawks apparently never witnessed a mobile quarterback before - Taysom Hill tallied up four touchdowns, three of them over ground. The fact that Seattle remained more competitive last year against these same Saints was likely attributed to the fact that Taysom Hill was missing in action at the time. Apparently, Hill playing in that game would have made all the difference in the world, as Carroll's defense has never seen a quarterback with quick feet. Damn shame too considering Geno Smith had another career outing this week.

Jacksonville is something I can't quite explain. Despite the Jaguars being so much more productive offensively against Houston, the end zone may as well have been nothing but a dream for them - Jacksonville couldn't even score one measly touchdown against these pathetic Texans. And I'm not sure why. Something is off with Trevor Lawrence and the rest of this Jaguars offense. It's possible some inferiority complex could be at work here given the Texans have been dominating Jacksonville the past several years. But I can't reconcile how this same offensive unit that so surgically ripped apart the Chargers in Los Angeles could fare so poorly against a defense as sad as the one in Houston.

The game in Arizona exposed some of Philadelphia's flaws on both sides of the ball. The lack of short coverage from their base defense as well as Jalen Hurts lack of composure against the blitz actually played all too neatly into Arizona's strengths here. The fact that Arizona lost is....well...it's a testament to how much they suck. But it took an injured place kicker for Philly to escape the game with a win.

So what did I learn from all this? Not sure. The only thing that gracefully sums up everything I mentioned above is that I need to appreciate the finer details while analyzing these games. The only way I can actually capture all these little details neatly is if I can finally finish setting up my team analysis spreadsheets. So let's expedite work on that, shall we?

##### _History_

No relevant history, though it is worth noting that the offensive masterminds behind both teams are brothers. Matt LaFleur was raised more in the McVay school of offense while his brother Mike studied under Kyle Shanahan. Regardless, both of them incorporate similar foundational principles in their respective offenses - zone-running combined with a healthy dose of pre-snap motion and a myriad of different plays being run out of the same offensive alignments.
