I'm not sure what to make of last week. Only two picks panned out last week. Two of the wrong picks were toss-ups and the other loss was absolutely...bizarre?  You know...I was honestly convinced I'd net at least four correct picks. But the Jaguars, Seahawks, and Eagles had to all disappoint me.

Seattle was so awful defensively that not only did the mediocre Saints win, but they won while covering a pretty tall spread. Pete Carroll and his Seahawks apparently never witnessed a mobile quarterback before - Taysom Hill tallied up four touchdowns, three of them over ground. The fact that Seattle remained more competitive last year against these same Saints was likely attributed to the fact that Taysom Hill was missing in action at the time. Apparently, Hill playing in that game would have made all the difference in the world, as Carroll's defense has never seen a quarterback with quick feet. Damn shame too considering Geno Smith had another career outing this week.

Jacksonville is something I can't quite explain. Despite the Jaguars being so much more productive offensively against Houston, the end zone may as well have been nothing but a dream for them - Jacksonville couldn't even score one measly touchdown against these pathetic Texans. And I'm not sure why. Something is off with Trevor Lawrence and the rest of this Jaguars offense. It's possible some inferiority complex could be at work here given the Texans have been dominating Jacksonville the past several years. But I can't reconcile how this same offensive unit that so surgically ripped apart the Chargers in Los Angeles could fare so poorly against a defense as sad as the one in Houston.

The game in Arizona exposed some of Philadelphia's flaws on both sides of the ball. The lack of short coverage from their base defense as well as Jalen Hurts lack of composure against the blitz actually played all too neatly into Arizona's strengths here. The fact that Arizona lost is....well...it's a testament to how much they suck. But it took an injured place kicker for Philly to escape the game with a win.

So what did I learn from all this? Not sure. The only thing that gracefully sums up everything I mentioned above is that I need to appreciate the finer details while analyzing these games. The only way I can actually capture all these little details neatly is if I can finally finish setting up my team analysis spreadsheets. So let's expedite work on that, shall we?

### Ravens @ Giants (+5)

##### _Streaks_

Ravens - 1W  
Giants - 2W

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Seasonal fall weather

##### _History_

Interestingly enough, these two organizations danced two years ago. Even though the coaching staffs differed considerably, it was still Daniel Jones and Lamar helming the offenses for New York and Baltimore respectively. Baltimore dominated that game in every single aspect imaginable.

A much more salient point is to be made here - the current Giants defensive coordinator used to work for Baltimore in the same capacity just last year. In fact, Wink Martindale has spent the last three years practicing against Baltimore's style of offense.

### Giants +5.5

Yep

### Jets @ Packers (-7)

***

##### _Streaks_

Jets - 2W  
Packers - 1L

Packers are coming off a humiliating loss to an underrated Giants team while the Jets are somewhat buoyant after winning two games as outright underdogs. To be fair though, both of those wins came against rookie quarterbacks who were essentially thrust into action without much preparation.

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Cold, slightly windy, and strangely humid

##### _History_

No relevant history, though it is worth noting that the offensive masterminds behind both teams are brothers. Matt LaFleur was raised more in the McVay school of offense while his brother Mike studied under Kyle Shanahan. Regardless, both of them incorporate similar foundational principles in their respective offenses - zone-running combined with a healthy dose of pre-snap motion and a myriad of different plays being run out of relatively few offensive alignments.

### Packers -7

The Green Bay Packers aren't even that good of a team. So for them to be deserving as such massive favorites needs to be questioned immediately.

But the thing is that the Packers have so much in their favor this week - home field advantage, an emotional edge now that people are questioning their competence, a better roster, and a superior quarterback. It's possible Mike LaFleur could surprise me here with an impressive game plan against a Green Bay defense known to prioritize coverage above everything else, but watching the Jets last week, it appears to me that LaFleur's unit is still a little shaky at the pass game. In fact, it was a surprise performance from Breece Hall that actually catapulted these Jets to such a dominant win last week. Luckily for Hall, Green Bay's defense has shown a noted vulnerability to opposing rushers, but given the embarrassing loss last week, I suspect Joe Barry will adjust his defensive scheme to keep Hall from popping off. 

If Barry can stifle Breece Hall and Michael Carter, it's hard for me to see Zach Wilson sustain any real production against a Green Bay defense given their zeal for dime packages.
