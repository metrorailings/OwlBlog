I'm not sure what to make of last week. Only two picks panned out last week. Two of the wrong picks were toss-ups and the other loss was absolutely...bizarre?  You know...I was honestly convinced I'd net at least four correct picks. But the Jaguars, Seahawks, and Eagles had to all disappoint me.

Seattle was so awful defensively that not only did the mediocre Saints win, but they won while covering a pretty tall spread. Pete Carroll and his Seahawks apparently never witnessed a mobile quarterback before - Taysom Hill tallied up four touchdowns, three of them over ground. The fact that Seattle remained more competitive last year against these same Saints was likely attributed to the fact that Taysom Hill was missing in action at the time. Apparently, Hill playing in that game would have made all the difference in the world, as Carroll's defense has never seen a quarterback with quick feet. Damn shame too considering Geno Smith had another career outing this week.

Jacksonville is something I can't quite explain. Despite the Jaguars being so much more productive offensively against Houston, the end zone may as well have been nothing but a dream for them - Jacksonville couldn't even score one measly touchdown against these pathetic Texans. And I'm not sure why. Something is off with Trevor Lawrence and the rest of this Jaguars offense. It's possible some inferiority complex could be at work here given the Texans have been dominating Jacksonville the past several years. But I can't reconcile how this same offensive unit that so surgically ripped apart the Chargers in Los Angeles could fare so poorly against a defense as sad as the one in Houston.

The game in Arizona exposed some of Philadelphia's flaws on both sides of the ball. The lack of short coverage from their base defense as well as Jalen Hurts lack of composure against the blitz actually played all too neatly into Arizona's strengths here. The fact that Arizona lost is....well...it's a testament to how much they suck. But it took an injured place kicker for Philly to escape the game with a win.

So what did I learn from all this? Not sure. The only thing that gracefully sums up everything I mentioned above is that I need to appreciate the finer details while analyzing these games. The only way I can actually capture all these little details neatly is if I can finally finish setting up my team analysis spreadsheets. So let's expedite work on that, shall we?

***

### Ravens @ Giants (+5.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Ravens - 1W  
Giants - 2W

##### _Injuries_

Baltimore is once again missing their top receiver in Rashod Bateman as well as a solid pass rusher in Justin Houston. Ben Cleveland will also be missing time here.

The Giants are missing a few pieces in their defensive back seven, but nothing too significant. 

##### _Weather_

Seasonal fall weather

##### _History_

Interestingly enough, these two organizations danced two years ago. Even though the coaching staffs differed in significant ways, it was still Daniel Jones and Lamar helming the offenses for New York and Baltimore respectively. Baltimore dominated that game in every single aspect imaginable.

But here's a more salient point - the current Giants defensive coordinator used to work for Baltimore in the same capacity just one year ago. In fact, Wink Martindale has spent the last three years practicing against against Lamar and Baltimore's offense under Greg Roman.

***

### Giants +5.5

***

Call me biased, but I think New York has definitively proven itself a good team, even if it's passing game leaves something to be desired. So to be given this many points on your home turf is a little insulting, no? 

But besides home field, the Giants have one other critical advantage in their favor - a defensive coordinator who understands better than any other defensive mind Greg Roman's philosophy of offense. Even though New York's given him considerably less talent than whatever Baltimore gave him in years past, the past few weeks have convinced me Martindale's still able to field a very competent defense. So in spite of the injury bug running through the defense currently, I expect Martindale will have his men prepared to handle all the various ways the Ravens can motivate the ball down the field.

***

### Jets @ Packers (-7)

***

##### _Streaks_

Jets - 2W  
Packers - 1L

Packers are coming off a humiliating loss to an underrated Giants team while the Jets are somewhat buoyant after winning two games as outright underdogs. To be fair though, both of those wins came against rookie quarterbacks who were essentially thrust into action without much preparation.

##### _Injuries_

The only concerning injury is Rashan Gary. Gary was able to practice in a limited fashion this week, but a toe injury might limit his production this Sunday.

##### _Weather_

Cold, slightly windy, and strangely humid

##### _History_

No relevant history, though it is worth noting that the offensive masterminds behind both teams are brothers. Matt LaFleur was raised more in the McVay school of offense while his brother Mike studied under Kyle Shanahan. Regardless, both of them incorporate similar foundational principles in their respective offenses - zone-running combined with a healthy dose of pre-snap motion and a myriad of different plays being run out of relatively few offensive alignments. 

***

### Packers -7

***

The Green Bay Packers aren't even that good of a team. So for them to be deserving as such massive favorites needs to be questioned immediately.

But the thing is that the Packers have so much in their favor this week - home field advantage, an emotional edge now that people are questioning their competence, a better roster, and a superior quarterback. It's possible Mike LaFleur could surprise me here with an impressive game plan against a Green Bay defense known to prioritize coverage above everything else, but watching the Jets last week, it looks to me that LaFleur's unit is still a little shaky at the pass game. In fact, it was a surprise performance from Breece Hall that actually catapulted these Jets to such a dominant win last week. Luckily for Hall, Green Bay's defense has shown a noted vulnerability to opposing rushers, but given the embarrassing loss last week, I suspect Joe Barry will adjust his defensive scheme to keep Hall from popping off. 

If Barry can stifle Breece Hall and Michael Carter, it's hard for me to see Zach Wilson sustain any real production against a coverage-oriented Green Bay defense. 

***

### Patriots @ Browns (-2.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Patriots - 1W  
Browns - 2L

##### _Injuries_

Bailey Zappe may have to start again in place of Mac Jones.

Cleveland will be missing its second best pass rusher in Jadaveon Clowney.

##### _Weather_

Some minor wings, but otherwise pleasant weather

##### _History_

Last year, these two faced off in Foxborough. Belichick and his men absolutely smashed a Browns team led by Baker Mayfield. It's worth noting both Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt were sidelined with injury at the time. So even though coaching staffs hasn't really changed much on both organizations, the fact of the matter is that New England will be contesting Cleveland at full strength here.

***

### Uncertain

***

My initial instinct here was to go with the Patriots. Not only did New England look impressive last week against a hot Detroit offense, but rookie third-string quarterback Bailey Zappe has proven himself capable of managing the offense. Cleveland, on the other hand, hasn't changed its feathers much. On top of that, these Patriots also obliterated the Browns last season when the two met last November.

But a closer look at that game and one realizes that not only was Cleveland down to its third-string halfback, but a wounded Baker Mayfield was leading the offense at the time. The Browns today are in a better situation compared to a year ago. I'm not sure if the same can be said of the Patriots given their situation at passer.

On top of that, New England's run defense needs to be called into question. I know the season is still young, but to be ranked near the bottom in terms of rushing defense DVOA is not reassuring when you're going up against an offense that prides itself on its rushing ability. It's possible the Patriots are being unfairly assessed here considering Belichick's always tinkering with different styles of defense depending on opponent, but it's pretty evident that the defensive line has issues containing opposing rushers - New England's forced the least number of negative runs so far this year.

***

### Panthers @ Rams (-10.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Panthers - 2L  
Rams - 2L

The Panthers were losing so bad that Matt Rhule was fired before the halfway point of the season.

The Rams aren't doing so hot either. With Stafford regressing hard and so many weapons from last year gone, the end result has been a team that's been seriously underwhelming.

##### _Injuries_

With Baker Mayfield finally sidelined with injury, P.J. Walker can now step in and breathe some life back into this offense. But worrying, the Panthers may miss both their starting cornerbacks as well as some depth players in the secondary.

The Rams are remarkably healthy, but it's worth noting Cooper Kupp is dealing with a lingering injury. It's always concerning when the only steady vector of production on your offense may not be playing at full strength.

##### _Weather_

Dome Game

##### _History_

No recent history between the two games, though it's worth noting that both teams have literally just faced the 49ers one week removed from one another. These games don't really tell us much considering San Francisco dominated both teams with little effort.

***

### Panthers +10.5

***

The Rams are too pathetic a team to merit such a huge spread. Granted, the Panthers have been a pretty sorry-ass club in their own right, but in their defense, they've recently broken free of some of the shackles holding them back - with Baker currently on the mend and head coach Matt Rhule and defensive coordinator Phil Snow both fired, these Panthers have some real hope for improvement now. Unlike our boy Baker, P.J. Walker can actually connect on some of the passes he throws towards his receivers. Now McAdoo can throw a wrench into things with his erratic game planning, but it's possible Walker also fits better into his read-option spread offense - I suspect Walker has the mobility to actually execute on those designed quarterback runs that I know McAdoo wants to incorporate in his play-calling. 

***

### Cowboys @ Eagles (-6)

***

##### _Streaks_

Cowboys - 4W  
Eagles - 5W

##### _Injuries_

Dak is still expected to be out, so Cooper Rush will start again. The bigger worries initially were the health of Micah Parsons and DeMarcus Lawrence following their win last week, but it seems both players will participate without any restrictions this Sunday.

Philadelphia seems pretty healthy.

##### _Weather_

Crisp fall weather

##### _History_

Dallas schooled the Eagles both times they faced off last year. But to be fair, the Eagles looked drastically different on offense in their first match. The second match was a complete wash, as the Eagles were resting key players all across their roster. So recent history doesn't serve us well here.

***

### Cowboys +6

***

Part of the reason why this line is inflated is the perception that Cooper Rush is a clear step down from Dak Prescott. I'm not convinced about that. On top of that, Jalen Hurts and his composure against pressure needs to be questioned. I know quarterbacks almost always perform worse under duress, but Jalen in particular really suffers. Perhaps I'm not reading him correctly, but I do think Dallas can fluster Jalen enough. On the other side, I expect Cooper, Zeke, and Tony Pollard to be frustrated as well against Philadelphia's stacked defense, but with the way Jonathan Gannon organizes this defense, I do think opportunities are there to move the ball downfield. 

***

### Broncos @ Chargers (-5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Broncos - 2L  
Chargers - 2W

Broncos are reeling bad after such an uninspiring showing from the offense the past two weeks. Russell Wilson in particular has been criticized hard for playing like a clown out there.

##### _Injuries_

It's been "reported" that Russell Wilson is dealing with a muscle injury. Whether the report is actually accurate or planted....well...

Moving on though, two valuable starters for the defense will be out - Josey Jewell and Ronald Darby. Jewell is especially important for his blitzing. There is a possibility Justin Simmons could return from injured reserve.

The place kicker for the Chargers is practicing, albeit in limited fashion, so his game-time availability is not guaranteed. Also worth mentioning that Joey Bosa will be out for at least several weeks.

##### _Weather_

Dome affair

##### _History_

No relevant history to explore here considering this is a new Broncos teams that's markedly different on offense. Even the defense is different now that the team has two premiere pass rushers lining up at the bookends of the trenches.

***

### Broncos +5

***

It disgusts me a little to take this Broncos team on the road against an elite quarterback. But the reality is that this number is a bit inflated following their horrendous outing last game. Denver actually has some redeeming aspects. On top of that, it's not like this Charger team is loaded with so much more talent or coaching prowess - if anything, it can be argued Denver's coaches are a bit better considering Ejiro Evero's start to his young career as a defensive play-caller. 

It's really a matter of home field advantage and an elite quarterback against an emotionally charged team with an elite defense here. The Chargers should still be favored, but not by more than a field goal.

***

### Cardinals @ Seahawks (+2.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Cardinals - 1L  
Seahawks - 1L

##### _Injuries_

Arizona's expected to miss their top two tailbacks as well as their main kicker. Tragically, Matt Ammendola will be called again to kick field goals.

Seattle's largely healthy.

##### _Weather_

Dome affair

##### _History_

Arizona actually fared well against the Seahawks last year. The last game was a bit of a wash considering it was largely meaningless, so let's focus on the first game (which took place in Seattle). The Cardinals were able to march in there with _Colt McCoy_ and outright dominate the Hawks - they held the ball for roughly 40 minutes. Going through the game logs though, it seems the game was competitive up until the middle of the fourth quarter. Ultimately, Seattle's downfall came because Russell Wilson and the offense were only able to convert 2 of 11 terminal downs, whereas the Cardinals were able to convert half of their third downs.

***

### Uncertain

***

I'm not sure whether I feel comfortable siding with the Seahawks after the way their defense blew chunks last week against Taysom Hill and the Saints - Seattle's defense looked completely hopeless against mobile quarterbacks. It's unlikely the Seahawks will be any better against Kyler Murray.

But Kyler himself has been incredibly disappointing. When he's not running around like a chipmunk, his quarterbacking leaves so much to be desired. On the other side of the field, Geno Smith has been nothing but sensational.

A high-scoring affair is certainly a real possibility here. And if that's the case, all it takes is a fortuitous turnover to settle the outcome.
