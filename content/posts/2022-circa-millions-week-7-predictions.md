Professional football is a difficult sport to predict. I can't put it any simpler than that. 

Carolina Panthers was a pick I do not regret making. The cover was in reach too towards the end, once Jacob Eason was called in relief duty. Still....I never could have predicted the offense being so dead under PJ Walker. I mean...look at this shit.

Ben McAdoo is undoubtedly a white-chip coach. I could never imagine a passing offense this worthless. I know the Rams have a top-flight defense, but to not even try and press the ball downfield....it's odd.

The Browns were a legitimately bad pick. It was pretty foolish of me to doubt Belichick and his defense, especially on the eve of his tying George Halas as the second winningest coach of all-time.
