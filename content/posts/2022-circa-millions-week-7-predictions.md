Professional football is a difficult sport to predict. I can't put it any simpler than that.

Carolina Panthers was a pick I do not regret making. The cover was in reach too towards the end, once Jacob Eason was called in relief duty. Still....I never could have predicted the offense being so dead under PJ Walker. I mean...look at this shit.

Ben McAdoo is undoubtedly a white-chip coach. I could never imagine a passing offense this worthless. I know the Rams have a top-flight defense, but to not even try and press the ball downfield....it's odd. I've never seen quarterbacks suck this hard since Jeff Fischer's days with the Rams. The offensive coaches working behind the scenes for the Panthers are some of the most incompetent in the league.

The Browns were a legitimately bad pick. It was pretty foolish of me to doubt Belichick and his defense, especially on the eve of his tying George Halas as the second winningest coach of all-time. I thought Cleveland could ignite its powerful ground game against a New England defense that has yet to impress against the run this season. Instead, the Patriots were phenomenal shutting down their ground game, forcing Jacoby Brissett to assume the mantle of production on offense. Brissett couldn't really do much, especially with the limited weaponry at his disposal.

The Cowboys were another unfortunate pick. I didn't realize the Eagles were so emotionally hyped entering the game. Just watching Nick Sirianni on the sideline, it was clearly evident that this game meant the world to Philadelphia. Honestly, they weren't even that impressive, but the atmosphere and the emotional edge gave them just enough juice to cover the spread here.

So here we are. What can I do to be better here? I have no idea. I need to take more chances on underdogs, knowing full well the defining theme in this league has always been parity. The Steelers, Falcons, and Broncos were always three possible picks in the back of my mind, but I couldn't find the courage to side with any of them last week. That won't happen again.

### Giants @ Jaguars (-3)

Giants - 3W  
Jaguars - 3L

Hot and extremely humid

Neither of these two organization nor their quarterbacks/coaches have faced off against one another.

I know oddsmakers tend to look down on the Giants due to their low yards per play and the inconsistent nature of their offense. But New York is a hot team for good reason. Not only do they not make many errors, their creative playmaking and their clutch mentality lends itself incredibly well to comebacks.

The same can't be said of Jacksonville. In the last three games alone, they've either given up game-winning scores late or lost after accumulating double-digit leads. It's clear the team's missing that killer instinct needed to carry leads all the way to the finish line - in fact, few stats illustrate this better than their pathetic fourth-down conversion rate.  

Even if the Jaguars garner a lead (which I expect), I do see the Giants try and staging a comeback here. It's very possible that New York can outright win the game here despite the stifling humidity. I mean....for one thing, Jacksonville's offense presents some limitations in its implementation of Doug Pederson's west-coast style offense. The passing game is largely predicated on routes designed to manufacture space in the short field. It's not a passing attack designed to overcome negative game script, especially given that none of the Jaguar receivers have really stood out as reliable vectors.

If Jacksonville is to win this game, it'd be on the strength of its ground game, led by Travis Etienne. If Jacksonville can stay committed to rushing the ball, the Giants defense will start wearing down from the humidity. So that does concern me.

### Browns @ Ravens (-6.5)

##### _Streaks_

Browns - 3L  
Ravens - 1W

##### _Injuries_

Hopefully, Rashod Bateman comes back for these Ravens. Baltimore desperately needs more weapons in the passing game.

##### _Weather_

Temperate with some humidity

##### _History_

Only their first match from last year is worth exploring here, as that was the match with Lamar active. That match was a very low-scoring affair relative to expectations. Looking at the gamebook, I can see that the Ravens only managed to push the ball into the end zone once, though they came close a second time. Cleveland did manage to pick off Lamar twice, but neither of those interceptions meant much considering the Browns couldn't sustain much over ground.

### Uncertain

It's tempting to side with Baltimore here. Going by last year's game alone, this Ravens defense has already demonstrated itself more than capable of shanking Cleveland's ground game. Just last week alone, Saquon Barkley had a rough time getting going against these same Raven defenders.

That being said, I see this Cleveland defense has a beat on Greg Roman's offense. The fact that they were able to stunt Lamar and company on most of their drives last year leaves me a bit wary. By and large, nothing much has changed for either team since then. I know Jacoby Brissett is now the quarterback for the Browns, but it's not like he's a downgrade from Baker.
