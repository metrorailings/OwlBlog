Professional football is a difficult sport to predict. I can't put it any simpler than that.

Carolina Panthers was a pick I do not regret making. The cover was in reach too towards the end, once Jacob Eason was called in relief duty. Still....I never could have predicted the offense being so dead under PJ Walker. I mean...look at this shit.

Ben McAdoo is undoubtedly a white-chip coach. I could never imagine a passing offense this worthless. I know the Rams have a top-flight defense, but to not even try and press the ball downfield....it's odd. I've never seen quarterbacks suck this hard since Jeff Fischer's days with the Rams. The offensive coaches working behind the scenes for the Panthers are some of the most incompetent in the league.

The Browns were a legitimately bad pick. It was pretty foolish of me to doubt Belichick and his defense, especially on the eve of his tying George Halas as the second winningest coach of all-time. I thought Cleveland could ignite its powerful ground game against a New England defense that has yet to impress against the run this season. Instead, the Patriots were phenomenal shutting down their ground game, forcing Jacoby Brissett to assume the mantle of production on offense. Brissett couldn't really do much, especially with the limited weaponry at his disposal.

The Cowboys were another unfortunate pick. I didn't realize the Eagles were so emotionally hyped entering the game. Just watching Nick Sirianni on the sideline, it was clearly evident that this game meant the world to Philadelphia. Honestly, they weren't even that impressive, but the atmosphere and the emotional edge gave them just enough juice to cover the spread here.

So here we are. What can I do to be better here? I have no idea. I need to take more chances on underdogs, knowing full well the defining theme in this league has always been parity. The Steelers, Falcons, and Broncos were always three possible picks in the back of my mind, but I couldn't find the courage to side with any of them last week. That won't happen again.
