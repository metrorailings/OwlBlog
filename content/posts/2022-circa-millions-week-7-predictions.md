Professional football is a difficult sport to predict. I can't put it any simpler than that.

Carolina Panthers was a pick I do not regret making. The cover was in reach too towards the end, once Jacob Eason was called in relief duty. Still....I never could have predicted the offense being so dead under PJ Walker. I mean...look at this shit.

Ben McAdoo is undoubtedly a white-chip coach. I could never imagine a passing offense this worthless. I know the Rams have a top-flight defense, but to not even try and press the ball downfield....it's odd. I've never seen quarterbacks suck this hard since Jeff Fischer's days with the Rams. The offensive coaches working behind the scenes for the Panthers are some of the most incompetent in the league.

The Browns were a legitimately bad pick. It was pretty foolish of me to doubt Belichick and his defense, especially on the eve of his tying George Halas as the second winningest coach of all-time. I thought Cleveland could ignite its powerful ground game against a New England defense that has yet to impress against the run this season. Instead, the Patriots were phenomenal shutting down their ground game, forcing Jacoby Brissett to assume the mantle of production on offense. Brissett couldn't really do much, especially with the limited weaponry at his disposal.

The Cowboys were another unfortunate pick. I didn't realize the Eagles were so emotionally hyped entering the game. Just watching Nick Sirianni on the sideline, it was clearly evident that this game meant the world to Philadelphia. Honestly, they weren't even that impressive, but the atmosphere and the emotional edge gave them just enough juice to cover the spread here.

So here we are. What can I do to be better here? I have no idea. I need to take more chances on underdogs, knowing full well the defining theme in this league has always been parity. The Steelers, Falcons, and Broncos were always three possible picks in the back of my mind, but I couldn't find the courage to side with any of them last week. That won't happen again.

### Giants @ Jaguars (-3)

***

##### _Streaks_

Giants - 3W  
Jaguars - 3L

The Giants have been absolutely hot. The Jaguars, on the other hand...not so much after Trevor Lawrence started bragging about their success.

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Hot and extremely humid

##### _History_

Neither of these two organization nor their quarterbacks/coaches have faced off against one another.

***

### Giants +3

***

I know oddsmakers tend to look down on the Giants due to their low yards per play and the inconsistent nature of their offense. But New York is a hot team for good reason. Not only do they not make many errors, their creative playmaking and their clutch mentality lends itself incredibly well to comebacks.

The same can't be said of Jacksonville. In the last three games alone, they've either given up game-winning scores late or lost after accumulating double-digit leads. It's clear the team's missing that killer instinct needed to carry leads all the way to the finish line - in fact, few stats illustrate this better than their pathetic fourth-down conversion rate.

Even if the Jaguars garner a lead (which I expect), I do see the Giants try and staging a comeback here. It's very possible that New York can outright win the game here despite the stifling humidity. I mean....for one thing, Jacksonville's offense presents some limitations in its implementation of Doug Pederson's west-coast style offense. The passing game is largely predicated on routes designed to manufacture space in the short field. It's not a passing attack designed to overcome negative game script, especially given that none of the Jaguar receivers have really stood out as reliable vectors.

If Jacksonville is to win this game, it'd be on the strength of its ground game, led by Travis Etienne. If Jacksonville can stay committed to rushing the ball, the Giants defense will start wearing down from the humidity. So that does concern me.

### Browns @ Ravens (-6.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Browns - 3L  
Ravens - 1L

These poor Browns cannot catch a win. Two close losses followed by a humiliating blowout last week at the hands of the Patriots. The Ravens are reeling too from blowing yet another game in the fourth quarter this year.

##### _Injuries_

Hopefully, Rashod Bateman comes back for these Ravens. Baltimore desperately needs more weapons in the passing game.

##### _Weather_

Temperate with some humidity

##### _History_

Only their first match from last year is worth exploring here, as that was the match with Lamar active. That match was a very low-scoring affair relative to expectations. Looking at the gamebook, I can see that the Ravens only managed to push the ball into the end zone once, though they came close a second time. Cleveland did manage to pick off Lamar twice, but neither of those interceptions meant much considering the Browns couldn't sustain much over ground.

***

### Uncertain

***

It's tempting to side with Baltimore here. Going by last year's game alone, this Ravens defense has already demonstrated itself more than capable of shanking Cleveland's ground game. Just last week alone, Saquon Barkley had a rough time getting going against these same Raven defenders.

That being said, I see this Cleveland defense has a beat on Greg Roman's offense. The fact that they were able to stunt Lamar and company on most of their drives last year leaves me a bit wary. By and large, nothing much has changed for either team since then. Baltimore's defense hasn't transformed much despite their change at coordinator. And Jacoby Brissett isn't much of a downgrade or upgrade over Baker. So I don't see why Baltimore would suddenly have an easier time posting up points here in this rematch.

### Falcons @ Bengals (-6.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Falcons - 1W  
Bengals - 1W

Both teams are coming off impressive wins given their recent struggles.

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Lovely weather for football

##### _History_

Unfortunately, no recent history between these two clubs or their coaching staffs.

***

### Falcons +6.5

***

Call me crazy, but I'm liking this Falcons team. Everybody knows they want to run the ball, yet they still find ways to run the ball. Just like Lamar, Marcus Mariota's added an invaluable dimension on offense that makes everything just work. Even with defenders loaded into the box, these Falcons **will** run the ball, full stop. By the way, just a brief note on Marcus Mariota...the man's been rejuvenated playing in this offense. His passes are much more crisp too, even though his weapons may be limited.

The defense concerns me. Even though Dean Pees is renowned for being a defensive mastermind of yore, I just find his unit underwhelming. Maybe it's the lack of pass rushers or the talent missing in the backfield, but I expected more given Dean Pees and his pedigree.

That being said, it doesn't take much talent to actually limit Cincinnati on offense - all it takes is a commitment to keeping two safeties deep. Even if it makes the defense a bit predictable, the Bengals have serious issue maintaining production against this coverage. Joe Burrow is so habituated to throwing the ball deep that taking away those opportunities leaves him impotent. The Bengals tried to compensate by running the ball with Joe Mixon, but I think Zac Taylor's given up on that recently - just last week, Cincinnati's pass/run ratio was nearly 4 to 1.

So can Dean Pees construct a game plan to handcuff Joe Burrow and the passing game? I'm not sure just yet. I think Pees has a habit of mixing up coverages in order to confuse his opponent. Will that work against Burrow?

### Packers @ Commanders (+5.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Packers - 2L  
Commanders - 1W

Green Bay is coming off two shameful losses. A reckoning is taking place in Wisconsin as we speak. A third loss against the Commanders and I wouldn't be surprised to see some heads on pikes here.

##### _Injuries_

With Randall Cobb lost for the season, Aaron Rodgers is now missing one of his most trusted weapons on offense.

##### _Weather_

Cool weather

##### _History_

These two teams fought one another last year. Even though Washington performed well enough for about three quarters, the Packers finally found enough juice to run away with the lead and nail the 8-point cover at home.

***

### Uncertain

***

So a few things are different with this game compared to the last. One, Washington is playing on their home turf. Two, Green Bay is down its most significant weapon on offense. Three, their offensive line has become appreciably worse. Is this enough for Washington to not only cover, but maybe win? I don't know. Green Bay is playing with an emotional edge now that they've been embarrassed two weeks in a row against perceivably lesser teams.

It helps that neither side has much of a coaching advantage. That being said, these Packers are notably weak against opposing rushers, but Washington is one of the worst teams in the league at running the ball. Generally, Washington passes the ball twice every time it runs.

Taylor Heinecke is a better quarterback compared to Carson Wentz, but how much better? Whatever magic he may have harbored fizzled out quick last year.

### Buccaneers @ Panthers (+10.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Buccaneers - 1L  
Panthers - 3L

Carolina did not start things well in the post-Rhule era.

##### _Injuries_

##### _Weather_

Beautiful weather fit for spring

##### _History_

Twice last year, these two danced. Tampa Bay dominated both matches by more than 20-point margins.

***

### Buccaneers -10.5

***

I may shy away from this pick closer to game time. Taking such a heavy favorite on the road never sits well with me. But the reality is that if the Panthers plan on trotting PJ Walker back out there after seeing how feckless he was last week....I have no hope they'll be able to post points at all. Even with Christian McCaffrey running wild out there, a tailback can only do so much without any help from his quarterback. Walker only has two different throws in his arsenal - throw straight left or throw straight right. It's not enough to win a middle-school game, let alone an NFL one.

Tampa Bay is nowhere as fierce as they may have been last year when many had them ranked as one of the best offenses, but as the Rams so lovingly demonstrated last week, it doesn't take much to house these Panthers.
