+++
Football's such a difficult sport to predict. Two of my picks were solid last week, three were absolute trash. I'm still trying to understand why. The only theme I can pick out this week is a simple one - winners continue winning while losers continue losing.

The Buccaneers lost against an even bigger loser in Carolina. The 49ers lost _horribly_ in a prime spot against the Chiefs - Kansas absolutely sliced up their defense. Quarterback pressure might as well been an alien concept to these 49ers. The Raiders coming off two impressive showings took some time to settle back into their groove, but once that happened, Vegas mowed over that pathetic Texans defense.

On top of that, the Jets continue winning despite their sad offense. Green Bay continues finding new ways losing in humiliating fashion. Tennessee still wins despite purely having a management philosophy on offense. Seattle won convincingly against a shaky Chargers team. Giants once again found a way to win in enemy territory.

Sharps were humiliated. As was the public. But if one simply looked at the outcomes last week and bet the winners from those games, chances are that person would be sitting here incredibly happy right now.

So what does that tell me? I don't know. Usually, parity is a rule of thumb in the NFL - the low scoring this season actually reflects that principle well. But it seems that the teams trending downward over the past couple weeks are still falling further and faster down that cliff. Meanwhile, the clubs riding high on wins lately continue reaching new heights. What we're seeing here is a gulf - teams with a winning mindset are distancing themselves from those organizations that cannot find the will to win.

The goal, first and foremost, will be to bet on teams with a winner's mentality whenever the situation is favorable for them. Then I'll focus more on underdogs that are facing off against opponents that are overvalued.

### Cardinals @ Vikings (-3.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Cardinals - 1W  
Vikings - 4W (Bye)

Vikings are one of the hottest teams in the NFL, given their record. Arizona's coming off a strong win over the beleaguered Saints.

##### _Injuries_

DeAndre Hopkins returning for Arizona has been big, especially now that Hollywood Brown is out indefinitely. His first game back against the Saints was nothing short of impressive.

Matt Prater is the one injury to watch for these Cardinals, given their sorry situation at kicker.

##### _Weather_

Dome affair

##### _History_

Both these teams faced one another early in the season last year in Arizona. Funnily enough, the spread was the exact same - 3.5 points in favor of the home team. Arizona won a very contested affair, though they needed Greg Joseph to miss an easy field goal at the end of the game.

So since then, what's changed? Well, this Arizona team isn't as hot as they were last year - in fact, Minnesota's the team in this match carrying heat. Furthermore, the entire Vikings coaching staff from last year has been trashed in favor of a new regime led by Kevin O'Connell. The Cardinals are still being led by the same coaches, but some of the impact players from last year are no longer there, namely Chandler Jones.

I feel a little queasy thinking that the Cardinals have a credible shot here. But the reality is this - the Vikings haven't been winning football games on the strength of their offense or a fierce defense. Minnesota has been playing a brand of football focused much more on minimizing mistakes and turnovers. It's good enough to win football games, but not cover spreads. In their last four games, the Vikings have only covered once. And it could be argued that lone cover was owed more to luck considering Minnesota's defense managed to knock Miami's starting quarterback out of the game early.

The 3.5 points here is just enough leeway for Arizona here. Even if the Cardinals lose this game by committing one error too many, they can still nail the cover here. That being said, Arizona's potential to make mistakes here remains uncomfortably high so long as kicker Matt Prater remains sidelined with a hip injury. So Friday's injury report will likely dictate my decision here.

### Raiders @ Saints (+1.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Raiders - 1W  
Saints - 2L

New Orleans is hurting after sustaining two losses in part due to injury.

##### _Injuries_

Maybe this week will be the week Darren Waller finally starts for Vegas.

The key names to watch for New Orleans will be Marshon Lattimore, Michael Thomas, and Jarvis Landry.

##### _Weather_

Dome affair

##### _History_

No recent history between the two organizations, but the Raiders head coaches and the Saints coaches have faced off against one another last year when Patrick Graham was a defensive coordinator with the Giants and Josh McDaniels was still the offensive mastermind behind the Patriots. Neither of those two matches can tell us too much given the massive difference in personnel, but it's worth noting the Saints fared well against the units led by McDaniels and Graham respectively. Then again, McDaniels was working on breaking in a rookie quarterback and Graham was herding a demoralized unit.

### Uncertain

It's easy to look down on the Saints after their painful losses in the past two weeks. But injuries left them rattled entering both those matches. Despite that, New Orleans still remained somewhat competitive, especially against Cincinnati a few weeks ago. And let's not forget that these same Saints were able to win decisively against Seattle, even going as far as covering a pretty wide spread.

Then again, the Raiders have proven to me that they have the mettle to win, considering they boast one of the league's more intricate ground games. That being said, Josh Jacobs will be tested going up against a Saints defensive coaching staff that should understand the type of power running game Josh McDaniels likes to run.
