Football's such a difficult sport to predict. Two of my picks were solid last week, three were absolute trash. I'm still trying to understand why. The only theme I can pick out this week is a simple one - winners continue winning while losers continue losing.

The Buccaneers lost against an even bigger loser in Carolina. The 49ers lost in a prime spot against the Chiefs - Kansas absolutely sliced up their defense. Quarterback pressure might as well been an alien concept to these 49ers. The Raiders coming off two impressive showings took some time to settle back into their groove, but once that happened, Vegas mowed down that pathetic Texans defense.

On top of that, the Jets continue winning despite their sad offense. Green Bay continues finding new ways losing in humiliating fashion. Tennessee still wins despite purely having a management philosophy on offense. Seattle won convincingly against a shaky Chargers team. Giants once again found a way to win in enemy territory.

Sharps were humiliated. As was the public. But if one simply looked at the outcomes last week and bet the winners, chances are that person would be sitting here incredibly happy right now.

So where do I sit?
