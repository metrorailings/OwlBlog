+++
Football's such a difficult sport to predict. Two of my picks were solid last week, three were absolute trash. I'm still trying to understand why. The only theme I can pick out this week is a simple one - winners continue winning while losers continue losing.

The Buccaneers lost against an even bigger loser in Carolina. The 49ers lost _horribly_ in a prime spot against the Chiefs - Kansas absolutely sliced up their defense. Quarterback pressure might as well been an alien concept to these 49ers. The Raiders coming off two impressive showings took some time to settle back into their groove, but once that happened, Vegas mowed over that pathetic Texans defense.

On top of that, the Jets continue winning despite their sad offense. Green Bay continues finding new ways losing in humiliating fashion. Tennessee still wins despite purely having a management philosophy on offense. Seattle won convincingly against a shaky Chargers team. Giants once again found a way to win in enemy territory.

Sharps were humiliated. As was the public. But if one simply looked at the outcomes last week and bet the winners from those games, chances are that person would be sitting here incredibly happy right now.

So what does that tell me? I don't know. Usually, parity is a rule of thumb in the NFL - the low scoring this season actually reflects that principle well. But it seems that the teams trending downward over the past couple weeks are still falling further and faster down that cliff. Meanwhile, the clubs riding high on wins lately continue reaching new heights. What we're seeing here is a gulf - teams with a winning mindset are distancing themselves from those organizations that cannot find the will to win.

The goal, first and foremost, will be to bet on teams with a winner's mentality whenever the situation is favorable for them. Then I'll focus more on underdogs that are facing off against opponents that are overvalued.

### Cardinals @ Vikings (-3.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Cardinals - 1W  
Vikings - 4W (Bye)

Vikings are one of the hottest teams in the NFL, given their record. Arizona's coming off a strong win over the beleaguered Saints.

##### _Injuries_

DeAndre Hopkins returning for Arizona has been big, especially now that Hollywood Brown is out indefinitely. His first game back against the Saints was nothing short of impressive.

Matt Prater is the one injury to watch for these Cardinals, given their sorry situation at kicker.

##### _Weather_

Dome affair

##### _History_

Both these teams faced one another early in the season last year in Arizona. Funnily enough, the spread was the exact same - 3.5 points in favor of the home team. Arizona won a very contested affair, though they needed Greg Joseph to miss an easy field goal at the end of the game.

So since then, what's changed? Well, this Arizona team isn't as hot as they were last year - in fact, Minnesota's the team in this match carrying heat. Furthermore, the entire Vikings coaching staff from last year has been trashed in favor of a new regime led by Kevin O'Connell. The Cardinals are still being led by the same coaches, but some of the impact players from last year are no longer there, namely Chandler Jones.

***

### Uncertain

***

I feel a little queasy thinking that the Cardinals have a credible shot here. But the reality is this - the Vikings haven't been winning football games on the strength of their offense or a fierce defense. Minnesota has been playing a brand of football focused much more on minimizing mistakes and turnovers. It's good enough to win football games, but not cover spreads. In their last four games, the Vikings have only covered once. And it could be argued that lone cover was owed more to luck considering Minnesota's defense managed to knock Miami's starting quarterback out of the game early.

The 3.5 points here is just enough leeway for Arizona here. Even if the Cardinals lose this game by committing one error too many, they can still nail the cover here. That being said, Arizona's potential to make mistakes here remains uncomfortably high so long as kicker Matt Prater remains sidelined with a hip injury. So Friday's injury report will likely dictate my decision here.

***

### Raiders @ Saints (+1.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Raiders - 1W  
Saints - 2L

New Orleans is hurting after sustaining two losses in part due to injury.

##### _Injuries_

Maybe this week will be the week Darren Waller finally starts for Vegas. Then again a bug seems to wreaking havoc across the Raiders locker, although McDaniels has said it shouldn't be any real cause for concern.

The key names to watch for New Orleans will be Marshon Lattimore, Michael Thomas, and Jarvis Landry. None of these players are expected to play.

##### _Weather_

Dome affair

##### _History_

No recent history between the two organizations, but the Raiders head coaches and the Saints coaches have faced off against one another last year when Patrick Graham was a defensive coordinator with the Giants and Josh McDaniels was still the offensive mastermind behind the Patriots. Neither of those two matches can tell us too much given the massive difference in personnel, but it's worth noting the Saints fared well against the units led by McDaniels and Graham respectively. Then again, McDaniels was working on breaking in a rookie quarterback and Graham was herding a demoralized unit.

***

### Uncertain

***

It's easy to look down on the Saints after their painful losses in the past two weeks. But injuries left them rattled entering both those matches. Despite that, New Orleans still remained somewhat competitive, especially against Cincinnati a few weeks ago. And let's not forget that these same Saints were able to win decisively against Seattle, even going as far as covering a pretty wide spread.

Then again, the Raiders have proven to me that they have the mettle to win, considering they boast one of the league's more intricate ground games. That being said, Josh Jacobs will be tested going up against a Saints defensive coaching staff that should understand the type of power running game Josh McDaniels likes to run.

***

### Patriots @ Jets (+2.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Patriots - 1L (MNF)  
Jets - 4W

The Jets are riding high off a four-game streak. Few teams are better cognizant of their own limitations than the Jets.

##### _Injuries_

David Andrews is out for the Patriots, which is a blow to the continuity on their offensive line.

As for the Jets, New York can no longer count on Breece Hall to break off game-changing plays now that he's out for the season. Likewise, Corey Davis will be out as well, though he'll likely return next week.

##### _Weather_

Crisp autumn weather

##### _History_

Last year, New England swept the Jets easy. As Bill Belichick has shown time and time again with other rookie quarterbacks, Zach Wilson isn't ready for the rigors of the professional leagues.

***

### Patriots -2.5

***

Belichick and his defenses notably struggle against defenses with mobile quarterbacks. So New England's loss against Chicago wasn't as shocking as it may have appeared at first. That being said, it was still disappointing, but there's a reason the oddsmakers didn't bother updating this line even in light of New England's humiliating loss.

Luckily for them, the Jets don't have a mobile quarterback. In fact, they have a quarterback they don't even fully trust. New York has been winning games chiefly relying on their defense and their ground game. The ground game will suffer now that Breece Hall has blown out his knee, but the club should still be able to produce some yards regardless.

The key for the Patriots here is whether they can stop New York's tailbacks from popping off and getting into their groove. Zack Wilson has to be forced to carry the burden of production here. Judging by the way Robert Saleh and Mike LaFleur have limited his involvement in the offense, I'm assuming Wilson's not yet capable of carrying this offense should circumstances deem it necessary.

Let me take that back...the real key for the Patriots here is whether they can commit to Bailey Zappe over Mac Jones. Mac is a liability. If Mac was inserted into the top role at offense, then this game becomes a matter of whoever makes the most mistakes. Home field advantage would imply a slight advantage for New York then.

### Steelers @ Eagles (-10.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Steelers - 1L (SNF)  
Eagles - 6W (Bye)

Steelers are coming off a limp primetime loss to Miami.

##### _Injuries_

Pittsburgh could see TJ Watt return this week, though it remains to be seen whether he can play at full strength. What should worry Pittsburgh this week is that their kicker Chris Boswell showed up late on the injury rolls and appears to be questionable. Not good when you have a rookie quarterback shouldering the burden of production going up against one of the hottest teams in the league.

Eagles are very healthy.

##### _Weather_

Friendly fall weather

##### _History_

No relevant history to even consider between the two franchises

***

### Eagles -10.5

***

After getting burned **bad** on a double-digit favorite last week, why would I dip back into this well? Well, it's because the Eagles (along with the Bills) are among the two best teams in the league. If there's any team capable of covering a double-digit spread comfortably, it should be Philadelphia, especially playing at home almost wholly healthy.

Meanwhile, Kenny Pickett is still a project early in development. His ability to overcome adversity is questionable at best. Then again, it's hard to blame the kid considering he's only so many games into his professional career.

The only thing that can stop Philadelphia here is whether they end up losing interest midway through the game. Should that happen, a chance is there that Pittsburgh may nail the back-door cover. A slim chance.

***

### Packers @ Bills (-11)

***

##### _Streaks_

Packers - 3L  
Bills - 3W (Bye)

One loss as a major favorite is worrisome. Two consecutive losses as a significant favorite is genuine cause for concern. Three consecutive losses as a decisive favorite though...it's official - Green Bay is a bad team.

##### _Injuries_

Allen Lazard is very unlikely to play, putting even more strain on an underwhelming Packers receiving corps

##### _Weather_

Expect some cold weather, though it shouldn't be anything that'll hinder either team

##### _History_

No history worthy of analyzing here

***

### Bills +11

***

Yet another double-digit favorite. But if there's any team that can cover such a wide spread, it's undoubtedly the Bills on their own home turf.

That being said, I am aware that Green Bay's stock has plummeted the past few weeks. The Packers are now a team without much to lose. On top of that, I am aware Green Bay still has a few tricks up its sleeve, namely its ground game. For some reason, the Packers have shied away from running the ball during their losing streak. Perhaps this shameful losing streak will be the catalyst for a much-needed shift in offensive philosophy. That being said, will it be enough to help cover the spread here? I'm still not sure. Few teams are better at stonewalling opposing rushers than Buffalo. If the Bills can subvert the growing public narrative and treat these Packers as serious opponents, I do think Buffalo can run away with a huge win here, even if Green Bay surprises people with a shift in mentality.

If this game was played in Wisconsin, I think Green Bay would be a much safer bet. But for the time being, I'll need to side with the winning team certain to ride high on the support of their devoted fans this Sunday night.

### Bengals @ Browns (+3)

***

##### _Streaks_

Bengals - 2W  
Browns - 4L

Cleveland is barely registering a heart beat here after suffering through four consecutive losses.

##### _Injuries_

Ja'Marr Chase is out for the next several weeks for these Bengals, a huge blow considering Cincinnati's offense lives and dies by the big play.

Cleveland will be down without their starting tight end in David Njoku.

##### _Weather_

A lovely day considering we're about to enter November.

##### _History_

Surprisingly...the Browns housed these Bengals twice last year, even though Cincinnati was running hot in spurts.

To be fair, the second game took place between the second-string quarterbacks, so only the first game is worth exploring here. That game was interesting - even though the score would indicate a completely one-sided blowout, the statistics don't necessarily testify to that. Cincinnati dominated time of possession. Cleveland was only successful on roughly 40% of their rushing attempts, though that figure may be exaggerated as the Browns may have been slacking in the fourth quarter after being up by three scores. Cleveland also logged several more penalties compared to the Bengals. On top of that, neither team really impressed on third down. The Browns actually posted 11 fewer

What truly dictated the Browns success in this game was their ability to force multiple turnovers from Cincinnati's offense. Interesting.

***

### Browns +3

***

I'd rather not be taking the Browns here, but I might not have much choice given the lack of options this week.

This year, Cleveland's already had rematches with several opponents they faced last year. Suspiciously enough, the scores and outcomes in those games seem to indicate the Browns haven't changed much. If that trend holds, Cleveland should be able to handle these Bengals fairly easily at home, especially in primetime.

One thing worth noting from that game last year between Burrow and Cleveland's defense - outside of one drive that started with favorable positioning, the Bengals were completely shut out in the second half. It seems to me Joe Woods may have sniffed out something here, possibly the fact that Cincinnati struggles to motion the ball against two-deep coverage. It's a weakness that Baltimore exploited and I wouldn't be surprised if Woods and Cleveland's defensive coaches picked up on that same vulnerability.

***

### 49ers @ Rams (+1.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

49ers - 2L  
Rams - 1W (Bye)

##### _Injuries_

49ers are injured along all lines of their defense. It's worth keeping an eye on their report on Friday to see if any of those key players are returning - Azeez, Arik Armstead, Emmanuel Mosley.

Never mind, not only are neither of those three playing, but Deebo is expected to be sidelined as well. Not good.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _History_

The 49ers have won every single regular season game against these Rams going back to 2018. Kyle Shanahan clearly has a beat on the Rams.

***

### Uncertain

***

History alone would suggest that the 49ers should be the easy choice here, even on the road. But I worry here. Not only has McVay had a full bye week to prepare against his bitter rivals, but lately, I've seen the Rams adopt the same tactics that Kansas City leveraged so successfully against the 49er defense last week, namely sweeps and screens. I suspect McVay will incorporate so much more of these types of plays in the game to keep San Francisco's pass rushers at bay.

If that happens and Jimmy G is unable to get going against the Rams and their elite defense, it's possible Los Angeles might finally win one over their big brother in the regular season.
