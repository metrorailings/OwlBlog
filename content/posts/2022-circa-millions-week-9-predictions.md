Well....I'm done. Last week was another painful loss. But I don't give a damn - I'm going to finish this season trying to go on a multi-week streak here...if only for pride. Well, pride and FanDuel money.

I think I'm at a point where there are no more excuses to not be mostly right. At least 80% of my picks have to be on the money, period. I think I have enough information now to set that goal for myself.

Once again, I need to only bet money on proven winners. If I stayed true to that mantra, I would have avoided picking Las Vegas. Honestly, the Raiders only won my confidence because I thought they've overcome most of their anxiety issues over the past couple weeks after a strong showing against Kansas City in primetime as well as a statement win against Houston. But it's worth noting - the Raiders actually choked away a double-digit lead against those Chiefs. And a dominant win against the Texans really doesn't mean much, I guess...the Titans were able to bowl them over doing nothing but running the ball on offense behind Derrick Henry. It was honestly a shameful showing given it was incredibly obvious Tennessee would be doing nothing but rushing on offense. And the Titans were still able to win comfortably. When you boil everything down, the Raiders are a trash team with so much potential. It's unlikely much of that potential will actually be realized any time soon. What Vegas desperately needs more than anything is for other weapons to step up in the passing game outside of Davonte Adams. 

Another principle I keep learning the hard way - be careful siding with teams that have known inferiority complexes. The Rams once again lost in tragic fashion to their big brother in the 49ers. Unless a team is on the cusp of a major leap forward, be very wary betting on that team.
