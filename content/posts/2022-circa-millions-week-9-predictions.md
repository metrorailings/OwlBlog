Well....I'm done. Last week was another painful loss. But I don't give a damn - I'm going to finish this season trying to go on a multi-week streak here...if only for pride. Well, pride and FanDuel money.

I think I'm at a point where there are no more excuses to not be mostly right. At least 80% of my picks have to be on the money, period. I think I have enough information now to set that goal for myself.

Once again, I need to only bet money on proven winners. If I stayed true to that mantra, I would have avoided picking Las Vegas. Honestly, the Raiders only won my confidence because I thought they've overcome most of their anxiety issues over the past couple weeks after a strong showing against Kansas City in primetime as well as a statement win against Houston. But it's worth noting - the Raiders actually choked away a double-digit lead against those Chiefs. And a dominant win against the Texans really doesn't mean much, I guess...the Titans were able to bowl them over doing nothing but running the ball on offense behind Derrick Henry. It was honestly a shameful showing given it was incredibly obvious Tennessee would be doing nothing but rushing on offense. And the Titans were still able to win comfortably.
