Well....I'm done. Last week was another painful loss. But I don't give a damn - I'm going to finish this season trying to go on a multi-week streak here...if only for pride. Well, pride and FanDuel money.

I think I'm at a point where there are no more excuses to not be mostly right. At least 80% of my picks have to be on the money, period. I think I have enough information now to set that goal for myself.

Once again, I need to only bet money on proven winners. If I stayed true to that mantra, I would have avoided picking Las Vegas. Honestly, the Raiders only won my confidence because I thought they've overcome most of their anxiety issues over the past couple weeks after a strong showing against Kansas City in primetime as well as a statement win against Houston. But it's worth noting - the Raiders actually choked away a double-digit lead against those Chiefs. And a dominant win against the Texans really doesn't mean much, I guess...the Titans were able to bowl them over doing nothing but running the ball on offense behind Derrick Henry. It was honestly a shameful showing given it was incredibly obvious Tennessee would be doing nothing but rushing on offense. And the Titans were still able to win comfortably. When you boil everything down, the Raiders are a trash team with so much potential. It's unlikely much of that potential will actually be realized any time soon. What Vegas desperately needs more than anything is for other weapons to step up in the passing game outside of Davonte Adams.

Another principle I keep learning the hard way - be careful siding with teams that have known inferiority complexes. The Rams once again lost in tragic fashion to their big brother in the 49ers. Unless a team is on the cusp of a major leap forward, be very wary betting on that team.

All right, enough, let's start the analysis for this week.

***

### Rams @ Buccaneers (-3)

***

##### _Streaks_

Rams - 1L  
Bucccaneers - 3L

For the first time in an eon, Brady has lost three games in a row. And none of those games have even been all that competitive.

Likewise, the defending champions are looking at being rendered irrelevant real soon unless they start winning games soon.

##### _Injuries_

The biggest injury concern is Cooper Kupp. Without Kupp, Los Angeles may as well not even bother fielding an offense. All right, maybe I'm exaggerating....but not even that much.

##### _Weather_

A beautiful day with little humidity

##### _History_

It can be argued that the Buccaneers have an inferiority complex here with respect to the Rams. In their past three meetings, Tampa Bay has been simply unable to win one the reigning world champions. In fact, the Rams have not scored less than 27 points in any one of those outings. On the other hand, Brady and company have only seen mixed success against the Rams defense.

***

### Rams +3

***

I learned the hard way the past week - never doubt the inferiority complex. The Buccaneers have such a mentality with regards to Los Angeles, going back two years now.

Now such a complex can be overcome if the team holding those negative feelings is tangible improved from years past. But one can't say that about the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, especially in light of Brady's historic three-game losing streak. Yes, the Rams may suck too, but Tampa's going through a similar decline themselves.

What Sean McVay will likely attempt to do here is matriculate the ball downfield through quick passes, screen plays, and backfield trickery. Not only would that mitigate pressure on their beleaguered offensive line, but it would also expose Tampa's inability to adequately cover the flat.

### Seahawks @ Cardinals (-1.5)

***

##### _Streaks_

Seahawks - 3W  
Cardinals - 1L

Seattle is riding hot on a winning streak.

##### _Injuries_

I think Kyler Murray's finally feeling the rigors of the season - the kid was in a great deal of pain towards the end of that game last week with Minnesota. It's worth noting that we're nearing the midway point of the season too. The past two years, Kyler's level of play has seriously suffered going into November and December, likely as a result of all the blows he sustains in September and October. Don't be surprised if Murray starts performing much worse now that winter is coming.

##### _Weather_

A beautiful day with little humidity

##### _History_

These two met earlier in the year. It was a complete rout by the Seahawks defense, who tallied up several sacks against Arizona. That being said, the Cardinals could have won the game if Kliff Kingsbury only took the field goals instead of going for all those fourth downs.

***

### Uncertain

***

This is a difficult game to call. Arizona's defense effectively shut down Seattle's top-flight offense last time. The Seahawks only won convincingly thanks to Kyler Murray regressing to depressed form and Kliff Kingsbury absolutely refusing multiple field goals.
