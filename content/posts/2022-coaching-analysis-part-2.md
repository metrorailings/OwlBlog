### Indianapolis Colts

_Leadership:_ Frank Reich (HC/OC), Gus Bradley (DC), Matt Ryan (QB)

The Colts are interesting from a leadership perspective. I believe strongly in Frank Reich and his leadership over the offense. Without him, one could argue the Eagles wouldn't have won the championship back in 2017. His understanding of offensive schemes and his attention to detail show up on tape, especially in that road game against Arizona last year when the four of his starting offensive linemen were sidelined with injury. Most other organizations would be incapable of adjusting - not only did Reich adjust, but his men outright won the game.

But I'll tell you this - his ability to evaluate quarterbacks needs to be called into question. First, the man tried to gamble on old man Philip Rivers. When that failed to pan out, the organization gave up valuable draft capital to bring Carson Wentz into the fold. It was believed that under Frank Reich's mentorship, the former first-rounder would blossom again. Instead...the exact opposite happened - the same mistakes and egotistical mindset that plagued him in Philadelphia resurfaced in Indianapolis. But despite that, the team was literally on the cusp of a playoff berth...until Carson went and squandered that away in two embarrassing late-season losses. The Colts quickly became a laughingstock for closing out the season in such disappointing fashion. If there was a silver lining to their campaign last year, it's that Wentz finally realized his true calling - to be a noose choking the life out of any team unfortunate enough to have him on their roster.

This year, the team again dipped into the well of aging quarterbacks by bringing Matt Ryan on board. The hope here is that Ryan can realize his true potential now that he can count on actual football players to protect him inside the pocket, instead of the cadavers Atlanta fielded in front of him. Even better than that, Ryan now finds himself in a very favorable situation considering Indy has one of the league's best offensive lines. If he can shrug off whatever PTSD followed him from Atlanta, he and Reich can make some real hay in terms of offensive production, especially if Jonathan Taylor returns in top form this season.

Gus Bradley remains another interesting question as well. It's easy to dismiss the man after his disastrous years over in Jacksonville and his stubborn insistence on running a defensive scheme long after it's been decoded. But the Raiders defensive unit he coached last year performed surprisingly well, especially in the tail end of the season when Vegas was fighting for a wild-card invite. Bradley also found ways to leverage Yannick Ngakoue's skill set, something Minnesota nor Baltimore could quite figure out.

Still...it does worry me that the Raiders defense surrendered over 40 points against the Chiefs both times they met last year. It's not good when a division rival dominates you so thoroughly in two meetings, especially when those meetings are only a few weeks apart from one another. Rewatching the first half of their Sunday night match-up in 2021, the Raiders were selling out to play the deep ball, leaving easy completions to Travis Kelce underneath. Actually, these completions shouldn't have come as easy as they did, but it seems the Raiders linebackers and safeties were helpless against Kelce. Even a starting cornerback couldn't do much against Kelce in press coverage. Vegas adjusted in the second half by playing more cover-three, but Mahomes and Tyreek Hill adjusted quickly as well, connecting on some deep passes against the thinly-manned defensive backfield. It's possible that the Chiefs were simply more amped to play the game compared to the Raiders, especially as Jon Gruden wasn't there to stoke that hatred against Kansas that used to fuel Vegas. But it's still disappointing that an organization that played these Chiefs so ferociously the year before completely collapsed, and defensive ineptitude played a large role in why this collapse happened.

In the end, I'm not sure what to make of this Indy team. It needs a few big uncertainties to fall in their favor, and as I've learned the hard way in making these preseason forecasts, teams that have multiple questions to answer don't usually end up answering all of them in positive fashion.

### New Orleans Saints

_Leaders:_ Dennis Allen (HC/DC), Pete Carmichael (OC), Jameis Winston / Andy Dalton / Taysom Hill (QB)

It's hard to assess these Saints. First off, Dennis Allen's previous head coaching experience was disastrous, to say the least. Though it's argued he wasn't given much help in terms of roster talent, the Raiders only logged 8 wins under him while losing 22 contests.

As a defensive coordinator though, the man's worked magic, marshaling quite a bit of production from a roster that's above average at best. His defense consistently kept teams in negative EPA territory last season. A few of the sadder performances they put forth last year came when they suffered as a result of the mistakes the offense kept making. Despite the offense literally flailing through much of the season because of all the instability at the quarterback position, the defense was so good that the Saints finished the year with a winning record.

But as head coach, it remains to be seen whether the man can install the type of culture and discipline Sean Payton was able to cultivate in the organization. Coordinators have quite a few responsibilities, but head coaches are uniquely charged with a certain responsibility that can't be learned by anybody not in that role - head coaches need to provide that glue capable of holding a club together through the rigors of the season. And that glue isn't easy to make. If anything, it's more an art than a science, as there's no one formula out there to help coaches develop that glue. A mix of judiciousness, authority, respect, composure, and organization skills are needed to install that culture binding a team together. Whether Dennis Allen finished learning all those skills during his tenure under Sean Payton remains to be seen.

On top of that, Payton's absence also means Pete Carmichael is now formally assuming offensive coordinator duties. Carmichael will now be shepherding this unit on game day instead of Payton. Is he ready? I have no idea, to be frank. He's spent 16 years working jointly with Payton. Now he'll have to assume the role without any guidance from his former head coach.

The Saints will be interesting to watch. Not much is expected from them, but they'll still be exciting to watch only to see whether Allen and Carmichael can rise to the next level now that they'll be heading into battle without their trusted general.
