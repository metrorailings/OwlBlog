### Indianapolis Colts

_Leadership:_ Frank Reich (HC/OC), Gus Bradley (DC), Matt Ryan (QB)

The Colts are interesting from a leadership perspective. I believe strongly in Frank Reich and his leadership over the offense. Without him, one could argue the Eagles wouldn't have won the championship back in 2017. His understanding of offensive schemes and his attention to detail show up on tape, especially in that road game against Arizona last year when the four of his starting offensive linemen were sidelined with injury. Most other organizations would be incapable of adjusting - not only did Reich adjust, but his men outright won the game. 

But I'll tell you this - his ability to evaluate quarterbacks needs to be called into question. First, the man tried to gamble on old man Philip Rivers. When that failed to pan out, the organization gave up valuable draft capital to bring Carson Wentz into the fold. It was believed that under Frank Reich's mentorship, the former first-rounder would blossom again. Instead...the exact opposite happened - the same mistakes and egotistical mindset that plagued him in Philadelphia resurfaced in Indianapolis. But despite that, the team was literally on the cusp of a playoff berth...until Carson went and squandered that away in two embarrassing late-season losses. The Colts quickly became a laughingstock for closing out the season in such disappointing fashion. If there was a silver lining to their campaign last year, it's that Wentz finally realized his true calling - to be a noose choking the life out of any team unfortunate enough to have him on their roster.

This year, the team again dipped into the well of aging quarterbacks by bringing Matt Ryan on board. The hope here is that Ryan can realize his true potential now that he can count on actual football players to protect him inside the pocket, instead of the cadavers Atlanta fielded in front of him. Even better than that, Ryan now finds himself in a very favorable situation considering Indy has one of the league's best offensive lines. If he can shrug off whatever PTSD followed him from Atlanta, he and Reich can make some real hay in terms of offensive production, especially if Jonathan Taylor returns in top form this season.

Gus Bradley remains another interesting question as well. It's easy to dismiss the man after his disastrous years over in Jacksonville and his stubborn insistence on running a defensive scheme long after it's been decoded. But the Raiders defensive unit he coached last year performed surprisingly well, especially in the tail end of the season when Vegas was fighting for a wild-card invite. Bradley also found ways to leverage Yannick Ngakoue's skill set, something Minnesota nor Baltimore could quite figure out.

Still...it does worry me that the Raiders defense surrendered over 40 points against the Chiefs both times they met last year.
