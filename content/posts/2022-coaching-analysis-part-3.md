### Green Bay Packers

_Leadership:_ Matt LaFleur (HC/OC), Joe Barry (DC), Aaron Rodgers (QB)

These Packers concern me. I've been trashing them the past couple years and the club's done nothing but prove me wrong. This year though...this year may be that year the team finally falls hard from grace. They've traded away their best weapon on offense, a move all the more foolish given he was responsible for roughly 40% of their production in the passing offense last year. On top of that, free agency stole away yet another favorite target of Aaron Rodgers - Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Arguably, the only proven weapons left on that team are Allen Lazard and Robert Tonyan. Maybe Randall Cobb and Sammy Watkins can develop into reliable outlets in the passing game, but it's certain nobody on that roster can carry the air game quite like Davante Adams. In fact, no one player stands out in that receiving corps, so any success Green Bay enjoys in the air will need to come from Aaron Rodgers working his magic and LaFleur devising new concepts to throw off opponents.

But who the hell are we kidding? Nobody respectable actually believes in Matt LaFleur. LaFleur might be a decent head coach, but his game planning and strategizing is just pathetic. Nowhere was this more evident than Green Bay's postseason losses. The Packers offense has consistently squandered away so many opportunities to advance far into the playoffs and contend meaningfully for a championship, something that's all the more disappointing considering Aaron Rodgers has been playing at an MVP level the past two seasons. Against Tampa Bay and San Francisco's capable defenses, too many drives stalled quickly. I'm assuming a lack of creativity makes this offense way too predictable. Normally, a lack of imagination isn't necessarily a bad thing so long as the unit is brimming with talent, but that's not the case with Green Bay's offense. Any adjustments are negligible at best.

Furthermore, the defense doesn't inspire me much at all. Joe Barry started out strong, but two games late in the season led me to question his aptitude. Against Baltimore, his refusal to corral Lamar Jackson in the pocket was almost criminal - the Ravens came so close to mounting a successful comeback precisely because Lamar was allowed to run free. The week after against the Browns, his defense gave up way too much ground to Cleveland's running game -  Cleveland's tailbacks were chewing off 8 yards on average with each run. Had the Browns actually had a competent quarterback helming their offense, they'd have won the game easily.

If it isn't clear enough already, I have very few expectations for this team. Somehow, this club manages to string together far more wins than people expect, but it matters little come January. Against teams with solid rosters and quality coaching, Green Bay falls apart. This season though, a postseason berth isn't a slam dunk now that their roster no longer features players who were so critical to their success the past couple of years. A playoff invite is still a very real possibility, but let's not be shocked should the Packers finally collapse under the weight of their hubris.
