### Carolina Panthers

_Leadership:_ Matt Rhule (HC), Ben McAdoo (OC), Phil Snow (DC), Sam Darnold / Baker Mayfield (QB)

The Matt Rhule era in Carolina could finally end this season. Unless key actors on this team surprise me, the Panthers have done little to change the trajectory of their organization after last year's tragic campaign.

Let's start with the offense. The club made a good move canning Joe Brady, but Ben McAdoo isn't necessarily the right replacement. McAdoo chiefly runs a safer variant of the air raid - his offense emphasizes looser formations with 3-4 receivers flared out along the wings. It's a style of offense tailored more towards bull-headed quarterbacks who aren't afraid to sling the ball around or shoulder the burden of production. Sam Darnold certainly isn't that quarterback. Baker Mayfield may have some of that temperament McAdoo wants in his ideal quarterback, but Baker's shown time and time again that he's incapable of leading through skill or intelligence. Sure, he's shown admirable toughness, but that isn't nearly enough to thrive in an offense that demands so much from the quarterback.
