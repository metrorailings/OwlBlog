### Carolina Panthers

_Leadership:_ Matt Rhule (HC), Ben McAdoo (OC), Phil Snow (DC), Sam Darnold / Baker Mayfield (QB)

The Matt Rhule era in Carolina could finally end this season. Unless key actors on this team surprise me, the Panthers have done little to change the trajectory of their organization after last year's tragic campaign.

Let's start with the offense. The club made a good move canning Joe Brady, but Ben McAdoo isn't necessarily the right replacement. McAdoo chiefly runs a safer variant of the air raid - his offense emphasizes looser formations with 3-4 receivers flared out along the wings. It's a style of offense tailored more towards bull-headed quarterbacks who aren't afraid to sling the ball around or shoulder the burden of production successfully. Sam Darnold certainly isn't that quarterback. Baker Mayfield may have some of that temperament McAdoo wants in his ideal quarterback, but Baker's shown time and time again that he's incapable of leading through skill or intelligence. Sure, he's shown admirable toughness, but that isn't nearly enough to thrive in an offense that demands so much from the quarterback.    Christian McCaffrey is probably the best weapon on offense, but his durability worries me - the man's only played 10 games over the past two seasons.

Things aren't much better on defense either. The team letting Haason Reddick walk was foolish considering he was pretty productive as a pass rusher lining up alongside Brian Burns in the trenches. Rhule and Snow are likely expecting Derrick Brown or Yetur Gross-Matos to account for the missed production, but neither are guaranteed to do so. On top of that, Phil Snow is such an uninspiring coordinator - it sickens me to see the man pick the worst times to call three-man pass rushes. Three-man pass rushes only work when used judiciously in choice circumstances, but Snow's never really demonstrated much nuance in the way he manages his defense. It shows in the EPA chart below.

Not only did Carolina's defense worsen as the season waned onward, but the unit didn't fare so well against division rivals in subsequent matches, which tells me offensive coordinators gained a beat on their tendencies.

The fact that the sportsbooks seem to forecast this team winning only 6 games this season is damning enough. One would have thought the inclusion of Baker Mayfield would have boosted this team's prospects, but the experts feel otherwise. I'm inclined to agree.

### Kansas City Chiefs

_Leadership:_ Andy Reid (HC/OC), Steve Spagnuolo (DC), Patrick Mahomes (QB)

The Chiefs are always a fun team to analyze, being perennial championship contenders. This year should be no different. Even though Tyreek Hill and a few other receivers are no longer with the club, don't expect the offense to lose much a step here - Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Juju Smith-Schuster were signed in the offseason, so the unit won't be lacking in weapons. Yes, neither player can adequately replace Tyreek Hill, but the whole point is to shift the identity of the offense. No longer will the Chiefs be defined by
