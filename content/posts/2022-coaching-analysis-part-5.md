### Jacksonville Jaguars

_Leadership:_ Doug Pederson (HC), Press Taylor (OC), Mike Caldwell (DC), Trevor Lawrence (QB)

Yet another new completely regime to analyze.

First off, let's start with the one known quantity, Doug Pederson. Pederson is an experienced coach who's proven that with the right assistants, he can build a championship team. Sure, his zeal for analytics may be a bit maddening at times, but his mostly successful tenure with the Philadelphia Eagles should be reassuring to anybody harboring doubts here. On a side note, one wonders whether he was unfairly burned at the stake in Philadelphia considering Carson Wentz is an albatross around the neck of any team unfortunate enough to feature him on the roster.
