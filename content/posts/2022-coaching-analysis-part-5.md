### Jacksonville Jaguars

_Leadership:_ Doug Pederson (HC), Press Taylor (OC), Mike Caldwell (DC), Trevor Lawrence (QB)

Yet another new completely regime to analyze.

First off, let's start with the one known quantity, Doug Pederson. Pederson is an experienced coach who's proven that he can build a championship team so long as he has the right assistants at his side. Sure, his zeal for analytics may be a bit maddening at times, but his mostly successful tenure with the Philadelphia Eagles should be reassuring to anybody harboring doubts here. On a side note, one wonders whether he was unfairly burned at the stake in Philadelphia considering Carson Wentz is an albatross around the neck of any team unfortunate enough to feature him on the roster.

Anyway, let's move on to Press Taylor. A bit of an unknown quantity, Taylor spent much of his coaching career in the NFL working under Pederson and Frank Reich in Indianapolis. The architect of the Philly Special play, it's clear the man draws up some imaginative plays, but as far as I can remember, none of that imagination was really on display during his brief stint with the Colts organization. In fact, the Indianapolis offense last season was mainly defined by a power rushing attack headlined by Jonathan Taylor.

The situation becomes murkier when we look at the defensive side of the equation here. Little is known about new coordinator Mike Caldwell besides his recent experience working under the direction of Todd Bowles as the inside linebackers coach for Tampa Bay. It's a mystery as to how he'll structure the defense, although odds are he'll attempt to emulate Bowles' approach to defense. If that's the case, expect a good number of blitz packages to be woven into his call sheet. But...is the Jaguars roster built to blitz? Good question. We'll find out come November or December when the defense is fully steeped in whatever system Caldwell installs. My intuition tells me that the Jaguars do have the horses to be successful practicing a blitz-happy style of football, so long as those blitzes are schemed to favor their best pass rushers - Dawuane Smoot, Josh Allen, and (presumably) Travon Walker.

Can we forecast anything here? Well, Trevor Lawrence should evolve his game to the next level now that a proper head coach is mentoring him and running the team in a structured manner. After all, if he can show moments of promise last year despite operating in an environment wrought with chaos, then things should be much better this year, especially now that Jacksonville has spent significant money bringing in some weapons for him. It's worth noting that the offense is still missing a premiere receiver.

On top of that, Jacksonville may actually win enough games to no longer qualify for the top draft pick this season. Though playoffs are likely a pipe dream, a 6-7 win season is not unreal, especially if the roster adjusts quickly to the new coaching regime.

### Cleveland Browns

_Leadership_: Kevin Stefansky (HC/OC), Joe Woods (DC), Deshaun Watson (QB)

***

### New England Patriots

_Leadership:_ Bill Belichick (HC/DC), Matt Patricia (OC), Steve Belichick (DC), Mac Jones (QB)

I honestly have no idea what Bill Belichick is thinking, handing offensive play-calling duties over to _Matt Patricia_, of all people. Yes, Patricia started  life in the NFL as an offensive assistant, but the fool's spent the rest of his career specializing in defense. Role transitions are fraught with risk when you cross the line of scrimmage after spending so much time on one side. On top of that, nothing in Patricia's history suggests he's ready to coach offense, let alone coach in general. His tenure in Detroit was an absolute disaster, best exemplified when players popped off champagne bottles in the locker room to celebrate news of his firing. His defenses have usually been flops, both in New England and in Detroit. In fact, the Patriot units he led as coordinator have been noted as unusually soft. So if he's unable to field a capable defense despite spending years honing his understanding of that part of the game, how can one expect him to pick up offense in only a few months **and** tutor a young quarterback entering his sophomore year? It's just not possible.

On defense, things aren't much better. I think the senior Belichick has lost a step. Unfortunately, junior isn't quite ready to step in his father's shoes just yet, if last year was any indication. I know the Belichicks are keen on blaming the older players to explain away why the defense blew chunks towards the end of the season last year, but that argument doesn't sit well with me. It doesn't excuse away how the Bills roasted New England in the postseason, drumming up 7 touchdowns against the Patriot defense. It was the worst beatdown of the postseason, something one wouldn't expect from a Belichick team.

This season, the franchise rid itself of some of the oldest mainstays from the defense. Now that younger faces are guaranteed to feature more prominently in games, the Belichicks don't have to worry about the the defensive unit lacking physicality or athleticism. That being said, the defensive front still lacks punch outside of Matthew Judon. Christian Barmore holds some promise, but nobody else really inspires much confidence. Chase Winovich is no longer there. Deatrich Wise is average at best. Josh Uche's too hobbled by injury. Who else is there to carry the pass rush?

It's tough to expect this team to improve much from last year, despite all the hype surrounding Mac Jones as he enters his second year in the professional leagues. Too many questions are plaguing, the biggest being whether Matt Patricia can actually command this offense competently.

### San Francisco 49ers

_Leadership:_ Kyle Shanahan (HC/OC), DeMeco Ryans (DC), Trey Lance (QB)

The 49ers are a tricky team to forecast for one reason and one reason alone - Trey Lance. The kid has quite a few issues, judging by the few games worth of tape on him from last year. His athleticism and scrambling ability is there, but so many other things things are missing - pocket presence, accuracy, touch on throws, forethought, etc. Essentially, the soon-to-be sophomore passer doesn't have the mental tools needed to succeed as a quarterback in the professional realm. Perhaps Kyle Shanahan can work some magic over the boy now that he's spent one full year working with Lance and familiarizing him with some of the finer intricacies of the playbook...but the skeptic in me says otherwise.

Yes, people can point to Josh Allen as somebody else who took several years to blossom into an elite passer despite lacking so many quarterbacking fundamentals entering the league...but Allen is a precious exception. I can't think of any other time in recent history that a quarterback demonstrated such a remarkable turnaround in terms of accuracy and intellectual prowess. Lance could be another Cinderella story, but it'll take a few full years worth of experience before any metamorphosis happens. So expect little from Lance.

That being said, San Francisco can still win the majority of their games this season based on the strength of the rest of their roster. Deebo Samuel is an absolute force to be reckoned with. His talent combined with a capable ground game and a healthy George Kittle, the team can remain productive on offense even if Lance proves to be a burden. Defensively, the Niners should be fine given most of the key elements of that unit are returning from last year. Sure, the team will now be fielding a bunch of new cornerbacks, but I trust DeMeco Ryans to train them accordingly. His competence as defensive coordinator can't be questioned any more after the masterful game plan he put together against the Packers in the playoffs. Never have I witnessed Aaron Rodgers completely suffocated - the MVP only managed to post up a little over 170 yards after the first drive of the game. Truly remarkable.

So ultimately, San Francisco remains one of the better teams in the league, even if expectations for them are muted largely because of Trey Lance. If Lance struggles as expected, the 49ers will win several games, but will probably miss the postseason. If Lance exceeds despite my skepticism...I may be seeing the 49ers try and stake themselves as a dark horse contender for the championship yet again this year. Too bad Kyle Shanahan has a tendency to blow leads though...
