### Jacksonville Jaguars

_Leadership:_ Doug Pederson (HC), Press Taylor (OC), Mike Caldwell (DC), Trevor Lawrence (QB)

Yet another new completely regime to analyze.

First off, let's start with the one known quantity, Doug Pederson. Pederson is an experienced coach who's proven that with the right assistants, he can build a championship team. Sure, his zeal for analytics may be a bit maddening at times, but his mostly successful tenure with the Philadelphia Eagles should be reassuring to anybody harboring doubts here. On a side note, one wonders whether he was unfairly burned at the stake in Philadelphia considering Carson Wentz is an albatross around the neck of any team unfortunate enough to feature him on the roster.

Anyway, let's move on to Press Taylor. A bit of an unknown quantity, Taylor spent much of his coaching career in the NFL working under Pederson and Frank Reich in Indianapolis. The architect of the Philly Special play, it's clear the man draws up some imaginative plays, but as far as I can remember, none of that imagination was really on display during his brief time with the Colts organization. In fact, the Indianapolis offense was mainly defined by a power rushing attack headlined by Jonathan Taylor.

The situation becomes murkier as look at the defensive side of the equation here. Little is known about Mike Caldwell, besides his recent experience working under the direction of Todd Bowles as the inside linebackers coach for Tampa Bay. It's a mystery as to how he'll structure the defense, although odds are he'll attempt to emulate Bowles' approach to defense. If that's the case, then expect a good number of blitz packages to be woven into his playbook. Is the Jaguars roster built to blitz? Good question. We'll find out come November or December when the defense fully embraces whatever philosophy Caldwell is trying to institute in them.
