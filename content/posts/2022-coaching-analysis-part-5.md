### Jacksonville Jaguars

_Leadership:_ Doug Pederson (HC), Press Taylor (OC), Mike Caldwell (DC), Trevor Lawrence (QB)

Yet another new completely regime to analyze.

First off, let's start with the one known quantity, Doug Pederson. Pederson is an experienced coach who's proven that he can build a championship team so long as he has the right assistants at his side. Sure, his zeal for analytics may be a bit maddening at times, but his mostly successful tenure with the Philadelphia Eagles should be reassuring to anybody harboring doubts here. On a side note, one wonders whether he was unfairly burned at the stake in Philadelphia considering Carson Wentz is an albatross around the neck of any team unfortunate enough to feature him on the roster.

Anyway, let's move on to Press Taylor. A bit of an unknown quantity, Taylor spent much of his coaching career in the NFL working under Pederson and Frank Reich in Indianapolis. The architect of the Philly Special play, it's clear the man draws up some imaginative plays, but as far as I can remember, none of that imagination was really on display during his brief stint with the Colts organization. In fact, the Indianapolis offense last season was mainly defined by a power rushing attack headlined by Jonathan Taylor.

The situation becomes murkier when we look at the defensive side of the equation here. Little is known about new coordinator Mike Caldwell besides his recent experience working under the direction of Todd Bowles as the inside linebackers coach for Tampa Bay. It's a mystery as to how he'll structure the defense, although odds are he'll attempt to emulate Bowles' approach to defense. If that's the case, expect a good number of blitz packages to be woven into his call sheet. But...is the Jaguars roster built to blitz? Good question. We'll find out come November or December when the defense is fully steeped in whatever system Caldwell installs. My intuition tells me that the Jaguars do have the horses to be successful practicing a blitz-happy style of football, so long as those blitzes are schemed to favor their best pass rushers - Dawuane Smoot, Josh Allen, and (presumably) Travon Walker.

Can we forecast anything here? Well, Trevor Lawrence should evolve his game to the next level now that a proper head coach is mentoring him and running the team in a structured manner. After all, if he can show moments of promise last year despite operating in an environment wrought with chaos, then things should be much better this year, especially now that Jacksonville has spent significant money bringing in some weapons for him. It's worth noting that the offense is still missing a premiere receiver.

On top of that, Jacksonville may actually win enough games to no longer qualify for the top draft pick this season. Though playoffs are likely a pipe dream, a 6-7 win season is not unreal, especially if the roster adjusts quickly to the new coaching regime.
