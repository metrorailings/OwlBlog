### Tampa Bay Buccaneers

_Leadership:_ Todd Bowles (HC/DC), Byron Leftwich/Tom Brady (OC), Tom Brady (QB)

Even without Bruce Arians, don't expect much to change. Bowles taking over the head coaching vacancy virtually guarantees not much with change defensively or offensively. And that's a good thing.

Defensively, the club is humming so long as the injury bug doesn't run rabid through the unit again. Last year proved that Bowles needs time to indoctrinate his men in his philosophy of defense, so losing players not only drags this team downward performantly, but it effects their strategizing as well - some of their more complex schemes can't be invoked so long as replacement-level players are manning key positions on defense. That being said, if first-round prospect Joe Tryon-Shiyonka finally emerges as a viable threat in the trenches opposite Shaquil Barrett and Vita Vea can stay healthy again this year, expect the Buccaneers to be truly phenomenal this year at rushing the passer. And having that luxury could mask quite a few deficiencies elsewhere along that defense.

Offensively...after Brady's retirement, the organization was ready to promote _Blaine Gabbert_ to replace him. But before Buccaneer fans had enough time to sell their Brady shirts and figure out a new team to support, Tommy boy came back, salvaging the team's championship hopes. Apparently, time with the family was a circle of hell that not even Brady can stand. Either that or Brady simply cannot exist in a state where he's not playing football. Anyway, now that Brady is back and Byron Leftwich has still been retained as the team's coordinator, don't expect anything to change, tactically speaking. Brady's preferred style of offense favors throws towards receivers running routes between the numbers, peppered with deep throws along the sidelines to his big-play threats. It's a system of offense that's clearly worked for the franchise in the past two years. This year though...expect some hiccups. Three of his four favorite receivers will no longer be there to start the season. People like Russell Gage and Cameron Brate need to elevate their game if the team's to remain just as fruitful this year as in years past. I forecast growing pains however, similar to what we saw in 2020 before the unit finally settled into championship form.

So with all that said, does this team stand as a favorite to win the Super Bowl? Not too sure. A postseason invite is all but certain given their weak division. The real question is whether the club has enough horses to see them through multiple playoff contests. Without Jason Pierre-Paul, Rob Gronkowski, Antonio Brown, and Chris Godwin (for most of the season), the club's missing too many prime players to be considered serious contenders for the Lombardi trophy. Either those vacancies are quickly filled by new blood or the team suffers through another playoff loss next January.
