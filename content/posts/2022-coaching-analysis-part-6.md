### Tampa Bay Buccaneers

_Leadership:_ Todd Bowles (HC/DC), Byron Leftwich/Tom Brady (OC), Tom Brady (QB)

Even without Bruce Arians, don't expect much to change. Bowles taking over the head coaching vacancy virtually guarantees not much with change defensively or offensively. And that's a good thing.

Defensively, the club is humming so long as the injury bug doesn't run rabid through the unit again. Last year proved that Bowles needs time to indoctrinate his men in his philosophy of defense, so losing players not only drags this team downward performantly, but it effects their strategizing as well - some of their more complex schemes can't be invoked so long as replacement-level players are manning key positions on defense. That being said, if first-round prospect Joe Tryon-Shiyonka finally emerges as a viable threat in the trenches opposite Shaquil Barrett and Vita Vea can stay healthy again this year, expect the Buccaneers to be truly phenomenal this year at rushing the passer. And having that luxury could mask quite a few deficiencies elsewhere along that defense.

Offensively...after Brady's retirement, the organization was ready to promote _Blaine Gabbert_ to replace him. But before Buccaneer fans had enough time to sell their Brady shirts and figure out a new team to support, Tommy boy came back, salvaging the team's championship hopes. Apparently, time with the family was a circle of hell that not even Brady can stand. Either that or Brady simply cannot exist in a state where he's not playing football. Anyway, now that Brady is back and Byron Leftwich has still been retained as the team's coordinator, don't expect anything to change, tactically speaking. Brady's preferred style of offense favors throws towards receivers running routes between the numbers, peppered with deep throws along the sidelines to his big-play threats. It's a system of offense that's clearly worked for the franchise in the past two years. This year though...expect some hiccups. Three of his four favorite receivers will no longer be there to start the season. People like Russell Gage and Cameron Brate need to elevate their game if the team's to remain just as fruitful this year as in years past. I forecast growing pains however, similar to what we saw in 2020 before the unit finally settled into championship form.

So with all that said, does this team stand as a favorite to win the Super Bowl? Not too sure. A postseason invite is all but certain given their weak division. The real question is whether the club has enough horses to see them through multiple playoff contests. Without Jason Pierre-Paul, Rob Gronkowski, Antonio Brown, and Chris Godwin (for most of the season), the club's missing too many players at prime positions to be considered serious contenders for the Lombardi trophy. Either those vacancies are quickly filled by new blood or the team suffers through another playoff loss next January.

### Arizona Cardinals

_Leadership:_ Kliff Kingsbury (HC/OC), Vance Joseph (DC), Kyler Murray (QB)

After inking Kyler Murray to a huge contract, all Arizona needs right now is....a quarterback? Wait....what?

Truthfully, Kyler Murray is not the long-term answer to Arizona's quarterbacking problem, a problem that's been plaguing them since the Kurt Warner era over a decade ago. It's not that the man lacks talent or arm strength - it's the lack of drive and maturity. The past two years has sold me on this idea that Murray is not built for the marathon of a full season. The kid shines flashes of greatness the first several weeks of the season only to completely collapse in November and December once the hits mount and the weekly routine starts boring him. It takes dedication and discipline for a quarterback to endure the grind of a full season, something we've seen before from great quarterbacks like Brady and Peyton Manning. Judging by the contract language specifically stipulating that Kyler dedicate at least four hours a week to studying his upcoming opponent...it's virtually guaranteed Murray lacks that same passion. That apathy becomes all the more obvious when one examines his sideline demeanor throughout the season - the kid's missing the enthusiasm for the game, let alone his fellow teammates. It's a quality that cannot be honed in him at this point in his life either, so Arizona's decision to extend him with a blockbuster contract really baffles me. I can only speculate that Kingsbury and Steve Keim doubled down on him to salvage their investment. Keep in mind that Kyler didn't come cheap - it took the top overall pick as well as an embarrassingly early abortion of the Josh Rosen project.

It's a shame too that the Cardinals have handcuffed themselves at the quarterback position - Kliff has really proven himself to be one of the better coordinators in the league. His willingness to adapt his air raid approach to offensive football into something more suitable for the professional leagues impressed me alone, but add on top the work he's done to help Colt McCoy win two out of the three games he started last year and I'd be hard pressed to argue that Kliff is anything less than a red-chip coach.

Defensively, we may have a bit of an issue. Vance Joseph runs a complicated scheme in part because of the myriad number of ways he loves to throw blitzes at opposing quarterbacks. Arizona has the horses in rein to run such a complex system, but the results have been mixed - just look at the chart below.

Despite all their talent, the team actually ended up surrendering more meaningful yardage towards the end of the season. The last four games particularly were disappointing from a defensive standpoint. Why is that? I'm still not too sure. Maybe too many injuries finally revealed some ugly depth? Maybe Kyler's lack of enthusiasm sapped this team's morale?  Maybe the book was out on all the little tricks Vance Joseph loves to employ? Either way, the defense always gave me the strange vibe that somehow...the unit was less than the sum of its parts. And if that vibe is true, then that unfortunately signifies poor coaching.

That being said, don't get me wrong - the defense is stacked with talent, especially in the backfield. Up front, Chandler Jones departing in free agency leaves behind a vacuum. Without him, the team lacks a definitive pass rushing threat, though the hope is that Markus Golden rotates into that role and J.J. Watt is finally able to avoid injury the whole season and play that complimentary role he was meant to play. We'll see whether that actually happens. It's also possible Zach Allen also establishes himself as a top-tier pass rusher, but until this happens, I'm just speculating here.

So where do we stand here? I'm not too sure. It seems this Cardinal club has too many potential points of vulnerability keeping them from contending for the championship. That being said, if they're lucky, a path to the Super Bowl is there. Kyler will need to get sidelined early in the season so that he can save his best performances later when they actually matter. Somebody else besides Markus Golden will need to step up as an elite pass rushing threat. And Hollywood Brown just has to find some rhythm in this new offense now that Christian Kirk is away. If all these things happen...Arizona could be a sleeper pick for the Lombardi.

### Atlanta Falcons

_Leadership_: Arthur Smith (HC/OC), Dean Pees (DC), Marcus Mariota / Desmond Ritter (QB)

The team's waving that white flag this season, albeit for good reason. Moving on from Matt Ryan was always going to be an expensive proposition, but it had to be done to reset their salary cap for a proper rebuild. Now that Matt Ryan is gone, Atlanta will need to spend a year in purgatory before they're allowed to spend funds freely again to acquire talent. Until then, this season is largely defined by experimenting with prospects.

The two main prospects to test are at the quarterback position. Arthur Smith will need to determine whether Mariota can serve as the face of this team in the short-term while he goes out exploring for a franchise quarterback. That being said, I doubt Mariota will even survive the rest of this year given the sorry state of the offensive line. Atlanta's offensive line was among the worst in the league and the organization has done precious little to remedy that issue. Even given a prime opportunity to select a potentially elite offensive lineman in the draft, the Falcons happily went with Drake London instead, marking two years in a row that Atlanta has opted to spend their top pick on a skill position. It's a little worrying too, as it almost certifies that Arthur Smith prizes weaponry over protection. And that's going to end up getting Mariota killed sooner rather than later. Once Marcus is sidelined, Desmond Ritter will be thrust into action. Now Ritter was one of the top quarterbacking candidates in the latest draft, though it's worth noting there really wasn't too much solid talent coming out of college this year at the passer position. Whether Ritter can flash under Arthur Smith's tutelage and behind this tattered shell of an offensive line remains to be seen.

To Smith's credit, he's impressed in Tennessee mentoring Ryan Tannehill. And he revived Cordarelle Patterson's career last year, a feat that certified geniuses like Josh McDaniels and Matt Nagy couldn't even pull off.  And let's not forget the fact that the club managed to pull off seven wins last year with such a barebones roster. Perhaps some of that was attributable to Matt Ryan and his innate toughness, but it's still an impressive result from a first-time head coach.
