### Tennessee Titans

_Leadership_: Mike Vrabel (HC/DC), Todd Downing (OC), Ryan Tannehill (QB)

I had these Titans down as the Super Bowl favorites in my annual postseason analysis last year. Tennessee had just enough requisite elements in their favor to make a deep playoff run. But I didn't count on Ryan Tannehill and Todd Downing failing the franchise on offense in spectacular fashion.

Two data points from their division round loss against the Bengals stand out - Tannehill throwing three interceptions and D'Onta Foreman rushing for 4 more yards than Derrick Henry despite recording _16 fewer carries_. The former has confirmed a sentiment that's been nagging at me now the past two years - Ryan Tannehill is rocketing way past his prime. His mistakes are all the more unforgivable now that he's unable to carry the burden of production on offense. So unfortunately, that burden must now be fully borne on the shoulders of the playmakers around him. Thankfully, Tennessee understood that, so they wasted no time in trading away A.J. Brown and allowing Anthony Firkser and Julio Jones to walk for pennies....wait....what? What's this franchise thinking, kneecapping their own offense coming off an astoundingly successful season in which they were considered legitimate Super Bowl contenders? To be fair, the team signed Robert Woods and Austin Hooper as replacements, but it's underwhelming to see this club opt not to devote more resources to a needy offense when the championship is just in reach.

I suppose the thinking here is that the offense was conceptually sound, but just rendered unproductive by the injury bug. That's problematic though, because their loss against the Bengals in the playoffs showed me their offensive game-planning isn't there, something that isn't immediately evident when you look at their EPA chart.

But look at the raw passing numbers and you'll notice the team was languishing in the passing game. To their credit, injuries robbed them of their two biggest weapons. Luckily, a rookie receiver was able to step up to provide some production, but it was still a pointed area of concern towards the tail end of the season. As far as I could tell, it seems Tennessee's brain trust did little to find a solution.

But you want to know what I truly find damn near inexcusable? Coordinator Todd Downing called upon Derrick Henry to assume the role of primary ball carrier, even when it was laughably obvious the man wasn't physically ready yet to merit a starring role on the offense. His understudy in D'Onta Foreman managed to generate as much production as him with a quarter of the carries. Downing should have realized that in the postseason and called on Foreman to assume the mantle of production on the ground. Instead, a declining Tannehill was forced to move the ball down the field all by himself, resulting in some of the worst quarterback play I've seen so far in January.

Yet, the club was so close to winning that game against Cincinnati, thanks entirely to Mike Vrabel and the defense. The defensive front was sensational attacking Cincinnati's tattered offensive line and racking up 13 hits on Joe Burrow. The secondary performed adequately enough, keeping. Bengals receivers away from the end zone. But even before that game, Vrabel needs to be laude for the way he kept this defense humming through the regular season despite injuries ravaging the unit. EPA analysis actually suggests the unit managed to improve as the season progressed.

If there's any fault to be found here, it's that Vrabel paid Harold Landry in the offseason, despite the man's ghost act in the second half of the season - it's a rather trivial complaint compared to everything Vrabel's done to whip these Titan defenders into shape. It's virtually certain the unit will once again be among the cream of the crop in the upcoming season.

So where does Tennessee stand? Well, it's hard to categorize them confidently as championship contenders. Even if they're sound defensively, the offense remains troubling, if only because the organization has done criminally little to improve things. In fact, it's quite possible the Titans have embraced a rebuild on that side of the ball. So unless Derrick Henry returns back to elite form and wards off the injury bug for the whole season (a stretch given his age and the wear and tear on his body), it's hard to see this unit being anything more than an albatross on this team. Unless the defense performs at a historically great level, the Titans can expect nothing more than another postseason invite ending in another depressing loss.

### Baltimore Ravens

_Leadership:_ Jon Harbaugh (HC), Greg Roman (OC), Mike Macdonald (DC), Lamar Jackson (QB)

Let's talk of another team that was stricken by an injury plague last year. Football Outsiders have these Ravens ranked as the \[franchise worst effected by injury last season\]([https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2022/agl-injury-numbers-point-ravens-rebound-2022](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2022/agl-injury-numbers-point-ravens-rebound-2022) "https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2022/agl-injury-numbers-point-ravens-rebound-2022")), which alone says it all. This year, the statistical law of regression to the average should help them return to normal in terms of injury health. That alone should garner better results, presumably. But...some issues present themselves on both sides of the ball.

On offense, the Lamar Jackson show is showing its age. It's been three years since Greg Roman has changed the face of this offense to revolve more about Lamar's legs. But Jackson's yards per game has gone down significantly since his MVP year. His passing hasn't visibly improved much, though the top receivers on the team have been notably more productive. That being said, losing Hollywood Brown may hurt, as Mark Andrews is now the only worthwhile receiver on the team is Mark Andrews at this point. Unless Devin Duvernay or another depth emerges as a reliable second option, the passing game loses some of its teeth. Perhaps Jackson's legs would be given new life if Roman incorporates new concepts into his playbook, but history tells us it's unlikely Roman changes much schematically. In fact, it's worth noting that the system that he incorporated in San Francisco with Colin Kaepernick as his quarterback is the same one in place in Baltimore, just jazzed up though with some more exotic rushing formations. So expect more of the same from the Ravens offense as they're forced to rely on its ground game to sustain production.

On defense, Wink Martindale's firing was truly a surprise, especially when it was speculated that Greg Roman was the one on the hot seat. To me, this signifies that Harbaugh and the rest of the Ravens brain trust were fed up with Wink stubbornly sticking to his blitz-heavy style of defense even when the team had to resort to inflatable tube men to staff their secondary. It was a risky strategy that didn't yield much again against the harder teams on their schedule. Perhaps looking for somebody who was willing to adapt a playbook more multiple in identity, Harbaugh turned to his brother's defensive coordinator up in Michigan, Mike Macdonald. From early indications, it seems Macdonald's goals are to make this defensive work more on a reactive basis. Whereas Wink insisted his men commit wholeheartedly to his calls, Macdonald will allow his players to audible on the fly should they feel the need. This style of defense works well so long as the players have the intelligence to read offenses and judiciousness to know when to deviate from script. A lapse in judgement could cost this unit dearly against better offenses.

Chances are though that this new defense should jive well with the defensive roster, especially the secondary. After having invested significant money and draft capital at the safety position, the secondary is now bursting at the seams with talent, so it shouldn't be difficult for them to take a more active role patrolling the backfield. I do wonder if things will change much for the front though. Tyus Bowser and Odafe Oweh have the potential to break out as dominant pass rushers, but both need some help - whether this coach can guide them to the next level remains to be seen.

In the end, high expectations are there for this organization now that they've endured a plague-ridden season. In reality, fans may be setting themselves up for disappointment once again. The offense remains alarmingly weak and Lamar Jackson has shown very little development as a passer. Whereas somebody like Aaron Rodgers elevates his supporting cast, it's the exact opposite in Baltimore - Lamar needs his skill players to overcompensate in order to mask his deficiencies. Just a conspiratorial thought, but it's possible Baltimore sees no future with Lamar. If so, another disappointing season from the former MVP would make it easier for the club (and the fanbase) to part ways with him. Either way, don't expect much from Baltimore as they institute a new system of defense while their quarterback has one more year to develop as a proper passer without much help.

### Los Angeles Chargers

_Leadership_: Brandon Staley (HC/DC), Joe Lombardi (OC), Justin Herbert (QB)

Ahh....the Chargers. I'd love to able to support this team as promising championship contenders. This franchise has been ridiculed and mocked as one of the league's least popular clubs for a long time now - it'd be good to see this organization get the love it craves with a Super Bowl win.

The problem is the coaches are inept, especially when it comes to scouting their own needs. Staley was touted as a brilliant defensive mind after his work with the Rams, so it was assumed that brilliance would shine ever brighter as head coach of the Chargers. Instead, it's quite possible Los Angeles put forth the league's worst defense last year. It was absolutely shameful. Just look at their rushing defense alone. I could present you with a litany of numbers here to illustrate their ugly inability to stop opposing rushers, but nothing exemplifies their ineptitude better than the corpse of Rex Burkhead chewing off 150 yards against them late in the season. Burkhead belongs in a retirement home, not the football field. To give somebody like him a tape full of highlights is embarrassing. But despite that public humiliation, these same Chargers would later surrender another 150 yards against the Raiders in the game that would ultimately determine whether they qualified for the post season.

How did Staley not have this same issue with the Rams? Well, Aaron Donald and Sebastian Joseph-Day are big reasons why. In Staley's defense, fewer resources are stationed in the box, meaning the defensive tackles must consequently shoulder a greater share of the responsibility in terms of run defense. If those tackles fail to hold in the trenches, then the defense is pretty much rendered gutless at that point. And that's exactly what happened - Jerry Tillery, Linval Joseph, and Justin Jones couldn't be trusted as anchors in the run defense

One would think the Chargers would address this shortcoming immediately in free agency, but instead, the big money went towards fortifying the pass defense. Convoys of Brinks trucks were unloaded to acquire the services of Khalil Mack, JC Jackson, and Derwin James. To be fair, a decent chunk of change was spent signing Sebastian Joseph-Day and Austin Johnson as the team's new starting defensive tackles, but neither player can be considered A-grade talent, at least not yet. D.J Reader, Akiem Hicks, and Larry Ogunjobi were on the market too, but Los Angeles passed on all of them. Unfortunately, that's not the only area where they passed on proven talent.

Los Angeles also refused to give their top-shelf quarterback any help in terms of skill players. Mike Williams was resigned, but no other receiver was brought into the organization to supplement him. It was pretty clear last year that Keenan Allen was winding down. Austin Ekeler did well enough as a pass-catching tailback, but it's not enough - the team needs a quality slot receiver or tight end able to run all sorts of routes in between the numbers so that Herbert has a reliable short yardage option not named Keenan Allen. Given that management "wisely" neglected to draft a single receiver in a draft class rich in receiver talent...Herbert will be depending on an aging Keenan Allen and two journeymen in Gerald Everett and Jalen Guyton to carry the day along the middle of the field. A little worrying, especially when offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi seems to have no idea in hell what he's doing. Lombardi's unit lacks an identity - as a result, Herbert has had to bail this unit out time and time again, converting 3rd and longs at a near historic rate. It's not a sustainable strategy, especially for a team lacking weaponry in the first place.

Such a shame too, considering the Chargers are one of the few teams to feature an elite quarterback on such a cheap contract. If money was spent more wisely on the right types of luxuries, a championship appearance would be all but certain. But that's not the case. Maybe a playoff appearance is in the cards here, but unless a good number of players on both sides of the ball have career years, don't expect anything much from them.

### Miami Dolphins

_Leadership_: Mike McDaniel (HC/OC), Josh Boyer (DC), Tua Tagovailoa (QB)

What a strange turn of events for the Dolphins. To force Brian Flores out the door while keeping his defensive coordinator intact in the same role seems bizarre at first....until you read the reports of the way he tyrannized others in the organization, including that same defensive coordinator. The man made the fatal mistake of alienating so many people in his quest to size more control over the club's operations. Just like so many other Belichick disciples, Flores failed in a vain attempt to emulate Belichick's style of dictatorship, becoming yet another name in a long list of failures descended from Belichick's coaching tree. The truly sad part is that he might have ended up back in New England too had he not enraged his former mentor by using their private texts to initiate a lawsuit against the league.

Any way, let's talk about the coaching regime, starting with the new offense helmed by Kyle Shanahan's former right-hand man, Mike McDaniel. I don't expect McDaniel to deviate much at all from the type of offense Shanahan instituted out west in San Francisco. And you know what? It just might work. Miami has the requisite talent to succeed with such a offense - Tyreek Hill can play the Swiss knife role Deebo Samuel so successfully pioneered while Mike Gesecki and Jaylon Waddle can be the short-yardage versatile outlets that are needed to truly make this offense work.  If these three skill players adjust well to the new system, not much needs to be asked of Tua, thankfully. Let's be honest in assessing that Tua is mediocre at best, so to operate in a system that's not so reliant on the quarterback plays beautifully for the Dolphins here. The offensive line has issues, but the club did spend some good money bringing in new blood, so it's possible it won't be as glaringly a point of weakness as it was last year.

Defensively, I have cause for concern. Say what you want about Flores and his leadership, but he was able to get results. When he took over the defense last year after it spent the first several weeks of the season wallowing in its own excrement, the unit not only improved, but transformed into one of the best defensive outfits in the league, especially up front with the pass rush - no other team landed more hits on the quarterback than Miami last season.

Now that Josh Boyer is back in charge of the unit, is it possible that it'll regress to its pathetic form from early last season? Quite possible. It's also plausible that Flores constantly undermined Boyer, effectively neutering his coordinator's influence over the defensive roster. It's nearly impossible for a coach to properly lead if he's constantly losing face in front of his men. Either way, it is a significant cause of concern and something that we'll only be able to determine several weeks into the season.

All in all, Dolphins fans have reason to hope for a breakout season this year from their first year head coach. Don't be surprised if this team leapfrogs the Patriots in the division.
