### Tennessee Titans

_Leadership_: Mike Vrabel (HC/DC), Todd Downing (OC), Ryan Tannehill (QB)

I had these Titans down as the Super Bowl favorites in my annual postseason analysis last year. Tennessee had just enough requisite elements in their favor to make a deep playoff run. But I didn't count on Ryan Tannehill and Todd Downing failing the franchise on offense in spectacular fashion.

Two data points from their division round loss against the Bengals stand out - Tannehill throwing three interceptions and D'Onta Foreman rushing for 4 more yards than Derrick Henry despite recording _16 fewer carries_. The former has confirmed a sentiment that's been nagging at me now the past two years - Ryan Tannehill is rocketing way past his prime. His mistakes are all the more unforgivable now that he's unable to carry the burden of production on offense. So unfortunately, that burden must now be fully borne on the shoulders of the playmakers around him. Thankfully, Tennessee understood that, so they wasted no time in trading away A.J. Brown and allowing Anthony Firkser and Julio Jones to walk for pennies....wait....what? What's this franchise thinking, kneecapping their own offense coming off an astoundingly successful season in which they were considered legitimate Super Bowl contenders? To be fair, the team signed Robert Woods and Austin Hooper as replacements, but it's underwhelming to see this club opt not to devote more resources to a needy offense when the championship is just in reach.

I suppose the thinking here is that the offense was conceptually sound, but just rendered unproductive by the injury bug. That's problematic though, because their loss against the Bengals in the playoffs showed me their offensive game-planning isn't there, something that isn't immediately evident when you look at their EPA chart.

But look at the raw passing numbers and you'll notice the team is dragging in its pass attack. To their credit, injuries robbed them of their two biggest weapons. Luckily, a rookie receiver was able to step up to provide some production.

But what I find damn near inexcusable is that coordinator Todd Downing called upon Derrick Henry to lead the offense as the primary ball carrier, even when it was laughably obvious the man wasn't yet ready to assume a starring role on the offense. His understudy in D'Onta Foreman managed to generate as much production with a quarter of the carries. Downing should have realized that in the postseason, but
