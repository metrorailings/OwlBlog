### Tennessee Titans

_Leadership_: Mike Vrabel (HC/DC), Todd Downing (OC), Ryan Tannehill (QB)

I had these Titans down as the Super Bowl favorites in my annual postseason analysis last year. Tennessee had just enough requisite elements in their favor to make a deep playoff run. But I didn't count on Ryan Tannehill and Todd Downing failing the franchise on offense in spectacular fashion. 

Two data points from their division round loss against the Bengals stand out - Tannehill throwing three interceptions and D'Onta Foreman rushing for 4 more yards than Derrick Henry despite notching _16 fewer carries_. The former has confirmed a sentiment that's been nagging at me now the past two years - Ryan Tannehill is past his prime. His mistakes are all the more unforgivable now that he's unable to carry the burden of production on offense. Unfortunately, that burden must now be fully borne on the shoulders of the playmakers around him. Thankfully, Tennessee understood that, so they traded away A.J. Brown and allowing Anthony Firkser and Julio Jones to walk for pennies....wait....what? To be fair, the organization signed Robert Woods and Austin Hooper as replacements, but it's underwhelming to see this club opt not to devote more resources to offense now that their signal caller needs help more than ever. I suppose the thinking here is that Derrick Henry returning to full health should paper over their talent deficiencies at other skill positions.
