### Tennessee Titans

_Leadership_: Mike Vrabel (HC/DC), Todd Downing (OC), Ryan Tannehill (QB)

I had these Titans down as the Super Bowl favorites in my annual postseason analysis last year. Tennessee had just enough requisite elements in their favor to make a deep playoff run. But I didn't count on Ryan Tannehill and Todd Downing failing the franchise on offense in spectacular fashion.

Two data points from their division round loss against the Bengals stand out - Tannehill throwing three interceptions and D'Onta Foreman rushing for 4 more yards than Derrick Henry despite recording _16 fewer carries_. The former has confirmed a sentiment that's been nagging at me now the past two years - Ryan Tannehill is rocketing way past his prime. His mistakes are all the more unforgivable now that he's unable to carry the burden of production on offense. So unfortunately, that burden must now be fully borne on the shoulders of the playmakers around him. Thankfully, Tennessee understood that, so they wasted no time in trading away A.J. Brown and allowing Anthony Firkser and Julio Jones to walk for pennies....wait....what? What's this franchise thinking, kneecapping their own offense coming off an astoundingly successful season in which they were considered legitimate Super Bowl contenders? To be fair, the team signed Robert Woods and Austin Hooper as replacements, but it's underwhelming to see this club opt not to devote more resources to a needy offense when the championship is just in reach.

I suppose the thinking here is that the offense was conceptually sound, but just rendered unproductive by the injury bug. That's problematic though, because their loss against the Bengals in the playoffs showed me their offensive game-planning isn't there, something that isn't immediately evident when you look at their EPA chart.

But look at the raw passing numbers and you'll notice the team was languishing in the passing game. To their credit, injuries robbed them of their two biggest weapons. Luckily, a rookie receiver was able to step up to provide some production, but it was still a pointed area of concern towards the tail end of the season. As far as I could tell, it seems Tennessee's brain trust did little to find a solution.

But you want to know what I truly find damn near inexcusable? Coordinator Todd Downing called upon Derrick Henry to assume the role of primary ball carrier, even when it was laughably obvious the man wasn't physically ready yet to merit a starring role on the offense. His understudy in D'Onta Foreman managed to generate as much production as him with a quarter of the carries. Downing should have realized that in the postseason and called on Foreman to assume the mantle of production on the ground. Instead, a declining Tannehill was forced to move the ball down the field all by himself, resulting in some of the worst quarterback play I've seen so far in January.

Yet, the club was so close to winning that game against Cincinnati, thanks entirely to Mike Vrabel and the defense. The defensive front was sensational attacking Cincinnati's tattered offensive line and racking up 13 hits on Joe Burrow. The secondary performed adequately enough, keeping. Bengals receivers away from the end zone. But even before that game, Vrabel needs to be laude for the way he kept this defense humming through the regular season despite injuries ravaging the unit. EPA analysis actually suggests the unit managed to improve as the season progressed.

If there's any fault to be found here, it's that Vrabel paid Harold Landry in the offseason, despite the man's ghost act in the second half of the season - it's a rather trivial complaint compared to everything Vrabel's done to whip these Titan defenders into shape. It's virtually certain the unit will once again be among the cream of the crop in the upcoming season.

So where does Tennessee stand? Well, it's hard to categorize them confidently as championship contenders. Even if they're sound defensively, the offense remains troubling, if only because the organization has done criminally little to improve things. In fact, it's quite possible the Titans have embraced a rebuild on that side of the ball. So unless Derrick Henry returns back to elite form and wards off the injury bug for the whole season (a stretch given his age and the wear and tear on his body), it's hard to see this unit being anything more than an albatross on this team. Unless the defense performs at a historically great level, the Titans can expect nothing more than another postseason invite ending in another depressing loss.

### Baltimore Ravens

_Leadership:_ Jon Harbaugh (HC), Greg Roman (OC), Mike Macdonald (DC), Lamar Jackson (QB)

Let's talk of another team that was stricken by an injury plague last year. Football Outsiders have these Ravens ranked as the \[franchise worst effected by injury last season\]([https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2022/agl-injury-numbers-point-ravens-rebound-2022](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2022/agl-injury-numbers-point-ravens-rebound-2022) "https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2022/agl-injury-numbers-point-ravens-rebound-2022")), which alone says it all. This year, the statistical law of regression to the average should help them return to normal in terms of injury health. That alone should garner better results, presumably. But...some issues present themselves on both sides of the ball.

On offense, the Lamar Jackson show is showing its age. It's been three years since Greg Roman has changed the face of this offense to revolve more about Lamar's legs. But Jackson's yards per game has gone down significantly since his MVP year. His passing hasn't visibly improved much, though the top receivers on the team have been notably more productive. That being said, losing Hollywood Brown may hurt, as Mark Andrews is now the only worthwhile receiver on the team is Mark Andrews at this point. Unless Devin Duvernay or another depth emerges as a reliable second option, the passing game loses some of its teeth. Perhaps Jackson's legs would be given new life if Roman incorporates new concepts into his playbook, but history tells us it's unlikely Roman changes much schematically. In fact, it's worth noting that the system that he incorporated in San Francisco with Colin Kaepernick as his quarterback is the same one in place in Baltimore, just jazzed up though with some more exotic rushing formations. So expect more of the same from the Ravens offense as they're forced to rely on its ground game to sustain production.

On defense, Wink Martindale's firing was truly a surprise, especially when it was speculated that Greg Roman was the one on the hot seat. To me, this signifies that Harbaugh and the rest of the Ravens brain trust were fed up with Wink stubbornly sticking to his blitz-heavy style of defense even when the team had to resort to inflatable tube men to staff their secondary. It was a risky strategy that didn't yield much again against the harder teams on their schedule. Perhaps looking for somebody who was willing to adapt a playbook more multiple in identity, Harbaugh turned to his brother's defensive coordinator up in Michigan, Mike Macdonald. From early indications, it seems Macdonald's goals are to make this defensive work more on a reactive basis. Whereas Wink committed wholeheartedly to his calls, Macdonald will allow his players to audible on the fly should they feel the need. This style of defense works well so long as the players have the intelligence to read offenses and judiciousness to know when to deviate from script. A lapse in judgement could cost this unit dearly against better offenses.
