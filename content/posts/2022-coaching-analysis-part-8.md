### Chicago Bears

_Leadership_: Matt Eberflus (HC/DC), Luke Getsy (OC), Justin Fields (QB)

Not much is expected of these Bears. For good reason too, considering the new management has quite a bit of clean-up work on their hands. The Matt Nagy/Ryan Pace regime left this team ridden with holes all across their roster. I also suspect their salary cap situation is horrendous, given their minimal free agency spending. This year will be a learning year, both for the organization as well as for fans - we'll learn exactly what new ideas Eberflus and his assistants will bring to the franchise after the uninspiring Nagy era.

Let's start with the offense. I have little clue what to expect. All I can say is that Luke Getsy is a Matt LaFleur disciple, which is unfortunate - LaFleur isn't the type of coach who should be spawning a new coaching tree, yet we enter this season with his former offensive coordinator as the new head coach of the Broncos and his passing game coordinator as the new offensive coordinator here in Chicago. Just lovely. Anyway...Getsy's hiring is a bit problematic to me, as so much of Green Bay's recent success in the air game came courtesy of the sheer talent of Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams alone. It's hard for me to point to any appreciable impact Getsy may have had on this offense, especially considering no other receiver was developed as a complimentary option to Adams. Tight end Robert Tonyan showed some initial promise, but injuries really hampered him, so it's not fair to designate him as a Getsy success story. But now that Getsy is in charge of an entire offensive unit, we'll see what he can do. Chicago has some talent at the skill positions too, as well as a young quarterback who could run. So even without Allen Robinson, we should aim to expect more production from the offense this year compared to last.

Defensively, I'm not certain what to conclude here. Eberflus has been seen as one of the better defensive minds in the NFL as the Colts seemed to always sport a good defense under his stewardship. But was that a result more of talent or scheme? It's hard to say, especially given that the philosophy powering their playbook seems to prize simplicity above everything else. When the defense is purposefully kept simple, it's hard to separate the influence of a coach from the influence of the players. But luckily enough, the situation in Chicago with the defensive roster isn't that wildly different from the situation in Indianapolis - a dominant pass rusher headlining a unit also featuring one of the league's best tackling linebackers. The secondary needs work, but the bones are there, so Eberflus has enough pieces here to make a statement.

All that being said, the biggest issue on this team still remains Justin Fields, in my humble opinion. Sure, one can reasonably argue that his offensive line did him no favors last year by failing to provide even a modicum of protection...but it's dawned on me that the kid may not have the mental fortitude to compete in the NFL. His pathological obsession with his first read concerns me. Some suggest that the constant abuse he took from opposing defenses last year may have traumatized the boy, effectively scarring his play style. And if that's the case, it won't be long before Chicago's fanbase goes through the five stages of grief again. After all...a quarterback unable to weather the physicality of a professional defense in his first year will not last long. Above all, players need a certain amount of toughness to survive long in this league. Fields may not have that innate strength, especially given the way Ohio State spoiled him by surrounding him with phenomenal talent.

Dreaded uncertainty is the name of the game here, dread about the starting quarterback's frame of mind and uncertainty about the new management.  The picture will become much clearer after about two months, but until then, the best I can say is that the team will eke out wins here and there in an otherwise forgettable season.

### New York Jets

_Leadership_: Robert Saleh (HC/DC), Mike LaFleur (OC), Zach Wilson / Joe Flacco (QB)

It's so difficult to assess these Jets, in part because their success hinges on just how much Zach Wilson improves entering his sophomore year. Wilson may have shown signs of progress during his rookie campaign last year, but those signs are hard to discern given all the injuries throwing them in disarray.

EPA indicates some improvement was made over the season, starting with the game against Cincinnati. Maybe Wilson learned from Mike White that not every pass should end as a home run attempt or a big gain. Once again though, it's difficult assessing any sort of change in his game given the limited weaponry at his disposal. This season will be a different story - not only should Corey Davis return fully healthy, the Jets spent considerable coin and draft capital adding two free agent tight ends and a top rookie receiver prospect. So not only can Wilson be fairly assessed, so can his offensive coordinator in Mike LaFleur. To be fair though, I am a bit impressed that his offense was more industrious towards the end of the year despite the rash of injuries dragging this roster down the gutter. But his impact on the team was muted considerably as Zach Wilson was struggling to find his bearings as a rookie. So I'll be keen to keep an eye on both LaFleur and Wilson in their first couple games together.

Defensively, things are pointing up. Last year, the unit was among the worst statistically. While the secondary was unfairly rendered impotent by the injury bug, their pass rush lacked any real teeth despite being mostly healthy. Quinnen Williams was arguably the only true threat in the trenches. This year may be a different story though, as Carl Lawson will return to the field again after sustaining a major injury in training camp last year - Lawson was supposed to be the team's signature pass rushing threat to compliment Quinnen, so the Jets may finally see that hope realized. On top of that, another premium draft pick was spent on a defensive end with serious potential. So barring yet another emergence of the injury plague, New York has the requisite talent to truly impress at all levels of the defense - at that point, the question then becomes whether Robert Saleh can manufacture a cohesive whole from the defensive personnel. His history with San Francisco suggests it's very possible, despite the simplistic nature of his playbook. Then again, it's worth noting his defense back then was loaded to the brim with quality pass rushers. Unless a whole bunch of dice rolls go in his favor, it's unlikely Saleh will enjoy that luxury again this year, making his strategizing all the more important. We'll see if Saleh can evolve from his stingy commitment to his cover-three base defense into a style of defense that better suits the talent on hand.

It seems almost loony to even suggest that the Jets have an outside shot at a playoff nod this year. But the reality is so many elements on the team remains a bit of a black box. Should certain personnel on the coaching staff and roster contribute significantly to the growth of this team, the idea isn't that far-fetched.

### Philadelphia Eagles

_Leadership_: Nick Sirianni (HC/OC), Jonathan Gannon (DC), Jalen Hurts / Gardner Minshew (QB)

It's hard for me to say this as a Giants fan, but the Eagles have the makings of a championship team - Solid players at almost every position group across their roster, coaches who've demonstrated an ability to adapt, a certain moxie infecting the team, a media market keeping the organization honest should they be caught slacking, etc. Still, their biggest weakness may be their undoing - the quarterback position.

Let's start there. Jalen Hurts was absolutely horrendous in his postseason debut against the Buccaneers. The only positive thing that could be said was that it was a learning experience for the kid about what it takes to win a Lombardi trophy. Unfortunately, many quarterbacks go through these teachable moments without learning a damn thing, and Jalen Hurts may be yet another one of them. Though early reports speak highly of his rapport with teammates and his improving numbers against his own men and other defenses in practice, nothing can be made certain until we see him exhibit better quarterbacking in live action.

To the front office's credit though, the Eagles are doing everything possible to facilitate the development of their young quarterback. Not only are they protecting him with a stout offensive line, but they've surrounded him with considerably talented skill position players, the biggest name among them being A.J. Brown. A.J. Brown is the type of player who can make the circus catches necessary to catch those errant balls thrown from not-so-sharp passers like Jalen Hurts. Not to mention the presence of Brown combined with that of DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert sends a message to Jalen that there is absolutely no excuse not to be productive passing the ball.

Nick Sirianni needs to step up as well and help his offense mask any of Jalen's drawbacks through schemed plays. Running read-option plays out of the single wing formation are isn't enough to scare opponents in the playoffs, as the Buccaneers so aptly showed them on wild card weekend. Much credit to the man for transforming the offense from a passing-oriented one to a running-oriented one while in the middle of a grueling season, but the next step now becomes fostering a passing game where receivers can easily manufacture yards after the catch. Sirianni has the horses to pull that off.

On the other side, we now have a defense loaded to the gills with some respectable pass rushing talent. If Brandon Graham remains healthy and Haason Reddick remains a dominant pass rusher despite being on a different team for the third year straight, this club has more than enough weaponry at hand to sustain a fearsome pass rush, something they weren't quite able to achieve last year in Jonathan Gannon's first year as coordinator. Speaking of which, Gannon's first year produced mixed results, to put it simply. His insistence on running a style of defense predicated on preventing big plays made things a bit too predictable. Then again, this wouldn't have been such a questionable approach if the pass rushers used their increased snap count to impose their will on opposing quarterbacks, but pressure was never really something that was consistent. Perhaps that will change this year now that the club has a bigger stable of pass rushers at its beck and call as well as two solid cornerbacks to account for the sidelines.

Philadelphia is the dark horse contender for the Super Bowl this year. Make no mistake, a postseason appearance is all but guaranteed. The real question becomes whether leadership can shepherd this team through a playoff gauntlet.

### Detroit Lions

_Leadership:_ Dan Campbell (HC), Ben Johnson (OC), Aaron Glenn (DC), Jared Goff (QB)
