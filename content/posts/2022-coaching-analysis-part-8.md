### Chicago Bears

_Leadership_: Matt Eberflus (HC/DC), Luke Getsy (OC), Justin Fields (QB)

Not much is expected of these Bears. For good reason too, considering the new management has quite a bit of clean-up work on their hands. The Matt Nagy/Ryan Pace regime left this team ridden with holes all across their roster. I also suspect their salary cap situation is horrendous, given their minimal free agency spending. This year will be a learning year, both for the organization as well as the viewers - we'll learn exactly what type of identity the new coaches will look to institute across both sides of the ball.
