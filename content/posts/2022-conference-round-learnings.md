One thing I want to focus on is this theory I'm putting forth regarding teams facing each other again in the postseason shortly after having met sometime towards the tail end of the regular season. The thesis here is that those teams that perform worse than expected in those regular season affairs then tend to exceed expectations in playoff rematches. We've saw this happen with Baltimore against Cincinnati, New York against Minnesota, and Philadelphia against New York. It can be argued that Seattle belongs on this list as well, so long as you go by yardage instead of score. 

We saw this before in the past, most notably with the Chargers stunning the Ravens in the wild card round back in 2018, the Rams rallying to a late victory against the 49ers last year in the conference round, and Baltimore upsetting the Broncos in 2012 en route to the Super Bowl. But we've also seen instances when this theory didn't carry much water - for example, the Patriots were embarrassed by the Bills in the wild card round last year, even after losing to them in pretty decisive fashion just a few weeks prior. So more work is needed to tailor the theory into something far more predictive of future outcomes - we cannot just assume rematches always favor the loser.
