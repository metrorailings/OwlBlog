One of the biggest questions about my grades this year was whether Mahomes was deserving of elite status. So far on the first drive of the game coming out off the bye weekend, Mahomes has made me look pretty stupid given the way he's been nothing short of sensational.

Unfortunately though....an untimely injury will prevent me from promoting Mahomes to elite level. After a Jaguars defender tackled him awkwardly by landing on his shin, Mahomes was only able to finish the game on one leg. It's almost certain he sustained a high-ankle sprain, an injury that takes at least a few weeks to fully heal. Without a leg at full strength, expect his passes to lack some punch. Not only that, but his improvisational ability takes a serious hit now that's he's unable to dance gracefully in the pocket to avoid pressure.

The real question becomes just how much the Chiefs offense will be set back by this. I assume this won't really hurt the connection between Mahomes and Travis Kelce much given their special connection and the latter's penchant for reading gaps in coverage. But I suspect the other receivers will see a diminished role going forward now that their quarterback is really unable to work the deeper parts of the field much. If that presumption holds true, that the Chiefs only have two vectors on offense - Kelce and Isaiah Pacheco / Jerick McKinnon.
