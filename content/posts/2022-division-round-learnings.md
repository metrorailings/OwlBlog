One of the biggest questions about my grades this year was whether Mahomes was deserving of elite status. So far on the first drive of the game coming out off the bye weekend, Mahomes has made me look pretty stupid given the way he's been nothing short of sensational.

Unfortunately though....an untimely injury will prevent me from promoting Mahomes to elite level. After a Jaguars defender tackled him awkwardly by landing on his shin, Mahomes was only able to finish the game on one leg. It's almost certain he sustained a high-ankle sprain, an injury that takes at least a few weeks to fully heal. Without one of his legs in top condition, his passes will lack power. Not only that, but his improvisational ability takes a serious hit now that's he's unable to dance gracefully in the pocket to avoid pressure.
