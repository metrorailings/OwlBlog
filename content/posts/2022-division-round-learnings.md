One of the biggest questions about my grades this year was whether Mahomes was deserving of elite status. So far on the first drive of the game coming out off the bye weekend, Mahomes has made me look pretty stupid considering he's been nothing short of sensational through the first quarter.

Unfortunately though....an untimely injury will prevent me from promoting Mahomes to elite level. After a Jaguars defender tackled him awkwardly by landing on his shin, Mahomes was only able to finish the game on one leg. It's almost certain he sustained a high-ankle sprain, an injury that takes at least a few weeks to fully heal. Without a leg at full strength, expect his passes to lack some punch. Not only that, but his improvisational ability takes a serious hit now that's he's unable to dance gracefully in the pocket to avoid pressure.

The real question becomes just how much the Chiefs offense will be set back by this. I assume this won't really hurt the connection between Mahomes and Travis Kelce much given their special connection and the latter's penchant for reading gaps in coverage. But I suspect the other receivers will see a diminished role going forward now that their quarterback is really unable to work the deeper parts of the field much. If that presumption holds true, that the Chiefs only have two vectors on offense - Kelce and Isaiah Pacheco / Jerick McKinnon.

Jacksonville has played too ugly in this game against the Chiefs. Maybe it's reflective of their head coach's free-wheeling management style or perhaps it's a symptom of their youth. Either way, the Jaguars have made way too many critical mistakes - Jamal Agnew letting the ball slip out of his hands just a few yards away from the end zone, Trevor Lawrence throwing some ugly balls under duress, offensive linemen failing to communicate protection responsibilities to one another, defensive linemen constantly finding themselves out of position to make any impact, etc.

In light of all the young teams that have been succeeding in the postseason recently ( the Bengals of last year being one of them)...I'm inclined to think this is a lack of discipline set in part by the way Pederson coaches this team. Pederson seems like the type of guy who approaches team-building and culture a little too lazily - as a result, not enough attention is paid to detail and technique. So not only is this club inadequately prepared to handle various game scenarios, but the club's also more prone to mistakes, especially during moments of high tension. Of course, if this were true, that would make his 2017 Super Bowl run all the more remarkable. But that 2017 Philadelphia team had a few positive traits differentiating themselves from this 2022 Jacksonville organization, namely excellent coordinators as well as a more complete roster on both sides of the ball. Specifically speaking, Philadelphia was stacked at the skill player position as well as their defensive front, something that these Jaguars were missing in the worst way possible today in their game against the Chiefs.

Cincinnati has come into this game well-prepared and with a few tricks up its sleeve. Kudos to Zac Taylor. 

I'll be tracking Cincinnati's defensive pressures here.
