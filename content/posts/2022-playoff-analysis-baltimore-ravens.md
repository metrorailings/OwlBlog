{{< playoffTeamChart2022 team="ravens" >}}

I can't wait for this lame-ass team to be bounced from the playoffs. No offense to these Ravens, but this team is limping into the playoffs.  This team has suffered three losses in their past five contests. To add insult to injury, a third-string rookie quarterback who wasn't even talked about much coming out of college is now expected to start for them in their play-off match against Cincinnati. Even if Tyler Huntley starts,. his health has been called into question - his throwing shoulder has been on the mend now for the past couple weeks.

Expect this team to be nothing more than a stepping stone for the Bengals as they journey to the Super Bowl.
