The past few decades have proven that no one quality is sacrosanct when it comes to winning a Super Bowl. Teams have won the Lombardi trophy without an elite quarterback, home field advantage, an assortment of playmakers, a pair of dominant pass rushers, extraordinary mental fortitude, or even postseason experience. But that being said, the one guiding principle here is that teams need a multitude of these qualities I just listed.  Not having an elite quarterback is permissible so long as the team have a sufficient number of other key areas of strengths in their favor. Buffalo isn't one of those teams though.

Buffalo will likely be the favorite to win the championship according to the oddsmakers. And I understand they have home field advantage as well as tons of media hype fueling them, but Buffalo lacks a few too many qualities needed for a team to win the big dance in February.
