The past few decades have proven that no one quality is sacrosanct when it comes to winning a Super Bowl. Teams have won the Lombardi trophy without an elite quarterback, home field advantage, an assortment of playmakers, a pair of dominant pass rushers, extraordinary mental fortitude, or even postseason experience. But that being said, the one guiding principle here is that teams need a preponderance of these qualities I just listed.  Not having an elite quarterback is permissible so long as the team have a good number of other key areas of strengths in their favor. Buffalo isn't one of those teams who can survive long without a truly great quarterback marshaling the offense. No single dominant defensive linemen, limited weaponry, and a lack of a real killer instinct dims their championship potential significantly.

Buffalo will likely be the favorite to win the championship according to the oddsmakers. And I understand why - they have home field advantage as well as tons of media hype fueling them. But Buffalo lacks a few too many qualities needed for a team to win the big dance in February.
