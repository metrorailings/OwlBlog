Cincinnati presents itself as a favorite to win the Lombardi this year. This team has so many of the ingredients asked of a championship team - an elite quarterback, a loaded offense, fantastic mental fortitude, and postseason experience. The only area that concerns me is their pass rush as of lately. Several weeks ago, I'd have likely said that either Sam Hubbard or Trey Hendrickson easily qualify as an elite pass rusher. Now I'm a little wary given their recent injuries. Hendrickson may be limited for the rest of the season as he recovers from a broken wrist. Meanwhile, Hubbard's calf has nagged him enough to keep him sidelined the past couple weeks. If Cincinnati is unable to field any dominant threat along the defensive front, the club will need to lean hard into its other strengths to carry them through February. We know all too damn well that the worst way to be caught slacking come playoffs is in the pass rush.
