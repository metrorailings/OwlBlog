I'm not sure if Dallas is any better now than they were last year entering the postseason. Dak Prescott seems to have regressed a bit. Not only does he seem a little disconnected from his skill players, but his interception numbers have been plain ugly -  Dak leads the league in interceptions this season despite having only played 12 games. Eight of those interceptions have come in the past five weeks alone. When you combine that statistic with the lack of charisma in his quarterbacking, it's hard to grade him as anything but a liability as a passer. Maybe I'm wrong here, but I need to see something on tape showing me that Dak can assume the mantle of production when the team faces adversity.

On a positive note, the club has plenty of weaponry on offense. Defensively though, the unit's been showing warts. Up front, nobody but Micah Parsons has shown an ability to dominate in the trenches. DeMarcus Lawrence was expected to be the yin to Parsons' yang, but age seems to have finally whittled him down.

Honestly, expect a tough match against Tampa. Even though the Cowboys are favored, a home team upset is very possible. I'm not sure if Kellen Moore has enough tricks up his sleeve to confuse Tampa's defense on multiple drives here. If Bowles can find ways to suffocate Prescott in the pocket, the Cowboys will end another season on a depressing note.
