The Jaguars are a fascinating bunch, no?

Let this be a proper test of the grading rubric I use to assess playoff teams. According to my grading standards, Jacksonville is a far better team than most people think, thanks in no small part to Trevor Lawrence. The sophomore quarterback finally rounded into elite form just in time for the postseason. Even better, his evolution seems to have catalyzed a marked transformation in this team's mentality - no longer is this club surrendering leads late in the game. If anything, Jacksonville managed to stage three successful comebacks in the second half of the season while not choking away a single game. Compared to the first half of the season where they've ceded significant leads in five contests, these Jaguars have shown remarkable progress over the course of the season.

Can they go far into the playoffs? Maybe. A conference championship isn't exactly implausible. I wish this franchise boasted more proven talent along their defensive front and the wings of their offense, but one can only ask Doug Pederson for so much in his first season as Jacksonville's head coach.
