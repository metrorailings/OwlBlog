Kansas City is surprising me here as one of the more complete teams entering the postseason. A championship berth is very possible here, especially if Mahomes remains in elite form through the playoffs. The only thing hurting this team is that they've surrendered three comebacks over the season, indicating an inability to close out games late against quality competition.

The key traits here separating this team from others though is their quarterback and their loaded defensive front. Chris Jones is definitively an elite pass rusher, but he may not be the only one on the Chiefs roster - Carlos Dunlap and George Karlaftis have each performed well enough to merit consideration as credibly elite pass rushers . Dunlap in particular has flashed well in key moments, just like Melvin Ingram did for this same team just a year ago.
