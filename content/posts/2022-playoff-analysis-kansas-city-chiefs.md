Without a doubt, Kansas City is one of the more competitive AFC teams entering the postseason. A championship berth is possible here, but it largely depends on whether  Chris Jones rounds into elite form once the postseason begins. If Jones can join Carlos Dunlap as a dominant threat along that defensive front, then the Chiefs have enough horses on defense to compliment their complete offense. Combined with possible home field advantage and a tenacity for staging comebacks, Kansas can navigate their way to the big dance come February.

One thing that I waver on constantly is whether Patrick Mahomes deserves to be labelled an elite passer. Even though it's likely he'll be crowned MVP this season, MVP quarterbacks don't always win elite billing in my book. Elite passers need to not only cope with pressure and improvise effectively when plays break down, but they also need to demonstrate consistency on a weekly basis. Mahomes threw some brilliant passes this year that only a handful of other folks in this world can pull off, but those types of plays come and go almost as quick as the plays that leave me scratching my head. So much of his style of passing is predicated on him anticipating his receivers will be in certain locations without any sort of visual confirmation. When that connection with the receiver is missing, his throws can end up wildly off-mark or even in enemy hands.

One more thing worth noting is the team's mental fortitude. It's a little unusual - no other team has successfully rallied from behind this season than the Chiefs, but they've also squandered away fourth-quarter leads in three different games in the process. Even worse, those fourth-quarter comebacks were surrendered against the exact type of competition they're expected to face in the playoffs.

EDIT: Never mind, I'm going to assign elite status to Chris Jones. His performance against the Raiders, his pass rush win rate as reported by ESPN, and his raw pressure numbers justifies labelling him as elite.
