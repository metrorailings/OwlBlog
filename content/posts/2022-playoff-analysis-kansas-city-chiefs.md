Without a doubt, Kansas City is one of the more competitive AFC teams entering the postseason. A championship berth is possible here, but it largely depends on whether  Chris Jones finally rounds into elite form entering the postseason. If Jones can join Carlos Dunlap as a dominant threat along that defensive front, then the Chiefs have enough horses on defense to compliment their complete offense. Combined with possible home field advantage and a tenacity for staging comebacks, Kansas can navigate their way to the big dance come February.

One thing that may come as a surprise is me labelling Patrick Mahomes as an adequate quarterback. Even though it's likely he'll win the MVP this season, we've seen a few times in the past that MVP quarterbacks aren't necessarily elite in my book. Elite quarterbacks need to not only cope with pressure and improvise effectively when plays break down, but they also need to demonstrate consistency on a weekly basis. Mahomes threw some brilliant passes this year that precious few people in the world could pull off, but those types of plays came and went quick, almost as quick as the interceptions he would occasionally throw. 

One more thing worth noting is the team's mental fortitude. It's a little unusual - no other team has successfully rallied from behind this season than the Chiefs, but they've also squandered away fourth-quarter leads in three different games in the process. Even worse, those fourth-quarter comebacks were surrendered against the exact type of competition they're expected to face in the playoffs.
