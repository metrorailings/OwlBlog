Kansas City is surprising me here as one of the more complete teams entering the postseason. A championship berth is very possible here, especially if Mahomes can graduate to elite form once the playoffs start. The only thing hurting this team is that they've surrendered three comebacks over the season, which would indicate a propensity to lose significant leads.
