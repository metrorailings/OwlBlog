The Chargers are such a promising team. An elite quarterback, three certified premiere weapons on offense, experience in elimination games, and an aptitude for staging comebacks lends this club some serious championship credence. Dare I say this team could be the wild card that surprises everybody in the playoffs this year.

The only downside here is their lack of top-shelf pass rushers. Having broken out the past several weeks once the defensive coaches shifted their philosophy on blitzing, Kyle Van Noy has now earned his billing as an elite pass rusher. But the other edge rushers along that defensive front have fallen short. Khalil Mack has lost a step since his younger days in Chicago. Joey Bosa will likely not return to form in the playoffs after a groin tear left him sidelined for most of the season. Without at least two truly dominant defensive ends, it'll be near impossible for the Chargers to survive three straight road contests in the postseason. I know Los Angeles has leaned harder into the blitz to compensate for their lack of pass rush production up front, but good offensive minds will eventually exploit any gaps in coverage left behind by blitzing players. Kyle Van Noy is only good for so many impact plays, so expect this new love of the blitz to cost the Chargers eventually.

It's possible Los Angeles can navigate their way to the conference championship. We shall see.

EDIT: Mike Williams is pretty much lost for the rest of the playoffs. And with that loss, the Chargers no longer have enough horses to field a complete offense. On a positive note, Brandon Staley may be fired when everything is said and done. Allowing his best players to record snaps last week when the game was completely meaningless was coaching malpractice, plain and simple.
