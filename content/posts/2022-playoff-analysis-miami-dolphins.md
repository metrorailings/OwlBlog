It's honestly a shame these Dolphins are in the playoffs. This team held so much promise early in the season given the way this new Mike McDaniel offense took the league by storm. But since DeMeco Ryans and Brandon Staley have decoded the offense, Miami has spent the rest of the season defanged and desperately in search of a spark. In their defense, it's hard to incorporate new tricks into your playbook when you're forced to start your third-string rookie quarterback right as the playoffs begin.

And that's the biggest issue with this team - injuries. With concussions ending Tua's season and an ankle injury slowing down Tyreek Hill, any hope this club may have had of making a splash in the postseason has evaporated. If Hill doesn't play at full strength, this team has lost its most transformative weapon on offense. Sure, they have a ground game headlined by Raheem Mostert and Jeff Wilson Jr, but rushers can be pretty easily neutralized when an offense lacks other dimensions. Unless Skylar Thompson and Jaylen Waddle have career games, expect this team to be blown out by Buffalo.

The silver lining here is that this postseason berth will give the Dolphins some much-needed playoff experience. If they can find other ways to manufacture explosive plays, Miami should be viable Super Bowl contenders next season.
