I cannot lie, this is one of the harder teams to analyze. The club's rife with talent, yet it feels this team is less than the sum of its parts.

For one thing, take Za'Darius Smith and Danielle Hunter. As long as Hunter stayed healthy, Minnesota was supposed to have something so many other championship hopefuls wish to have - two truly dominant book-end players along that defensive front. But watch the tape - neither player flashes enough to warrant elite billing. Plays are made, just not on a regular basis. Just look at their game against Indianapolis - the Vikings staged a miraculous comeback without much help from either of their two premiere pass rushers. If anything, Tonga and Harrison Phillips played a greater role in that they effectively prevented the Colts from sustaining any rhythm in their ground game. Likewise, the second game against Green Bay left me a little disappointed too - Za'Darius Smith may as well not even bothered suiting up. In their defense though, their raw numbers truly impressive. Danielle Hunter racked up over 60 tackles and 22 quarterback hits, which are elite numbers.
