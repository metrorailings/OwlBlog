I cannot lie, this is one of the harder teams to analyze. The club's rife with talent, yet it feels this team is less than the sum of its parts.

For one thing, take Za'Darius Smith and Danielle Hunter. As long as Hunter stayed healthy, Minnesota was supposed to have something so many other championship hopefuls desperately crave - two truly dominant book-end players along that defensive front.
