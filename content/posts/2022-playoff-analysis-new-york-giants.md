Massive kudos to Brian Daboll and his coaching staff for shepherding this patchwork roster into the postseason. The prospect of New York reaching the playoffs was unthinkable before the season even started - the organization was waving the white flag after the roster was stripped bare to pay back salary cap debts that Dave Gettleman ran up during his failed stint as general manager.

While these Giants need to be given credit for their mental fortitude, the reality is that the talent simply isn't there. Without some requisite talent, expect New York to look out of place rolling around with the big dogs. It's impressive enough that the Giants were able to scrap and fight their way into the postseason...but barring some serious luck, their journey ends in the wild card round. That being said, it'll be fun watching Daniel Jones and company accrue playoff experience and throw their heart out there as they attempt to win whoever they end up facing.
