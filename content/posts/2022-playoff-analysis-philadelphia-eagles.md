I feel comfortable enough pinning the Eagles as the favorite to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl. It's hard to find anything not to like about this team. Sure, they've stumbled into the postseason on a bit of a cold note after finishing their last three regular season games with two losses, but their recent downturn can be attributed to Jalen Hurts seriously injuring his shoulder. Without Hurts, not only do they lose one of their more explosive weapons on offense, but they lose the field marshal operating their offense. Gardner Minshew did well enough in relief duty, but he can only give the team so much given his limitations. Minshew's not necessarily good enough to orchestrate comebacks or weather rough tides. Other people raising the alarm on this club point to the last game of the season, where they had to gut out a win against a Giants team scraping the bottom of their roster to dress enough players for the game.
