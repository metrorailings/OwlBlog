Now that wild card weekend is over, let's revise the grading for some of the teams. Also, let's pare down that grading rubric now that playoff experience is immaterial for the remaining teams.

Notice that the Bengals had their grading adjusted. Given all their injuries along the offensive line as well as the general lack of creativity behind their offense, I'm worried Cincinnati may have lost some of their power on that side of the ball. Unlike their defense, the Bengals are way too reliant on talent alone carrying the day offensively. So when key personnel on that unit are injured, expect production to seriously decline, as Zac Taylor isn't smart enough to work around setbacks.
