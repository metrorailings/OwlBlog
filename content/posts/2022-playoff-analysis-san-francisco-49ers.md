{{< playoffTeamChart2022 team="49ers" >}}

People are hyping up these 49ers after they closed out the season on a strong note despite being led on offense by a seventh-round rookie quarterback. I don't blame them one bit. Brock Purdy's done nothing but blown past expectations after he assumed the reins on offense following Jimmy Garoppalo's season-ending injury. Sure, those expectations were set pretty low...but the kid still deserves credit for keeping this offense remarkably productive over the past several weeks - since he's been declared the starter, San Francisco has averaged roughly 385 yards on offense.

The problem with the 49ers is on defense. Sure, San Francisco may have the league's best defense statistically, but their front is missing another elite player to compliment Nick Bosa. One great defensive lineman can carry you so far through the postseason - should the 49ers eventually run into an opponent willing to commit extra resources to keep Bosa from blowing up plays, another pass rusher will need to step up to maintain pressure on the quarterback. I'm not sure if anybody else even comes close to qualifying as a dominant defensive lineman, especially when the numbers alone only support Bosa's case for elite status.

Another issue with the 49ers is their mental toughness. To be fair, it may not be as big an issue as the raw comeback numbers would have you believe. Ever since Brock Purdy has been given the keys to the offense, this club seems to be playing with more of an edge than ever before. With Garoppalo and Trey Lance at the helm of the offense, San Francisco's surrendered significant leads in three different contests. Under Brock Purdy though, this club has yet to actually lose a gam. Yes, I know it's a little foolish to put so much faith in Purdy given the small sample size. On top of that, Kyle Shanahan has yet to actually build a team capable of holding down leads against quality competition. So even though an argument can be made that their comeback numbers may be overstated, they still can't be ignored.

What does all this mean ultimately? I'm not too sure. I need to spend a bit more time assessing other teams in the NFC before I can figure out when this team's season will likely end.
