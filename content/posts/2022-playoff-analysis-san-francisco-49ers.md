{{< playoffTeamChart2022 team="49ers" >}}

People are hyping up these 49ers after they closed out the season on a strong note despite being led on offense by a seventh-round rookie quarterback. I don't blame them one bit. Brock Purdy's done nothing but blown past expectations after he was given the reins on offense following Jimmy Garoppalo's season-ending injury. Sure, those expectations were set pretty low...but the kid still deserves credit for keeping this offense remarkably productive over the past several weeks - since he's been declared the starter, San Francisco has averaged roughly 385 yards on offense.

The problem with the 49ers is on defense. Sure, San Francisco may have the league's best defense statistically, but their front is missing another elite player to compliment Nick Bosa. One great defensive lineman can carry you so far through the postseason - should the 49ers eventually run into an opponent willing to commit extra resources to keep Bosa from blowing up plays, another pass rusher will need to step up to maintain pressure on the quarterback. I'm not sure if anybody else even comes close to qualifying as a dominant defensive lineman, especially when the numbers alone only support Bosa's case for elite status.

Another issue with the 49ers is their mental toughness. To be fair, it may not be as big an issue as the raw comeback numbers would have you believe. Ever since Brock Purdy has been given the keys to the offense, this club seems to be playing with more of an edge than ever before. With Garoppalo and Trey Lance at the helm of the offense, San Francisco's surrendered significant leads in three different contests. Under Brock Purdy though, this club has yet to actually lose a game. Now let's not forget that Kyle Shanahan is still the head coach of this franchise, so some mental weakness will always be present. It's hard to put too much faith in Purdy too especially with such a small sample size. So even though an argument can be made that their comeback numbers may be overstated, they still cannot be ignored.
