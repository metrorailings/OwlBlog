Why are these Seahawks in the playoffs? Why couldn't the Lions be slotted as the seventh seed instead? I mean....I know this has been a breakout season for Geno Smith and Seattle has a winning record this year...but Detroit's just so much more exciting, period. It would have been so much fun to watch a team as electric as the Lions take on the NFL's best defense in the wild-card round. Instead, we'll be witnessing Seattle put up another flaccid performance against a San Francisco defense that knows how to shut them down.

To Seattle's credit, they have some talent across the roster. DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett, and Kenneth Walker are all significant contributors on offense. Defensively, more of their talent is loaded towards the backfield, although Uchenna Nwosu has proven himself a shining star lining up along that defensive front. But the Seahawks are deficient in a number of areas as well, namely experience and mental toughness. On top of that, Geno Smith hasn't played anywhere consistently enough to merit elite consideration. All this adds up to a team still not ready for postseason contention. Expect a wild-card exit.
