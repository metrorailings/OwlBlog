Why are these Seahawks in the playoffs? Why couldn't the Lions be slotted as the seventh seed instead? I mean....I know this has been a breakout season for Geno Smith and Seattle has a winning record this year...but Detroit's a much more exciting team, period. It would have been so much fun to watch a team as electric as the Lions take on the NFL's best defense in the wild-card round. Instead, we'll have to watch Seattle put up another flaccid performance against a San Francisco defense that knows how to shut them down.
