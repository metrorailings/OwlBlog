It seems a little wack christening Tom Brady as an elite quarterback despite the lack of weaponry and production. But watch the film and look at Brady operate within this offense and one cannot help but be impressed by the accuracy of his throws, the zip on his passes, the composure under pressure, the way he's able to read defenses as quick as he does...I can't dispute it any more - Tom Brady is once again an elite quarterback.
