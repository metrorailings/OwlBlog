It seems a little wack christening Tom Brady as an elite quarterback despite the way Tampa's offense has underwhelmed this season. But if one studies the film and observes Brady carefully, watch the accuracy of his throws, watch the zip on his passes, watch his composure under pressure, watch the way he's able to read defenses as quick as he does...then it really can't be disputed - Tom Brady is once again an elite quarterback.

Tampa's problem is really the lack of premiere weaponry on offense. Outside of Mike Evans, Brady has nobody else he can rely upon to sustain drives. Chris Godwin, Leonard Fournette, and Russell Gage have all contributed, but none have done so on a steady basis nor have any of them shown themselves capable of excelling in adverse moments. It's the core reason why this Buccaneer team has been so depressingly dissapointing this season.

The defense should be better as well, given the recent history of the unit. I know it doesn't help that Shaquil Barrett is lost for the season and Jason Pierre-Paul and Ndamukong Suh are no longer there. Those three players were collectively the cornerstones of the defense in years past. In their places now are Joe Tryon-Shiyonka, Carl Nassib, and Vita Vea. While I'm ready to label Tryon-Shiyonka an elite pass rusher, I'm not sure the same could apply to the latter two. Vita Vea has a credible case in his favor, but recent injuries have left me uncertain as to whether he can play at an elite level in the playoffs. Their rushing defense and coverage haven't been as strong as seasons past too, probably once again as a result of the organization trying to find new cornerstones to anchor their defensive front.

That being said, I still expect the Buccaneers to clown Dallas in the wild-card round. And don't be surprised if they make some noise against the Eagles too, given Philadelphia's lack of postseason experience.
