### Chargers

Zone defense may not quite be their strong suit. Man coverage seems to suit their defenders better.

Blitzing has become a hallmark weapon for this defense.

### Steelers

Timed sideline routes may work the best for Kenny Pickett.

This Steelers team has been sporting some serious mental fortitude as of lately.

Najee Harris has emerged not only as a feisty tailback, but a reliable weapon in the passing game as well as in pass protection. Stamp him as a vector on offense.

It's worth looking at Cameron Heyward as an elite pass rusher given the way he's flashed in the second game against the Ravens.

### Ravens

Justin Houston may be the only defensive lineman worthy of note here on this team.

***

### Chargers

Very clear that Keenan Allen and Mike Williams are true vectors on this offense. This Chargers offense loses a step if either one is missing from the lineup.

Austin Ekeler is staking a name for himself as a reliable weapon as well, though it's tough definitively billing him as a vector when Los Angeles doesn't really bother running the ball much behind him.

Defensively, I'm concerned. The Chargers rely largely on blitzes to manufacture pressure on opposing quarterbacks. No one defensive lineman has really stood out on tape. Kyle Van Noy may be the closest thing this unit has to an elite pass rusher - the man's made his presence known over the past several games through impactful plays. Still, his numbers aren't quite as solid as one would expect from an elite player.

### Bengals

Cincinnati's pass rush is a bit neutered if Sam Hubbard and Trey Hendrickson aren't fully healthy.

Their slide blitzing is remarkably effective, particularly against the run.

Burrow is notably efficient. Show two-deep coverage and he's not afraid to throw it short. Give him the right looks and he'll take his deep shots. One thing that cannot be understated is his poise in the pocket regardless. I am especially impressed at his ability to abort the play once defenders start bearing down upon him.

This Cincinnati offense has a penchant for running out of shotgun, regardless of whether it's Joe Mixon or Samaje Perine.

### Jaguars

Their playoff inexperience is showing entering this elimination game against the Titans to close out the season.
