### Chargers

Zone defense may not quite be their strong suit. Man coverage seems to suit their defenders better.

Blitzing has become a hallmark weapon for this defense.

***

### Steelers

Timed sideline routes may work the best for Kenny Pickett.

This Steelers team has been sporting some serious mental fortitude as of lately.

Najee Harris has emerged not only as a feisty tailback, but a reliable weapon in the passing game as well as in pass protection. Stamp him as a vector on offense.

It's worth looking at Cameron Heyward as an elite pass rusher given the way he's flashed in the second game against the Ravens.

***

### Ravens

Justin Houston may be the only defensive lineman worthy of note here on this team.

***

### Chargers

Very clear that Keenan Allen and Mike Williams are true vectors on this offense. This Chargers offense loses a step if either one is missing from the lineup.

Austin Ekeler is staking a name for himself as a reliable weapon as well, though it's tough definitively billing him as a vector when Los Angeles doesn't really bother running the ball much behind him.

Defensively, I'm concerned. The Chargers rely largely on blitzes to manufacture pressure on opposing quarterbacks. No one defensive lineman has really stood out on tape. Kyle Van Noy may be the closest thing this unit has to an elite pass rusher - the man's made his presence known over the past several games through impactful plays. Still, his numbers aren't quite as solid as one would expect from an elite player.

### Bengals

Cincinnati's pass rush is a bit neutered if Sam Hubbard and Trey Hendrickson aren't fully healthy.

Their slide blitzing is remarkably effective, particularly against the run.

Burrow is notably efficient. Show two-deep coverage and he's not afraid to throw it short. Give him the right looks and he'll take his deep shots. One thing that cannot be understated is his poise in the pocket regardless. I am especially impressed at his ability to abort the play once defenders start bearing down upon him.

This Cincinnati offense has a penchant for running out of shotgun, regardless of whether it's Joe Mixon or Samaje Perine.

***

### Jaguars

Their playoff inexperience is showing entering this elimination game against the Titans to close out the season.

Arden Key, Trayvon Walker, and Josh Allen are names to consider as elite pass rushers.

This Jacksonville offense has some exciting concepts built into its playbook. Whether any of their receivers actually merit premiere status remains to be seen though.

Foyesade Oluokun is phenomenal stopping the run.

***

### Titans

Tennessee is lacking weapons, but it's worth keeping an eye on names like Austin Hooper and Okonkwo in addition to Treylon Burks.

***

### Giants

Dexter Lawrence is amazing. Bill him as an elite pass rusher. Kayvon Thibadeaux also deserves to have his name mentioned for his high motor alone.

It's clear the team's hurting for receivers. And I'm not sure any of their wide receivers would qualify as vectors on offense.

Kudos to the Giants for going out of their way to protect Daniel Jones from the opponent's better pass rushers.

***

### Cowboys

Credit to Dallas for prominently emphasizing the ground game, given all the different ways the team has run the ball.

Micah Parsons is almost certainly the only pass rusher worthy of note on this team.

***

### 49ers

Brock Purdy is interesting. It seems like many of his plays are schemed, but his ability to operate within Shanahan's system is very impressive.

Purdy is leaning hard on Christian McCaffrey as a safety blanket.

In passing situations from 11 personnel, Purdy's performance has been mixed at best. Credit to Kyle Shanahan for making this offense work with a quarterback still fully unable to operate at the NFL level. That being said, Brock is one tough son of a bitch.

***

### Seahawks

Geno Smith has issues reading and taking advantage of blitzes. It seems the 49ers know this.

A part of me is wary deeming Uchenna Nwosu as an elite pass rusher. I need more video evidence. Then again, his numbers alone justify his labelling as such.

***

### Vikings

Harrison Phillips and Tonga may be more important to this run defense than I initially thought.

Cousins can be too nonchalant at times hanging in the pocket. Then again, it may be his blind side here leaving him unable to sense pressure.

I am still not fully sold on Za'Darius Smith and Danielle Hunter. Neither have flashed enough on tape for my liking.

***

### Eagles

This defense has so many players along their defensive front. Still, the only one I've seen play consistently so far is Haason Reddick. Josh Sweat and Fletcher Cox have also flashed a few times too when I watch tape.
