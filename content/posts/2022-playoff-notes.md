### Chargers

Zone defense may not quite be their strong suit. Man coverage seems to suit their defenders better.

Blitzing has become a hallmark weapon for this defense.

### Steelers

Timed sideline routes may work the best for Kenny Pickett.

This Steelers team has been sporting some serious mental fortitude as of lately.

Najee Harris has emerged not only as a feisty tailback, but a reliable weapon in the passing game as well as in pass protection. Stamp him as a vector on offense.

It's worth looking at Cameron Heyward as an elite pass rusher given the way he's flashed in the second game against the Ravens.

### Ravens

Justin Houston may be the only defensive lineman worthy of note here on this team.
