What a lame Super Bowl. Another unfortunate championship game between the two top seeds. Anyway, let's get going.

***

Quite possibly the most bizarre Super Bowl result was the one back in 2019, when Kansas City won over San Francisco. That was a rare case of the league's best offense winning against the league's best defense. I need to study that tape to see why.

One thing immediately evident to me is that Kansas City found success early by running the ball effectively. Both Mahomes and his tailbacks were able to move the chains on a number of designed and improvised runs.

On the drive that sparked the Chiefs comeback, Mahomes made two brilliant plays, one on a long third down and another on a third-down outside the end zone. His ability to negotiate pressure and read coverages is phenomenal.
