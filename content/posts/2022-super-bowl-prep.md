What a lame Super Bowl. Another unfortunate championship game between the two top seeds. Anyway, let's get going.

***

Quite possibly the most bizarre Super Bowl result was the one back in 2019, when Kansas City won over San Francisco. That was a rare case of the league's best offense winning against the league's best defense. I need to study that tape to see why.

One thing immediately evident to me is that Kansas City found success early by running the ball effectively. Both Mahomes and his tailbacks were able to move the chains on a number of designed and improvised runs.

On the drive that sparked the Chiefs comeback, Mahomes made two brilliant plays, one on a long third down and another on a third-down outside the end zone. His ability to negotiate pressure and read coverages is phenomenal.

The drives that followed, Mahomes continued making timely plays. With some help from their nimble quarterback, Kansas' offensive line held up in pass protection for the better part of the game. For San Francisco's defense to gain any sort of control, their playmakers in the trenches needed to step up. Not a single one managed to pull that off, not even Nick Bosa.

On the other side, Chris Jones made timely plays in the fourth quarter. He batted down three balls on two critical late-game drives. And a fourth down sack to seal the game was made possible in part by him opening up a rushing lane for Frank Clark.

In conclusion, this game made me more worried for the Eagles. Outside of Haason Reddick, I hesitate to call anybody else along that Philly defensive front elite. All of them have contributed at points in the season, which explains just how that unit was able to rack up so many sacks over the course of the year. But San Francisco's own pass rush was considered just as talented the season they matriculated to the Super Bowl, yet Mahomes and company fared just fine against them. That being said, the raw stats the Eagles defensive front posted this year are truly impressive, although the Chiefs did well enough themselves running up their own quarterback pressure numbers.

Jacksonville played Philadelphia early in the season before they fully broke out.

In that game, Haason Reddick and Fletcher Cox have impressed me more than the other pass rushers. Reddick has been showing up consistently across multiple drives. Fletcher Cox played a significant role in shutting down Jacksonville's opening drive of the second half.

The Jaguars play-calling took a bit of a bizarre turn midway through the game when the team started relying on screens and shotgun draws to matriculate the ball forward.

Philadelphia's offense found success largely by running the ball, although a few timely passes to A.J. Brown helped them sustain drives that ultimately ended in a score.

Jacksonville played Kansas several weeks later, before their bye when they managed to pivot to a higher level. So the game can be seen as a somewhat fair comparison to the Philadelphia game earlier in the season.

The Chiefs pass rush has been impressive. Not only have a number of their blitzes managed to hit home, but all their key pass rushers made impactful plays at one point or another in the first half alone - George Karlaftis successfully batted down two passes, Carlos Dunlap and Khalen Saunders each sacked the quarterback once, and Chris Jones singlehandedly disrupted a few plays.

Kansas' pass rush was more muted during the second half, although Chris Jones showed up a few times on critical plays. His only sack of the game came at a pivotal point when Jacksonville was trying to close out its opening drive in the half with a score. Instead, Doug Pederson had to settle for a field goal because of that sack.

Interesting game between the Chiefs and the Bengals to determine AFC representation in the Super Bowl. One thing to be said - the Bengals defensive line depth impressed me more than their starting edge rushers. Going into the postseason, I pinned Trey Hendrickson and Sam Hubbard as potentially elite pass rushers. It's clear my analysis was off here - that designation should have been given to the likes of Joseph Ossai and B.J. Hill.

If Cincinnati can keep Hubbard, Trey, Ossai, and B.J. together next year and give their offense a reliable vector in the short passing game, we could be looking at next year's championship team. Damn shame that untimely injuries and scheduling luck worked against their favor this year.

As for the Chiefs, Chris Jones, Carlos Dunlap, and Mike Danna were the defensive linemen who consistently flashed on tape. All three made impact plays across multiple drives. Offensively, the line in front of Mahomes held up in pass protection for three quarters. In the fourth quarter, things broke down and Mahomes was under duress on a good number of passing snaps. Giving Ossai more snaps on defense really helped Cincinnati keep things scarily close in the fourth quarter. Still...the fact that the Bengals line ultimately couldn't hold up and protect Burrow long enough came to bite them in the ass hard. I'm surprised Joe Burrow couldn't commit more to shorter passes, but then again, I shouldn't be surprised - after being hit all day long, it's only natural for a quarterback to be less keen on reading the field and more likely to throw prayers to his most trusted weapons.

So out of all the tape I've watched so far, Kansas City has four noteworthy defensive trenchmen - Chris Jones, Carlos Dunlap, George Karloftis, and Mike Danna. Philadelphia has four noteworthy defensive linemen - Haason Reddick, Fletcher Cox, Javon Hargrave, and Brandon Graham. Out of all those defensive personnel I just listed, only two are truly elite - Chris Jones and Haason Reddick.

Philadelphia may have a better line overall thanks to their depth, but the difference between them and Kansas is insignificant, in all honesty.
