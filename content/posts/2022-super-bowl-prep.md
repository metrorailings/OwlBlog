What a lame Super Bowl. Another unfortunate championship game between the two top seeds. Anyway, let's get going.

Quite possibly the most bizarre Super Bowl result was the one back in 2019, when Kansas City won over San Francisco. That was a rare case of the league's best offense winning against the league's best defense. I need to study that tape to see why.

One thing in Kansas City favor early is their ability to run the ball effectively.
