What a lame Super Bowl. Another unfortunate championship game between the two top seeds. Anyway, let's get going.

***

Quite possibly the most bizarre Super Bowl result was the one back in 2019, when Kansas City won over San Francisco. That was a rare case of the league's best offense winning against the league's best defense. I need to study that tape to see why.

One thing immediately evident to me is that Kansas City found success early by running the ball effectively. Both Mahomes and his tailbacks were able to move the chains on a number of designed and improvised runs.

On the drive that sparked the Chiefs comeback, Mahomes made two brilliant plays, one on a long third down and another on a third-down outside the end zone. His ability to negotiate pressure and read coverages is phenomenal.

The drives that followed, Mahomes continued making timely plays. With some help from their nimble quarterback, Kansas' offensive line held up in pass protection for the better part of the game. For San Francisco's defense to gain any sort of control, their playmakers in the trenches needed to step up. Not a single one managed to pull that off, not even Nick Bosa.

On the other side, Chris Jones made timely plays in the fourth quarter. He batted down three balls on two critical late-game drives. And a fourth down sack to seal the game was made possible in part by him opening up a rushing lane for Frank Clark.

In conclusion, this game made me more worried for the Eagles. Outside of Haason Reddick, I hesitate to call anybody else along that Philly defensive front elite. All of them have contributed at points in the season, which explains just how that unit was able to rack up so many sacks over the course of the year. But San Francisco's own pass rush was considered just as talented the season they matriculated to the Super Bowl, yet Mahomes and company fared just fine against them. That being said, the raw stats the Eagles defensive front posted this year are truly impressive, although the Chiefs did well enough themselves running up their own quarterback pressure numbers.
