## Bills @ Rams

Good to be watching real football again.

Josh Allen's arm is an absolute cannon. Unfortunately, it can be too strong at times - Isaiah McKenzie couldn't reel in a bullet, leading to an interception.

As expected, Sean McVay's limited playbook makes it too easy for top defensive minds to decode them. The Rams haven't made much hay in their first three drives.

The Bills defensive line is actually impressing me. Ed Oliver, Von Miller, and Jordan Phillips have stood out with some impactful plays.

Buffalo loves keeping their defense on the smaller side. It's clear McDermott prioritizes the passing defense over the rushing one. And it's not a bad decision either considering the the front seven has performed mostly well enough against the Rams ground game.

Bills come out in the second half with a touchdown in their opening drive. Where are the adjustments from Raheem Morris?

The offense of the Rams has mostly consisted of shots to Cooper Kupp in bracket coverage. Los Angeles has also tried to incorporate a hurried pace on some of their drives, to mixed results.

Von Miller on fire.

Josh Allen getting rid of the ball quickly, especially when Aaron Donald is only being blocked by one lineman. Smart move.

I'm still not sure what Ken Dorsey is doing anything different on the Bills offense. Many of the different tactics I see the unit leveraging is not really different from what they were doing last year. I do see them using 20 and 21 formation every now and then, perhaps as a way to add another dimension to their ground game - with a fullback in the backfield, three players can now carry the ball for them on running plays.

Kudos to Josh Allen for his willingness to run with the ball.

Nobody else on this Rams defensive line has made much an impact outside of Aaron Donald. They're missing Von Miller. Maybe somebody else can be imported via trade?

## Eagles @ Lions

The Eagles rushing defense is worrying me. It's only been one drive, but they've been absolutely helpless against D'Andre Swift and the Detroit ground game.

Ben Johnson smartly calling a running play on 2nd and long, knowing the Eagles are struggling to contain opposing rushers.

Jalen Hurts hasn't been doing much through the air so far...

Things don't change much, do they? Jalen Hurts still has issues passing the ball and Jared Goff is as worthless as ever, despite Ben Johnson's efforts to try and craft a playbook better suited to his strengths. Both organizations are falling back on old habits to generate production - the ground game for Detroit and the read-option for Philadelphia.

Finally! A big throw to A.J. Brown in contested coverage. It's only been one half, but Brown's already passed the century mark in receiving yardage. Impressive.

Kudo to the Lions offensive line for keeping Philadelphia's defensive front at bay for much of the game. Then again, Philadelphia may have some real problems rushing the passer.

The Eagles defensive line seems way too eager to attack upfield, leaving them quite vulnerable to quarterback draws and screens. And their defensive line can't be afford to be anything less than elite, especially with the predictability of the coverage in the back.

## 49ers @ Bears

I've barely watched any tape on this game, but Trey Lance's passing stat line in the first half is absolutely ugly. Kyle Shanahan is going to have a long season, the poor thing.

Trey Lance with a backbreaking interception in the fourth quarter. Literally just stared the receiver down. Lovely.

Jennings seems to be a favored target for Lance.

Interesting change of tactics by the Bears late in the game. After Justin Fields connected with a receiver on a heavily-improvised play, Luke Getsy opened the next drive with two straight passes, taking the 49ers completely by surprise. Well done.

The 49er defense's physicality is very evident on tape.

## Steelers @ Bengals

From watching Red Zone, it seems like Ja'Marr Chase has been the only reliable weapon in the passing game for Cincy...

Good to see Burrow still as tough as ever, still willing to scramble with the ball even after taking way too many sacks.

***

## Jaguars @ Washington

Imagine running two straight jailhouse blitzes and failing spectacularly on both of them. Mike Caldwell and the Jaguars defense may be contenders for the worst defense in the league.

Credit to Wentz for those sideline throws leading to touchdowns. Then again, Wentz threw some ugly picks and near-picks. Washington was lucky here.

Washington's defensive tackles have some serious pass rushing ability. Not much of a surprise too, considering that position group is led by Jonathan Allen.

On the other side, I really don't like Jacksonville's defensive front. It doesn't really get much pressure, even on blitz packages. Carson is way too comfortable sitting in the pocket.

Washington's ground game found its groove running straight through the trenches in the fourth quarter. Jacksonville's overall conditioning is a point of concern.

Washington seems to run a good amount of standard nickel defense with four down linemen and two linebackers, similar to what Ron Rivera operated in Carolina. The secondary switches between zone or man coverage.

***

## Chiefs @ Cardinals

Credit to Patrick Mahomes for finally demonstrating a consistent willingness to throw the ball short. He's set a new personal record for completion streak - pretty telling.

The Cardinals are committed to man coverage, perhaps too much to their own detriment against a team known for its motioning and pick routes.

Kyler picking up right where he left off, starting the game limp. He needs to do better.

***

## Giants @ Titans

Jeffery Simmons once again dominating the line of scrimmage. Little doubt that Simmons is the best pass rusher on the Titans.

Saquon Barkley is resurging into the tour de force he was in his rookie year. Amazing. On top of that, the myriad of new concepts loaded into the playbook is really refreshing - read-option plays, shovel passes, hard play-action,

GIANTS WON?! Tennessee missed a last-second field goal to retake the lead from the Giants. Amazing.

Daboll going for two points instead of one sends a message to the team. A strong message.

***

## Buccaneers @ Cowboys

Cowboys love their single-high safeties look. Dan Campbell didn't completely abandon the cover-three scheme that he was raised under.

Brady is not as crisp as expected. Maybe age is slowly catching up?

Leonard Fournette has been having a sensational night. It helps that this five-man Dallas defensive front has issues containing runs straight up the middle.

Pretty clear that Brady is fostering a connection with Julio Jones. It's possible that Jones will be that replacement for Gronkowski that old man Brady will need.

Despite losing last year's wild-card game in part due to penalties, it seems Dallas hasn't really done much to clean up its penalty problem. Then again, it's only the first game. It'll be worth checking up again in four weeks.

Dallas offensive line may be a bigger problem than initially thought. The Cowboys are keeping quite a few extra men in protection to keep the Buccaneers from breaking the pocket. On top of that, some of the linemen are just committed to racking up as many drive-killing penalties as they can. It's telling that the organization actually signed 40-year old veteran Jason Peters as late as they did. While Peters was fantastic in his prime, he's no longer that immovable object, as evidenced by his latest stint in Chicago.

CeeDee Lamb hasn't had much impact on this game. Tampa has done some good work keeping him bottled up.

***

## Packers @ Vikings

The Vikings have a nascar package where Danielle Hunter and Za'Darius Smith line up as defensive tackles on third downs. Interesting concept being employed by Ed Donatell here. I don't think Zimmer had anything like this in his defensive playbook.

Minnesota has been fairly stout against Green Bay's runners early on. Let's see if they can sustain this level of defense into the fourth quarter.

Never mind....strong-side runs seem to be effective against Minnesota's defense.

As expected, Aaron Rodgers is having some serious trouble producing anything in the passing game without Davonte Adams, Marquez Valdes-Scantling, and Allen Lazard. Too many passes are being thrown to his tailbacks, something I don't really remember seeing much from Rodgers before.

***

## Steelers @ Bengals

Watching Moscow Mitch so far...not bad. Threw a couple quick curl routes to Deonte Johnson. Nothing beyond that. Timing routes alone won't get anything done in the passing game.

Pittsburgh's defense wisely employing a good bit of cover-two to keep the Bengals from hitting on their signature deep passes.

Just horrendous coaching from Zac Taylor. I feel no qualms about labelling him as a white-chip offensive mind.

***

## Colts @ Texans

Credit to Houston's defense - their excitement shows on tape.

Jerry Hughes seems to have found new life as the premiere pass rusher on Houston. His play so far has impressed me.

Indianapolis fielding 8 men in the box much more now that Gus Bradley is the defensive coordinator. Bradley has been one of the most faithful devotees to Pete Carroll's cover-three scheme and that faith hasn't wavered much despite having lost his job with the Raiders last year. Expect that predictability to bite them in the ass hard at least a few times this year.

Texans flaring out four receivers more often than not pre-snap. Maybe Pep Hamilton's now embraced air raid principles in his offense...

Davis Mills has been up and down.
