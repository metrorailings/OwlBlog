## Bills @ Rams

Good to be watching real football again.

Josh Allen's arm is an absolute cannon. Unfortunately, it can be too strong at times - Isaiah McKenzie couldn't reel in a bullet, leading to an interception.

As expected, Sean McVay's limited playbook makes it too easy for top defensive minds to decode them. The Rams haven't made much hay in their first three drives.

The Bills defensive line is actually impressing me. Ed Oliver, Von Miller, and Jordan Phillips have stood out with some impactful plays.

Buffalo loves keeping their defense on the smaller side. It's clear McDermott prioritizes the passing defense over the rushing one. And it's not a bad decision either considering the the front seven has performed mostly well enough against the Rams ground game.

Bills come out in the second half with a touchdown in their opening drive. Where are the adjustments from Raheem Morris?

The offense of the Rams has mostly consisted of shots to Cooper Kupp in bracket coverage. Los Angeles has also tried to incorporate a hurried pace on some of their drives, to mixed results.

Von Miller on fire.

Josh Allen getting rid of the ball quickly, especially when Aaron Donald is only being blocked by one lineman. Smart move.

I'm still not sure what Ken Dorsey is doing anything different on the Bills offense. Many of the different tactics I see the unit leveraging is not really different from what they were doing last year. I do see them using 20 and 21 formation every now and then, perhaps as a way to add another dimension to their ground game - with a fullback in the backfield, three players can now carry the ball for them on running plays.

Kudos to Josh Allen for his willingness to run with the ball.

Nobody else on this Rams defensive line has made much an impact outside of Aaron Donald. They're missing Von Miller. Maybe somebody else can be imported via trade?

## Eagles @ Lions

The Eagles rushing defense is worrying me. It's only been one drive, but they've been absolutely helpless against D'Andre Swift and the Detroit ground game.

Ben Johnson smartly calling a running play on 2nd and long, knowing the Eagles are struggling to contain opposing rushers.

Jalen Hurts hasn't been doing much through the air so far...

Things don't change much, do they? Jalen Hurts still has issues passing the ball and Jared Goff is as worthless as ever, despite Ben Johnson's efforts to try and craft a playbook better suited to his strengths. Both organizations are falling back on old habits to generate production - the ground game for Detroit and the read-option for Philadelphia. 

Finally! A big throw to A.J. Brown in contested coverage. It's only been one half, but Brown's already passed the century mark in receiving yardage. Impressive.

Kudo to the Lions offensive line for keeping Philadelphia's defensive front at bay for much of the game. Then again, Philadelphia may have some real problems rushing the passer. 

The Eagles defensive line seems way too eager to attack upfield, leaving them quite vulnerable to quarterback draws and screens. And their defensive line can't be afford to be anything less than elite, especially with the predictability of the coverage in the back.

## 49ers @ Bears

I've barely watched any tape on this game, but Trey Lance's passing stat line in the first half is absolutely ugly. Kyle Shanahan is going to have a long season, the poor thing.

Trey Lance with a backbreaking interception in the fourth quarter. Literally just stared the receiver down. Lovely.

## Steelers @ Bengals

From watching Red Zone, it seems like Ja'Marr Chase has been the only reliable weapon in the passing game for Cincy...

Good to see Burrow still as tough as ever, still willing to scramble with the ball even after taking way too many sacks.

## Jaguars @ Washington

Imagine running two straight jailhouse blitzes and failing spectacularly on both of them. Mike Caldwell and the Jaguars defense may be contenders for the worst defense in the league.

Credit to Wentz for those sideline throws leading to touchdowns. Then again, Wentz threw some ugly picks and near-picks. Washington was lucky here.

Washington's defensive tackles have some serious pass rushing ability. Not much of a surprise too, considering that position group is led by Jonathan Allen.

On the other side, I really don't like Jacksonville's defensive front. It doesn't really get much pressure, even on blitz packages. Carson is way too comfortable sitting in the pocket. 

Washington's ground game found its groove running straight through the trenches in the fourth quarter. Jacksonville's overall conditioning is a point of concern.

Washington seems to run a good amount of standard nickel defense with four down linemen and two linebackers, similar to what Ron Rivera operated in Carolina. The secondary switches between zone or man coverage.

## Chiefs @ Cardinals

Credit to Patrick Mahomes for finally demonstrating a consistent willingness to throw the ball short. He's set a new personal record for completion streak - pretty telling.

The Cardinals are committed to man coverage, perhaps too much to their own detriment against a team known for its motioning and pick routes.

Kyler picking up right where he left off, starting the game limp. He needs to do better. 

***

## Giants @ Titans

Jeffery Simmons once again dominating the line of scrimmage. Little doubt that Simmons is the best pass rusher on the Titans.

Saquon Barkley is resurging into the tour de force he was in his rookie year. Amazing. On top of that, the myriad of new concepts loaded into the playbook is really refreshing - read-option plays, shovel passes, hard play-action, 

GIANTS WON?! Tennessee missed a last-second field goal to retake the lead from the Giants. Amazing.

Daboll going for two points instead of one sends a message to the team. A strong message.

## Buccaneers @ Cowboys

Cowboys love their single-high safeties look. Dan Campbell didn't completely abandon the cover-three scheme that he was raised under.
