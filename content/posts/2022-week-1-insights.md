## Bills @ Rams

Good to be watching real football again.

Josh Allen's arm is an absolute cannon. Unfortunately, it can be too strong at times - Isaiah McKenzie couldn't reel in a bullet, leading to an interception.

As expected, Sean McVay's limited playbook makes it too easy for top defensive minds to decode them. The Rams haven't made much hay in their first three drives.

The Bills defensive line is actually impressing me. Ed Oliver, Von Miller, and Jordan Phillips have stood out with some impactful plays.

Buffalo loves keeping their defense on the smaller side. It's clear McDermott prioritizes the passing defense over the rushing one. And it's not a bad decision either considering the the front seven has performed mostly well enough against the Rams ground game.

Bills come out in the second half with a touchdown in their opening drive. Where are the adjustments from Raheem Morris?

The offense of the Rams has mostly consisted of shots to Cooper Kupp in bracket coverage. Los Angeles has also tried to incorporate a hurried pace on some of their drives, to mixed results.

Von Miller on fire.

Josh Allen getting rid of the ball quickly, especially when Aaron Donald is only being blocked by one lineman. Smart move.

I'm still not sure what Ken Dorsey is doing anything different on the Bills offense. Many of the different tactics I see the unit leveraging is not really different from what they were doing last year. I do see them using 20 and 21 formation every now and then, perhaps as a way to add another dimension to their ground game - with a fullback in the backfield, three players can now carry the ball for them on running plays.

Kudos to Josh Allen for his willingness to run with the ball.
