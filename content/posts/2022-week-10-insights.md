## Seahawks vs Buccaneers (Munich)

So why pick this game to insist on running the ball more, Tampa? Tampa's actually running the ball far more than the pass.

Brady may be playing at an elite level. His passes look more crisp than most other people in the league.

Is this yet another reminder not to bet on overseas games? Why do overseas games bedevil me?

This turf is messing up Seattle, apparently. They had to change out cleats.

I think Todd Bowles and his blitzes have been frustrating Geno.

On top of that, it doesn't look like to me that Seattle's mustering much pressure on Brady. I don't even see them invoking the blitz much here.

I love that Seattle's trying to stage a comeback, converting on two huge fourth downs to score.

It's impressive to see Tampa Bay running the ball when Seattle knows they're running the ball. This Rachaad White guy has some potential.
