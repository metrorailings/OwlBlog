## Seahawks vs Buccaneers (Munich)

So why pick this game to insist on running the ball more, Tampa? Tampa's actually running the ball far more than the pass.

Brady may be playing at an elite level. His passes look more crisp than most other people in the league.

Is this yet another reminder not to bet on overseas games? Why do overseas games bedevil me?

This turf is messing up Seattle, apparently. They had to change out cleats.

I think Todd Bowles and his blitzes have been frustrating Geno.

On top of that, it doesn't look like to me that Seattle's mustering much pressure on Brady. I don't even see them invoking the blitz much here.

I love that Seattle's trying to stage a comeback, converting on two huge fourth downs to score.

It's impressive to see Tampa Bay running the ball when Seattle knows they're running the ball. This Rachaad White guy has some potential.

## Lions @ Bears

So far, Goff is having a ball of a time out here in the cold weather. Little into the first quarter, Goff is throwing for nearly 10 yards an attempt. Disgusting.

I think Chicago might have some serious pass rushing issues here, especially after trading away Robert Quinn. Trevis Gipson is apparently the only name worth anything here.

Cold-weather Goff is no longer a thing. He's playing just fine.

My lord, Justin Fields isn't built to be a passer. The fuck was I thinking, taking a bad team as favorites?

## Vikings @ Bills

Josh Allen isn't throwing well at all. He looks more like vintage Josh Allen here. 

The Bills defensive line loves attacking a single gap in their run defense.

Ed Oliver might be a name worth watching on this Bills defensive front.

## Browns @ Dolphins

Miami not demonstrating any pad level at all on two failed consecutive sneaks. Disappointing.

## Cardinals @ Rams

Colt McCoy's gutsy and willing to throw it deep. Loving it.
