## Bills @ Lions

Ed Oliver may be a defensive lineman worth watching. He's been pretty sensational this game.

Josh Allen....just no. I don't see any composure in his game. Elite, he is not.

Ben Johnson is truly a special offensive coach. He knows teams love to blitz Jared Goff, so he's incorporated so many crossing routes in his plays that Goff has an easy time finding outlets in the passing game. The running game too is loaded with quite a few misdirection concepts to create lanes for Detroit's tailbacks.

Good work by Detroit hemming Josh Allen into the pocket.
