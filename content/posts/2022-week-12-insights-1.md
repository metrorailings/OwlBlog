## Bills @ Lions

Ed Oliver may be a defensive lineman worth watching. He's been pretty sensational this game.

Josh Allen....just no. I don't see any composure in his game. Elite, he is not.

Ben Johnson is truly a special offensive coach. He knows teams love to blitz Jared Goff, so he's incorporated so many crossing routes in his plays that Goff has an easy time finding outlets in the passing game. The running game too is loaded with quite a few misdirection concepts to create lanes for Detroit's tailbacks.

Good work by Detroit hemming Josh Allen into the pocket.

## Giants @ Cowboys

Excellent work by the Giants, staying there in the game. It's becoming clear to me that part of the reason they lost to Detroit was likely because they may have been preparing for this game at the same time.

It's the injuries hurting the Giants the most. The replacement offensive linemen and secondary's making mistakes giving Dallas unnecessary life.

## Falcons @ Commanders

A power run up the middle on fourth down against Washington's defensive front, arguably the strongest defensive front against the run? Nice work, Arthur Smith. I'm starting to think Smith is a pony with few tricks.

Younghoe Koo has been very disappoint as well this year. Maybe it's regression?

## Ravens @ Jaguars

Glad to see my original hunch was correct - the Jaguars run defense has been stepping up against these Ravens.
