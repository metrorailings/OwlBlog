## Bills @ Lions

Ed Oliver may be a defensive lineman worth watching. He's been pretty sensational this game.

Josh Allen....just no. I don't see any composure in his game. Elite, he is not.

Ben Johnson is truly a special offensive coach. He knows teams love to blitz Jared Goff, so he's incorporated so many crossing routes in his plays that Goff has an easy time finding outlets in the passing game. The running game too is loaded with quite a few misdirection concepts to create lanes for Detroit's tailbacks.

Good work by Detroit hemming Josh Allen into the pocket.

## Giants @ Cowboys

Excellent work by the Giants, staying there in the game. It's becoming clear to me that part of the reason they lost to Detroit was likely because they may have been preparing for this game at the same time.

It's the injuries hurting the Giants the most. The replacement offensive linemen and secondary's making mistakes giving Dallas unnecessary life.

## Falcons @ Commanders

A power run up the middle on fourth down against Washington's defensive front, arguably the strongest defensive front against the run? Nice work, Arthur Smith. I'm starting to think Smith is a pony with few tricks.

Younghoe Koo has been very disappoint as well this year. Maybe it's regression?

Atlanta had the opportunity to cover and win outright, but the Commanders defensive line tipped the ball at the right moment. Before that, Marcus Mariota tried to run the ball, but the defensive linemen blew that up as well.

I need to assess

## Ravens @ Jaguars

Glad to see my original hunch was correct - the Jaguars run defense has been stepping up against these Ravens.

***

## Broncos @ Panthers

Not only does it look like Sam Darnold has been serviceable, but he's been proficient against this vaunted Broncos defense. Is it possible Darnold has turned over a new leaf here under offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo?

***

## Bears @ Jets

This Mike White kid has been sensational. It's clear the team rallies around him. His passing has been pretty phenomenal too, though it helps he's playing against an undermanned Bears defense.

Speaking of which, these Chicago Bears were without their defensive leader in Eddie Jackson as well as their two starting cornerbacks. On top of that, once the Jets adjusted to the passing game by the second half, the Bears were all but dead in the water.

Try not to bet against a new quarterback making a start, especially when that quarterback has the chance to infuse life back into the locker room.

## Ravens @ Jaguars

Trevor Laurence's passing is not on point. I'd grade it at a B. His receivers have bailed him out on multiple occasions, especially on the last critical drive.

***

## Chargers @ Cardinals

Chargers have been killing the Cards all days on intermediate throws outside the numbers, particularly on 2nd down.

***

## Raiders @ Seahawks

Seahawks might have some serious issues defensing the power running game.

Pay attention to all the negative plays Seattle is racking up on offense.

I'm seeing Seattle use quite a few five-man fronts on defense, with a single linebacker behind them. Is Carroll trying to incorporate Staley principles? And why's he trying to do this against a team that thrives on the power running game?

It's telling that on a critical third down from about 6 yards out, McDaniels chose to run the ball, knowing full well he was never going to try to convert on fourth down. Conservative coaching is back, baby!

In the end, Josh Jacobs had a monster game despite being questionable on the injury report leading up to the game. Jacobs and his back-up tailback had great days against this sad Seahawks defense.

***

## Rams @ Chiefs

Give Bryce Perkins from credit here for making plays under pressure.

***

## Packers @ Eagles

Packers might be turning over a new leaf. Randall Cobb and Christian Watson making plays now, giving Rodgers just enough weaponry to stitch together a competent offense.

Donkey Kong Suh still got some juice in him.

Tight ends have been fantastic blocking for the Eagles.

Worth keeping an eye on Haason Reddick, Fletcher Cox, and Javon Hargrove.

***

## Bengals @ Titans

Hayden Hurst has the potential to be a contributor on offense for the Bengals.

Bud Dupree is a pass rusher worth keeping an eye on.

Lots of stacked boxes working against Henry here.

I'm noticing Bengals are having issues escaping negative game script, perhaps out of design. The team knows the Titans are deadly when rushing the passer and they can't afford to take too long in the pocket as routes develop. 

I'm telling you - Sam Hubbard and Trey Hendrickson both look impressive to me.

Is Joe Burrow elite again? I mean....some of these passes are absolute dimes. He's making plays from improvisation, he's making plays from negative game scripts, his passes have been crisp even in harsh environments....hmmm..

Let me tell you something - these Titans almost never run the ball on 3rd down unless only a few yards stand between them and the line to gain. It's almost criminal.

Samaje Perine and the Bengals running game have spunk.

***

## Falcons @ Commanders

These Commanders can run the ball.

Montez Sweat is a definite gamer for this Washington pass rush.

I don't detect much slack at all from Washington despite returning home after winning two straight on the road.
