## Titans @ Packers

Titans have been sensational incorporating trick plays every now and then within their playbook without having to rely on them for production.

Green Bay may have some serious issues on defense. I see them biting a bit too eagerly on screens and blowing coverages outright. On top of that, their linebacking situation worries me.

Aaron Rodgers just doesn't trust any of his receivers. For good reason too, it seems like. None of them have really stood out as excellent receivers. It's clear Rodgers needs dominant receivers to really be successful. Guys like Davonte Adams, Greg Jennings, etc...

That being said, Christian Watson and Allen Lazard have shown flashes of greatness every now and then.
