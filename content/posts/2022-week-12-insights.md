## Titans @ Packers

Titans have been sensational incorporating trick plays every now and then within their playbook without having to rely on them for production.

Green Bay may have some serious issues on defense. I see them biting a bit too eagerly on screens and blowing coverages outright. On top of that, their linebacking situation worries me.

Aaron Rodgers just doesn't trust any of his receivers. For good reason too, it seems like. None of them have really stood out as excellent receivers. It's clear Rodgers needs dominant receivers to really be successful. Guys like Davonte Adams, Greg Jennings, etc...

That being said, Christian Watson and Allen Lazard have shown flashes of greatness every now and then.

## Lions @ Giants

Aidan Hutchinson has been a sensation.

Daniel Jones can't be trusted to carry this offense on his shoulders, period. In his defense, the guy needs better receivers.

***

## Cowboys @ Vikings

The Fangio-style of defense cannot be trusted against power rushing attacks so long as the team is missing a dominant defensive tackle.

Kirk has been flustered by the blitz all game long. It's clear he's far from elite. Not a liability, but definitely not elite.

Dallas has learned its mistakes from last week, opting to double down on their ground game.

## Raiders @ Broncos

The Fangio-style of defense cannot be trusted against power rushing attacks so long as the team is missing a dominant defensive tackle.

Denver can be way too presumptive at times. You have coverage defenders trying to jump routes and make plays.

***

## Bengals @ Steelers

Pittsburgh has decoded Cincinnati's protection schemes. Half their sacks so far this season have come against the Bengals.

***

## 49ers vs Cardinals

The Cardinals and their lack of conditioning really shows at this high-altitude stadium in Mexico. The 49ers were rewarded for practicing near Mile High Stadium while Arizona is being punished for their lack of conditioning going up against a San Francisco team that spreads the field laterally and incorporates a whole bunch of concepts in their ground game.

## Browns vs Bills

Buffalo can run the ball, even against heavier boxes. Either that or Cleveland is really bad defensing the run. Their linebackers have no sense of gap integrity.

Josh Allen has been pretty lousy in the first half. Not even hitting the easy passes.
