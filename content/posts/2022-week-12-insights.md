## Titans @ Packers

Titans have been sensational incorporating trick plays every now and then within their playbook without having to rely on them for production.

Green Bay may have some serious issues on defense. I see them biting a bit too eagerly on screens and blowing coverages outright. On top of that, their linebacking situation worries me.
