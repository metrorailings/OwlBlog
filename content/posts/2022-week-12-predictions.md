It's dawning on me that so much of what determines outcomes depends on time and circumstance. Dallas whooping Minnesota last week was an outcome I never could have predicted - it was hard enough for me to see Dallas even win the game.

But it makes sense when one considers that the Vikings were returning from an extended road trip having won a momentous game against the league-leading Bills. Meanwhile, the Cowboys were emotionally burned after losing as significant favorites against a Green Bay team that's been losing games left and right. In that light, it makes so much sense that Minnesota was bound to underperform right as Dallas was set to perform at a higher level than usual. Not only were the Cowboys able to gash Minnesota's defense for big yardage over ground, their defense harassed Kirk Cousins on a regular basis. That game actually has some people thinking of them as championship contenders.
