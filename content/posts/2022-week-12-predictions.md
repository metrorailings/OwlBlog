It's dawning on me that so much of what determines outcomes depends on time and circumstance. Dallas whooping Minnesota last week was an outcome I never could have predicted - it was hard enough for me to see Dallas even win the game.

But it makes sense when one considers that the Vikings were returning from an extended road trip having won a momentous game against the league-leading Bills. Meanwhile, the Cowboys were emotionally burned after losing as significant favorites against a Green Bay team that's been losing games left and right. In that light, it makes so much sense that Minnesota was bound to underperform right as Dallas was set to perform at a higher level than usual. Not only were the Cowboys able to gash Minnesota's defense for big yardage over ground, their defense harassed Kirk Cousins on a regular basis. The Cowboys were so good that some people are actually thinking of them as championship contenders. How quickly we forget the bad times...

My other embarrassing losses were the Giants and the Cardinals. I won't beat myself up about the Cardinals - that was a pick made more out of desperation than anything else. Next year, I'll devoutly follow the old adage I've repeated here on the blog time and again - never bet on international games. Field conditions and time zone changes can render these games quite unpredictable.  In Arizona's case, their defense wasn't used to playing at such a high altitude. In contrast, San Francisco spent an entire week practicing at elevation, knowing full well the game would be played in thinner air.

The Giants, though...I'm not sure what happened there. Detroit's defense ranks among the worst in many categories this year, but they were still able to restrain Saquon Barkley, limiting him to 1.5 yards a carry. Given their lack of receiving weaponry and Daniel Jones with his occasionally erratic decision-making, a loss is all but assured when a defense is able to bottle up Saquon like that - Seattle and now Detroit has proven this. But the Lions shouldn't have been able to stone New York's ground game like that. Their defensive front and linebackers aren't world beaters.

Just looking through the game logs though, I see Daniel Jones and Matt Breida did just fine running the ball against the Lions. It was Saquon who kept failing to succeed. In fact, just about every single one of his rushes ended up being unsuccessful. It's dawning on me that not only are the Giants hurting at receiver and tight end, but their tailback situation may be in grave danger if some injury is nipping away at Barkley and preventing him from those explosive gains that's given New York's offense so much life.

So forget the contest. Let's just focus on making good picks here. It shouldn't be this damn difficult.

### Falcons @ Commanders (-4.5)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Falcons**  
@ Carolina (L) \[TNF\]  
vs Bears (W)

**Commanders**  
@ Eagles (W) \[MNF\]  
@ Texans (W)

##### _Injuries_

Atlanta's down a significant weapon on offense now that Kyle Pitts has blown out his knee. It'll be up to their depth receivers to make up for that loss.

The Commanders expect some positive developments this weekend, most notably with Chase Young. Young is expected back for this match.

##### _Weather_

It'll be a wet one, with rain expected from start to finish

##### _Prior Meetings_

When both these teams met last year in Atlanta, the Commanders were able to gut out a last-second comeback. But that Atlanta team was very different from this year's Atlanta club. Nothing actually illustrates this better than their run/pass splits. Last season's Falcons preferred passing the ball on over 60% of the snaps, whereas the offense this season has fully embraced the ground game now that a mobile quarterback in Marcus Mariota is at its helm.

### Falcons +4.5

***

This is mainly a schedule play. Washington is coming off two solid road wins, one of them against an Eagles team that had yet to experience defeat this season. Now they return home as decisive favorites against an Atlanta team that's still not all that respected around the league. 

The reality is that Atlanta is not that bad a team. I know Washington's one of the best teams in the league at defending against rush games, but Philadelphia's demonstrated that run packages incorporating the quarterback option can find real success against the Commander defense.

Washington will find ways to score against Atlanta's defense. My thesis here is that their defense will be playing at far less than full potential, paving the way for the Falcons to score as well. If the Falcons offense can keep pace with their counterparts on Washington, the cover is guaranteed.

### Ravens @ Jaguars (+4.5)

##### _Recent History_

**Ravens**  
@ Saints (W) \[MNF\]  
BYE  
vs Panthers (W)

**Jaguars  
**vs Raiders (W)  
@ Chiefs (L)

##### _Injuries_

No major injury news worth noting.

##### _Weather_

Expect quite a bit of humidity. That being said, the cloudy overcast should help make the heat more manageable.

##### _Prior Meetings_

No prior contests between these two, but it's worth noting the style of defense Mike Caldwell likes to run is very similar to the type of defense Baltimore has embraced in recent years.

### Uncertain

***

It's not the best idea to take a road favorite with a shoddy comeback record. But Jacksonville may well be one of the worst teams in the league. And the field goal kicker is  unreliable given he's cost the team the cover in their game against the Chiefs.

That being said, Jacksonville is still one of the better teams at limiting opposing rushers. It makes sense too, given the youth and athleticism of their defensive front. Players like Fatukasi, Josh Allen, Oluokun, and Travon Walker can hold court with the best rushers.

### Bears @ Jets (-6)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Bears**  
Lions (L)  
@ Falcons (L)

**Jets  
**Bills (W)  
BYE  
@ Patriots (L)

##### _Injuries_

Justin Fields is dealing with a bad shoulder, meaning it's possible Trevor Siemian could be starting for the Bears. 

A few players on the Jets are injured, but it's nothing too serious. The good news is that Zach Wilson will be inactive this Sunday, as he's working through some serious leadership deficiencies.

##### _Weather_

Rain is expected towards the second half of the game. It might make things a bit messy especially if this turns out to be a sloppy defensive affair.

##### _Prior Meetings_

There's no recent meetings between these two organizations. It also seems their coaches are unfamiliar with one another. 

***

### Bears +6

***

Are the Jets good enough to merit such a wide spread here? I mean, New York lacks any offense especially after losing Breece Hall. Granted, we're going to see some changes now that the team has benched Zack Wilson in favor of Mike White. But is Mike White much of an upgrade? He's shown an appreciation for taking profits whenever possible. And it seems he's more willing to follow through with whatever game plan Mike LaFleur draws up. But whether he could lead this team back from negative game script or sustain drives without turning the ball over remains to be seen. I didn't see enough last year to conclude anything.

Let's be honest - the Bears are bad. But their coaching has been impressive considering  they've managed to engineer a productive offense around a running back masquerading as a quarterback. If Trevor Siemian is forced to start this Sunday, I could actually see the the coaches finally tap into some of their receiving potential now that they're no longer saddled with somebody who's not cut out to play quarterback. In fact, it's for that reason that I expect Fields to be kept sidelined this week - the coaches have been waiting for a moment like this to actually evaluate their skill players on offense. It would only make sense to take this opportunity to finally do so, even if Trevor isn't all that impressive throwing the ball around.
