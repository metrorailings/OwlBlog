It's dawning on me that so much of what determines outcomes depends on time and circumstance. Dallas whooping Minnesota last week was an outcome I never could have predicted - it was hard enough for me to see Dallas even win the game.

But it makes sense when one considers that the Vikings were returning from an extended road trip having won a momentous game against the league-leading Bills. Meanwhile, the Cowboys were emotionally burned after losing as significant favorites against a Green Bay team that's been losing games left and right. In that light, it makes so much sense that Minnesota was bound to underperform right as Dallas was set to perform at a higher level than usual. Not only were the Cowboys able to gash Minnesota's defense for big yardage over ground, their defense harassed Kirk Cousins on a regular basis. The Cowboys were so good that some people are actually thinking of them as championship contenders. How quickly we forget the bad times...

My other embarrassing losses were the Giants and the Cardinals. I won't beat myself up about the Cardinals - that was a pick made more out of desperation than anything else. Next year, I'll devoutly follow the old adage I've repeated here on the blog time and again - never bet on international games. Field conditions and time zone changes can render these games quite unpredictable.  In Arizona's case, their defense wasn't used to playing at such a high altitude. In contrast, San Francisco spent an entire week practicing at elevation, knowing full well the game would be played in thinner air.

The Giants, though...I'm not sure what happened there. Detroit's defense ranks among the worst in many categories this year, but they were still able to restrain Saquon Barkley, limiting him to 1.5 yards a carry. Given their lack of receiving weaponry and Daniel Jones with his occasionally erratic decision-making, a loss is all but assured when a defense is able to bottle up Saquon like that - Seattle and now Detroit has proven this. But the Lions shouldn't have been able to stone New York's ground game like that. Their defensive front and linebackers aren't world beaters.

Just looking through the game logs though, I see Daniel Jones and Matt Breida did just fine running the ball against the Lions. It was Saquon who kept failing to succeed. In fact, just about every single one of his rushes ended up being unsuccessful. It's dawning on me that not only are the Giants hurting at receiver and tight end, but their tailback situation may be in grave danger if some injury is nipping away at Barkley and preventing him from those explosive gains that's given New York's offense so much life.

So forget the contest. Let's just focus on making good picks here. It shouldn't be this damn difficult.

When both these teams met last year in Atlanta, the Commanders were able to gut out a last-second comeback. But that Atlanta team was very different from this year's Atlanta club. Nothing actually illustrates this better than their run/pass splits. Last season's Falcons preferred passing the ball on over 60% of the snaps, whereas the offense this season has fully embraced the ground game now that a mobile quarterback in Marcus Mariota is at its helm.
