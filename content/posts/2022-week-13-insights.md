## Browns @ Texans

Browns seem to love running the quarterback option with Deshaun Watson.

## Jets @ Vikings

For all the good vibes in their locker room this week, it doesn't seem to matter much as the Vikings are currently dominating.

This Jets offense is a little too confused for my liking, messing up routes.

Minnesota's red zone defense is honestly admirable. Five red-zone trips, no touchdowns surrendered. Part of that is on the Jets for their sloppiness.

What horrible play-calling from the Jets at the end of the game. Two straight passing plays at the 1-yard line. Both plays were sloppily executed. No faith in their running game.

## Commanders @ Giants

Once again, the Giants are presenting issues defending against the run.

McLaurin is a beast. Give the man his credit as the team's top receiver.

Jihad Ward stepping up as a name to watch on this Giants defensive front.

## Jaguars @ Lions

Looks like my theory about emotional victories holds weight after all. Wish I applied that same logic to the Jets...

***

## Stelers @ Falcons

Yep. As I suspected, Pittsburgh is the tougher team. Atlanta is just weak mentally.

***

## Packers @ Bears

These Bears might have a serious inferiority complex against the Packers. Worth keeping in mind for next year.

***

## Seahawks @ Rams

Why do I keep violating a fundamental rule here? Never bet road teams giving away a whole bunch of points.

***

## Titans @ Eagles

Eagles are repeatedly getting penalized and having the referees rule against them on critical plays.
