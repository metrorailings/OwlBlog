## Browns @ Texans

Browns seem to love running the quarterback option with Deshaun Watson.

***

## Jets @ Vikings

For all the good vibes in their locker room this week, it doesn't seem to matter much as the Vikings are currently dominating.

This Jets offense is a little too confused for my liking, messing up routes.

Minnesota's red zone defense is honestly admirable. Five red-zone trips, no touchdowns surrendered. Part of that is on the Jets for their sloppiness.

What horrible play-calling from the Jets at the end of the game. Two straight passing plays at the 1-yard line. Both plays were sloppily executed. No faith in their running game.

## Commanders @ Giants

Once again, the Giants are presenting issues defending against the run.

McLaurin is a beast. Give the man his credit as the team's top receiver.

Jihad Ward stepping up as a name to watch on this Giants defensive front.

## Jaguars @ Lions

Looks like my theory about emotional victories holds weight after all. Wish I applied that same logic to the Jets...

***

## Stelers @ Falcons

Yep. As I suspected, Pittsburgh is the tougher team. Atlanta is just weak mentally.

***

## Packers @ Bears

These Bears might have a serious inferiority complex against the Packers. Worth keeping in mind for next year.

***

## Seahawks @ Rams

Why do I keep violating a fundamental rule here? Never bet road teams giving away a whole bunch of points.

***

## Titans @ Eagles

Eagles are repeatedly getting penalized and having the referees rule against them on critical plays. And yet they'll still end up winning this game handily.

It's not advisable to play man coverage against the Eagles and their receivers. Vrabel learned that the hard way today.

Eagles kept stacking the box on early downs, knowing the Titans love to run with power. You can't run with power against stacked boxes though. And when Trayvon Burk was ruled out early with a concussion, he took the Titans passing game with him. Without Burks, Tannehill had nobody reliable to throw to.

AJ Brown had a game of the ages here against his old team. Just constantly beating them like a drum over and over.

Kudos to Philadelphia for being so willing to play left-handed this game, knowing full well Tennessee is the single best team in the league defending the run. The Eagles committed wholeheartedly to the passing game, as evidenced by Hurts only running the ball on a handful of snaps. No other game saw the Eagles throw the ball so much. And they were able to pull off the win.

## Broncos @ Ravens

This Ravens offensive line is bad. I mean...really bad. Not only did they end up getting Lamar hurt, Tyler Huntley barely had any time to settle into a rhythm in the pocket. Even though Denver was only recorded as having hit the quarterback five times, it seems like they were assaulting him on every other play. Something tells me that number doesn't reflect reality.

Russell Wilson and this Bronco offense have no real rhythm. It's very much a go broke or stay very safe type of offense - Russ only looks towards the deep part of the field and then checks it down underneath if nothing presents itself. I don't see this team scheming any plays attacking the intermediate area of the field.

It's clear Greg Roman and the Baltimore offense don't practice other types of plays much outside of the concept plays that represent the core of their playbook.
