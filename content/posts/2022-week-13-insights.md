## Browns @ Texans

Browns seem to love running the quarterback option with Deshaun Watson.

## Jets @ Vikings

For all the good vibes in their locker room this week, it doesn't seem to matter much as the Vikings are currently dominating.

This Jets offense is a little too confused for my liking, messing up routes.

Minnesota's red zone defense is honestly admirable. Five red-zone trips, no touchdowns surrendered. Part of that is on the Jets for their sloppiness.

## Commanders @ Giants

Once again, the Giants are presenting issues defending against the run.

McLaurin is a beast. Give the man his credit as the team's top receiver.

Jihad Ward stepping up as a name to watch on this Giants defensive front.

## Jaguars @ Lions

Looks like my theory about emotional victories holds weight after all. Wish I applied that same logic to the Jets...

## Stelers @ Falcons

Yep. As I suspected, Pittsburgh is the tougher team. Atlanta is just weak mentally.
