So in the end, did my theory about teams on extended road trips pan out? Eh, I'm not sure.

Washington did impress me against Atlanta, starting with their opening drive. I didn't notice any slowdown whatsoever from them. With precious few exceptions, the Commanders were able to achieve what they set out to do on offense. Defensively, they were the more forceful unit compared to their counterparts on the other side.

Cleveland ended up winning as home underdogs against Tampa Bay, but even that win came on a last-second play towards the end of regulation to force overtime. After the initial scripted plays, Cleveland's offense failed to score any points until the very end of the fourth quarter. To be fair, their defense stepped up and did tremendous work limiting Brady and his men at critical moments - Tampa Bay's offense failed to find much success on offense.

I think I may be reading too much into a limited sample size. I'll need to keep an eye on extended road trips going forward though, but I don't expect to find anything conclusive. If anything, I think what I learned is that Minnesota was completely stomped by Dallas not because the Vikings were coming back from an extended road trip, but simply because the Vikings were coming down from a high after winning an exciting thriller against a team many then considered the best in the league. That emotional high lends itself all too well to a lack of effort the week after. On top of that, Dallas was bitter after blowing a lead against McCarthy's former team in Green Bay. So that contrast of emotions gave the Cowboys an incredibly sharp edge against Minnesota.

We'll see if that theory holds any weight this week when Jacksonville faces Detroit. The Jaguars played their best game this season last week when Trevor Lawrence led a late-game comeback against the Ravens. Emotions ran rampant across the field down in Duval County once Justin Tucker missed his field goal attempt at the end of regulation. So next week should be a great spot for the Lions.

Another theory worth testing is whether quarterbacks that have historically been awful in primetime stay faithful to that trend. Kirk Cousins bucked that trend last Thursday, but this Minnesota team in general is sporting a different swagger under first-year head coach Kevin O'Connell. It's possible the Vikings have a fire in them this season helping them overcome past shortcomings. I don't think New Orleans has that same mojo, especially given the team holds the worst turnover ratio in the league leading up to this week. So if this theory holds true, expect the Ginger Rifle to implode this Monday in hostile territory.

Anyway, let's roll forward into some picks here...

***

### Steelers @ Falcons (+1.5)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Falcons**  
vs. Bengals (L)  
@ Colts (W) \[MNF\]

**Falcons**  
vs. Bears (W)  
@ Commanders (L)

Pittsburgh seems to have turned a new leaf with a surprise victory last Monday against a hot Colts team. Kenny Pickett has been playing fairly solid as of lately (by rookie standards).

##### _Injuries_

Najee Harris may not be healthy enough to play for Pittsburgh, though Benny Snell seems to have performed well in relief duty last week.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _Prior Meetings_

No recent meetings to analyze between these two organizations or their coaching staffs. Arthur Smith did face off against Mike Tomlin a couple years ago, but the roster circumstances were considerably different back then.

***

### Steelers -1.5

***

Pittsburgh is not a bad team. Certainly not great, but not bad by any means. Kenny Pickett is finally coming along and putting his receiving weapons to good use, namely Freirmuth, George Pickens, and Diontae Johnson. The ground game is also showing signs of life.

What has me favoring Pittsburgh here is that Tomlin and his defense seem to perform well against opposing rushers, although the way Jonathan Taylor was able to find success steadily last week has me a bit wary. Atlanta won't be so easily denied rushing the game, but I expect the Steelers to snuff them on a few drives. The question then becomes whether Pittsburgh can tally up three of four scores on offense.

***

### Titans @ Eagles (-4.5)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Titans**  
@ Packers \[TNF\] (W)  
vs. Bengals (L)

**Eagles**  
@ Colts (W)  
vs. Packers \[SNF\] (W)

Titans played well against the Bengals, but ultimately dropped the game late against them. Eagles are back on a winning streak after last week's solid rout over the Packers.

##### _Injuries_

Philadelphia's best corner in CJ Gardner-Johnson is now ruled out for the rest of the season after sustaining a major injury last week.

##### _Weather_

Cold, but not freezing

##### _Prior Meetings_

No history worth noting between these two clubs or their managers.

***

### Titans +4.5

***

Tennessee is almost too tempting a pick here. Not only are they managed by one of the best head coaches in the league, the Titans also boast a defensive front seven capable of shadowing Miles Sanders and Jalen Hurts. If the Eagles can't jump start their offense by establishing the run, then Hurts will be forced to cover the spread through his arm. Forgive me if I'm a bit skeptical that he'll be able to pull that off. Sure, he can do just enough to win the game, but 4.5 points may be a bit too wide a lead for a Philadelphia squad not exactly lighting up the world through the pass.

So give me the single best defense from a run success perspective here.

***

### Jaguars @ Lions (+1)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Jaguars**  
@ Chiefs (L)  
BYE  
vs. Ravens (W)

**Lions**  
@ Giants (W)  
vs. Bills \[Thanksgiving\] (L)

The Jaguars are coming off a sensational comeback victory against the Ravens. Meanwhile, Detroit's still reconciling losing to the Bills in a close one on national television. 

##### _Injuries_

Travis Etienne may not be fully healthy come Sunday after spraining his foot against the Ravens last week.

The Lions aren't missing anybody significant.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _Prior Meetings_

These two organizations met two years ago, but both teams had completely different people leading them into action. So that game tells us very little.

***

### Lions +1

***

A couple things here...one, I'll be testing out a new rule of thumb as to whether teams coming off emotional wins play at less than full potential the week after. Scanning through some past games seems to give this theory some credence. Two, I've noticed bad teams favored on the road almost never cover this year. Despite their surprise win over Baltimore last week, Jacksonville is still considered a bad team in my book - a one-off win will not change that. I need to see that success sustained over several weeks. Unless things have changed suddenly in an inexplicable manner over the past couple weeks, I don't expect them to really change much. In fact, their historic comeback last week came against a team ranked 31st in comebacks surrendered (only behind Jacksonville, ironically enough). 

So give me an average Lions team taking points here, even if it's only one point.

***

### Packers @ Bears (+4.5)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Packers  
**vs. Titans \[TNF\] (L)  
@ Eagles \[SNF\] (L)**  
**  
**Bears**  
@ Falcons (L)  
@ Jets (L)

Both of these teams have been on painful losing streaks, especially the Bears. Chicago hasn't won a game in over a month. Green Bay lost last week in what may have been the worst rushing defensive performance seen yet this season. 

##### _Injuries_

Injury concerns are a bit vexing on both sides. For Green Bay, left tackle David Bakhtiari is out. Which makes things a little more dangerous for Aaron Rodgers, who's already dealing with a litany of issues himself. His abdomen and the thumb on his throwing hand are banged up.

Chicago isn't much better. Even though Justin Fields seems healthy enough to start, his shoulder injury should limit him in some slight capacity. And if FIelds is knocked out for any reason, that means Nathan Peterman will be seizing the reins on offense. Even worse though, the defense has lost its best player in Eddie Jackson. Without Jackson, nobody is left to captain the unit. Furthermore, both of their rookie starting cornerbacks are also out. 

##### _Weather_

Near-freezing temperatures and moderate winds are expected

##### _Prior Meetings_

Twice last year and once earlier this season, Green Bay housed Chicago by double digits. To be fair, it can be argued that Chicago has found its identity since then, fully embracing a run-first mentality to offense given that Justin Fields' biggest strength are his legs and his ability to improvise.

***

### Uncertain

***

If the Bears were healthy, this would be an easy pick for me. Few teams in the league can run the ball better than Chicago. And as Philadelphia so aptly demonstrated last week, a ground game incorporating the quarterback can feast against this soft Packers defense.

But the injuries across their defense are a little too serious for me to ignore. Despite Rodgers dealing with multiple injuries, it won't be hard finding daylight against this porous Bears defense. Combine that with a quality ground game and the Packers should see quite a few drives through to the end zone.

Even worse, Justin Fields isn't 100% either. I don't doubt his spirit, but I do doubt whether he's willing to fully commit to hard runs against a Green Bay defense that understands his tendencies all too well. I know he'll be eating yards, but every single one of his runs will come at a cost so long as Green Bay can land hits on the boy.

***

### Seahawks @ Rams (+7)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Seahawks  
**@ Buccaneers (L)  
BYE  
vs. Raiders (L)

**Rams**  
@ Saints (L)  
@ Chiefs (L)

Rams have been dealt nothing but shameful losses the past several weeks.

##### _Injuries_

Seahawks are mostly healthy.

Rams are anything but. John Wolford is expected to make another tragic start at quarterback this weekend. But more worrying is this - Aaron Donald is going to miss the first ever game of his career. Is he missing this game purely for health reasons or are the Rams so demoralized this season that even their best players are willing to take injury opportunities to sideline themselves?   

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _Prior Meetings_

The Rams had the Seahawks number last year, winning outright and covering the spread in both of their games.

***

### Seahawks -7

***

History favors the Rams here, but the reality is that these two teams have been turned upside down this season. The Rams aren't experiencing just any regular Super Bowl hangover - the organization is completely collapsing now that the devil of opportunity has come to collect the bill due for his services last year. After all, this team had to sell its soul to win the championship. A decline was expected, but not one this sudden.

Seattle is a playoff-caliber team, on the other hand. And the club still finds itself trending upward though despite recent losses to the Buccaneers and Raiders. It has to be noted that both losses were predicated on their opponents using the power running game to keep pace with Seattle. And if the Seahawks are denied control of the game early, their opponents have a much easier time winning. I know that sounds self-evident... but it needs to be made clear this squad struggles digging itself out of deficits and then closing out games gracefully. Let's not forget that Seattle has yet to stage a successful comeback this season so far.

Seattle needs to find early success and dominate time of possession to win comfortably. If the Seahawks cannot do either, then they have to win the turnover battle. That can happen against a team as listless as these Rams, especially given Los Angeles is missing its best players on both sides of the ball. Not only that, Wolford should be good for a turnover or two.

***

### Broncos @ Ravens (-8.5)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Broncos**  
vs. Raiders (L)  
@ Panthers (L)

**Ravens**  
vs. Panthers (W)  
@ Jaguars (L)

Baltimore is coming off its worst loss yet, losing literally last second against the Jaguars on a gutsy two-point play. It was such a troubling loss that Lamar lashed out at fans on social media. Apparently, losing isn't the same when one loses to the Lions and the Jaguars.

##### _Injuries_

Denver could be thin at wide receiver this weekend. Not only is KJ Hamler out, but Jerry Jeudy and Courtland Sutton are questionable. It's likely Sutton will play, but Jeudy isn't guaranteed to play, let alone finish the game should he start.

Baltimore may be down a few starters in the defensive backfield. Then again, does that matter much given it's Russell Wilson throwing the ball against them?

##### _Weather_

Cold, but nothing debilitating

##### Prior Meetings

Both these teams met in what was a rout by the Ravens. The Broncos scored once early in the second quarter and then promptly died. Baltimore coasted to a double-digit victory. It's worth noting though that Drew Lock was at the helm of the offense at the time. Not only that, but an entirely different coaching regime was in charge over there for Denver.

***

### Ravens -8.5

***

These two faced the Panthers on back-to-back weeks just recently. Baltimore managed to win against Carolina by 10 points while Denver lost by 13 points. Not only that, but look at last year's game between these two - Baltimore won the game in breezy fashion over in Denver. Keep in mind that Denver team was better than this year's team.

I know 8.5 points is a little excessive, but history and current trends greatly favor Baltimore in this situation - a blow-out is the most likely scenario here. Given that reality, give me the team expected to engineer that blow-out.

***

### Saints @ Buccaneers (-3.5)

***

What happens when a team with an infidelity complex against this opponent runs into that opponent starting a major liability at quarterback? I have no idea. So for that reason, I'm staying away from this one. But I'll keep an eye on this one.

***

### Dolphins @ 49ers (-4)

##### _Recent History_

**Dolphins**  
vs. Browns (W)  
BYE  
vs. Texans (W)

**49ers**  
@ Cardinals (W)  
vs. Saints (W)

Both franchises are on extended winning streaks.
