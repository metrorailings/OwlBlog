So in the end, did my theory about teams on extended road trips pan out? Eh, I'm not sure.

Washington did impress me against Atlanta, starting with their opening drive. I didn't notice any slowdown whatsoever from them. With precious few exceptions, the Commanders were able to achieve what they set out to do on offense. Defensively, they were the more forceful unit compared to their counterparts on the other side.

Cleveland ended up winning as home underdogs against Tampa Bay, but even that win came on a last-second play towards the end of regulation to force overtime. After the initial scripted plays, Cleveland's offense failed to score any points until the very end of the fourth quarter. To be fair, their defense stepped up and did tremendous work limiting Brady and his men at critical moments - Tampa Bay's offense failed to find much success on offense.

I think I may be reading too much into a limited sample size. I'll need to keep an eye on extended road trips going forward though, but I don't expect to find anything conclusive. If anything, I think what I learned is that Minnesota was completely stomped by Dallas not because the Vikings were coming back from an extended road trip, but simply because the Vikings were coming down from a high after winning an exciting thriller against a team many then considered the best in the league. That emotional high lends itself all too well to a lack of effort the week after. On top of that, Dallas was bitter after blowing a lead against McCarthy's former team in Green Bay. So that contrast of emotions gave the Cowboys an incredibly sharp edge against Minnesota.

We'll see if that theory holds any weight this week when Jacksonville faces Detroit. The Jaguars played their best game this season last week when Trevor Lawrence led a late-game comeback against the Ravens. Emotions ran rampant across the field down in Duval County once Justin Tucker missed his field goal attempt at the end of regulation. So next week should be a great spot for the Lions.

Another theory worth testing is whether quarterbacks that have historically been awful in primetime stay faithful to that trend. Kirk Cousins bucked that trend last Thursday, but this Minnesota team in general is sporting a different swagger under first-year head coach Kevin O'Connell. It's possible the Vikings have a fire in them this season helping them overcome past shortcomings. I don't think New Orleans has that same mojo, especially given the team holds the worst turnover ratio in the league leading up to this week. So if this theory holds true, expect the Ginger Rifle to implode this Monday in hostile territory.

Anyway, let's roll forward into some picks here...
