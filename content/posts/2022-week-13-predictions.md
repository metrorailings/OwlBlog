So in the end, did my theory about teams on extended road trips pan out? Eh, I'm not sure.

Washington did impress me against Atlanta, starting with their opening drive. I didn't notice any slowdown whatsoever from them. With precious few exceptions, the Commanders were able to achieve what they set out to do on offense. Defensively, they were the more forceful unit compared to their counterparts on the other side.

Cleveland ended up winning as home underdogs against Tampa Bay, but even that win came on a last-second play towards the end of regulation to force overtime. After the initial scripted plays, Cleveland's offense failed to score any points until the very end of the fourth quarter. To be fair, their defense stepped up and did tremendous work limiting Brady and his men at critical moments - Tampa Bay's offense failed to find much success on offense.

I think I may be reading too much into a limited sample size. I'll need to keep an eye on extended road trips going forward though, but I don't expect to find anything conclusive. If anything, I think what I learned is that Minnesota was completely stomped by Dallas not because the Vikings were coming back from an extended road trip, but simply because the Vikings were coming down from a high after winning an exciting thriller against a team many then considered the best in the league. That emotional high lends itself all too well to a lack of effort the week after. On top of that, Dallas was bitter after blowing a lead against McCarthy's former team in Green Bay. So that contrast of emotions gave the Cowboys an incredibly sharp edge against Minnesota.

We'll see if that theory holds any weight this week when Jacksonville faces Detroit. The Jaguars played their best game this season last week when Trevor Lawrence led a late-game comeback against the Ravens. Emotions ran rampant across the field down in Duval County once Justin Tucker missed his field goal attempt at the end of regulation. So next week should be a great spot for the Lions.

Another theory worth testing is whether quarterbacks that have historically been awful in primetime stay faithful to that trend. Kirk Cousins bucked that trend last Thursday, but this Minnesota team in general is sporting a different swagger under first-year head coach Kevin O'Connell. It's possible the Vikings have a fire in them this season helping them overcome past shortcomings. I don't think New Orleans has that same mojo, especially given the team holds the worst turnover ratio in the league leading up to this week. So if this theory holds true, expect the Ginger Rifle to implode this Monday in hostile territory.

Anyway, let's roll forward into some picks here...

***

### Steelers @ Falcons (+1.5)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Falcons**  
vs. Bengals (L)  
@ Colts (W) \[MNF\]

**Falcons**  
vs. Bears (W)  
@ Commanders (L)

Pittsburgh seems to have turned a new leaf with a surprise victory last Monday against a hot Colts team. Kenny Pickett has been playing fairly solid as of lately (by rookie standards).

##### _Injuries_

Najee Harris may not be healthy enough to play for Pittsburgh, though Benny Snell seems to have performed well in relief duty last week.

##### _Weather_

Dome game

##### _Prior Meetings_

No recent meetings to analyze between these two organizations or their coaching staffs. Arthur Smith did face off against Mike Tomlin a couple years ago, but the roster circumstances were considerably different back then.

***

### Steelers -1.5

***

Pittsburgh is not a bad team. Certainly not great, but not bad by any means. Kenny Pickett is finally coming along and putting his receiving weapons to good use, namely Freirmuth, George Pickens, and Diontae Johnson. The ground game is also showing signs of life.

What has me favoring Pittsburgh here is that Tomlin and his defense seem to perform well against opposing rushers, although the way Jonathan Taylor was able to find success steadily last week has me a bit wary. Atlanta won't be so easily denied rushing the game, but I expect the Steelers to snuff them on a few drives. The question then becomes whether Pittsburgh can tally up three of four scores on offense.

***

### Titans @ Eagles (-4.5)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Titans**  
@ Packers \[TNF\] (W)  
vs. Bengals (L)

**Eagles**  
@ Colts (W)  
vs. Packers \[SNF\] (W)

Titans played well against the Bengals, but ultimately dropped the game late against them. Eagles are back on a winning streak after last week's solid rout over the Packers.

##### _Injuries_

Philadelphia's best corner in CJ Gardner-Johnson is now ruled out for the rest of the season after sustaining a major injury last week.

##### _Weather_

Cold, but not freezing

##### _Prior Meetings_

No history worth noting between these two clubs or their managers.

***

### Titans +4.5

***

Tennessee is almost too tempting a pick here. Not only are they managed by one of the best head coaches in the league, the Titans also boast a defensive front seven capable of shadowing Miles Sanders and Jalen Hurts. If the Eagles can't jump start their offense by establishing the run, then Hurts will be forced to cover the spread through his arm. Forgive me if I'm a bit skeptical that he'll be able to pull that off. Sure, he can do just enough to win the game, but 4.5 points may be a bit too wide a lead for a Philadelphia squad not exactly lighting up the world through the pass.

So give me the single best defense from a run success perspective here.

### Jaguars @ Lions (+1)

***

##### _Recent History_

**Jaguars**  
@ Chiefs (L)  
BYE  
vs. Ravens (W)

**Lions**  
@ Giants (W)  
vs. Bills \[Thanksgiving\] (L)

The Jaguars are coming off a sensational comeback victory against the Ravens. Meanwhile, Detroit's still reconciling losing to the Bills in a close one on national television.
