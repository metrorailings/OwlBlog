## Vikings @ Lions

Lions with some creative play-calling. Ben Johnson has done some good work bringing life back into this offense.

Jared Goff looking very good too, so long as he's not being pressured.

Harrison Smith not playing truly hurts coverage.

Jared Goff may be making a case for elite status.

Minnesota is experimenting a bit too much against Detroit, despite Detroit being objectively competent opponents. A play that was supposed to be a Dalvin Cook pass to the end zone ended up being a turnover. A fourth down attempt in their own territory ended up failing, and Detroit was able to convert that turnover into a touchdown shortly afterwards.

## Ravens @ Steelers

Need to pay attention as to how Baltimore's defense was able to take over this game.

***

## Chiefs @ Broncos

Patrick Mahomes with another fantastic throw leading to a surprise touchdown. Chiefs are running up points against the Broncos early.

Willie Gay with a pick-six. Can we retire Russ?

***

## Buccaneers @ 49ers

Jordan Willis with a big play forcing a hold to take away a Tampa touchdown.

Purdy got some balls on him.

***

## Dolphins @ Chargers

Christian Wilkins is something special defending the run. Then again, Los Angeles is truly awful running the ball.

The Chargers are using the Dolphins and their blitz-heavy tendencies against them.

Christian Wilkins has been sensational overall.

This rebuilt Chargers coverage has been phenomenal too. Then again, it's not too hard game-planning against Tua when you know he greatly prefers throwing into the intermediate middle of the field.

Take away that intermediate middle of the field and this Miami passing offense turns a little too ugly for my liking. It's telling that this is the first time in the last 4 games that Tua has actually scrambled with the ball.
