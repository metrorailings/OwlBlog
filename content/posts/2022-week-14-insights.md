## Vikings @ Lions

Lions with some creative play-calling. Ben Johnson has done some good work bringing life back into this offense.

Jared Goff looking very good too, so long as he's not being pressured.

Harrison Smith not playing truly hurts coverage.

Jared Goff may be making a case for elite status. That being said, it's pretty clear Minnesota's defense spent more time studying the ground game than their passing attack. Goff is having a little too easy a time attacking the whole field, from the flat to the deep backfield.

Minnesota is experimenting a bit too much against Detroit, despite Detroit being objectively competent opponents. A play that was supposed to be a Dalvin Cook pass to the end zone ended up being a turnover. A fourth down attempt in their own territory ended up failing, and Detroit was able to convert that turnover into a touchdown shortly afterwards.

Meanwhile, Detroit experiments with a fake punt and it works. spectacularly. It helps to have momentum while playing at home.

For Detroit, it seems Amon-Ra St. Brown and DeAndre Swift can be considered vectors. I'm not sure if anybody else quite qualifies yet. Josh Reynolds and DJ Chark are making a case for their candidacy.

I genuinely think Minnesota only has one vector on offense. And that is Justin Jefferson. TJ Hockenson, Adam Thielan, and Dalvin Cook don't quite qualify yet in my book going by this game alone. Cook might have the best chance of impressing me.

Za'Darius Smith is an elite pass rusher. Not quite sure anybody else on Minnesota's front deserves the same billing.

Danielle Hunter is good in coverage though.

## Ravens @ Steelers

Need to pay attention as to how Baltimore's defense was able to take over this game.

***

## Chiefs @ Broncos

Patrick Mahomes with another fantastic throw leading to a surprise touchdown. Chiefs are running up points against the Broncos early.

Willie Gay with a pick-six. Can we retire Russ?

***

## Buccaneers @ 49ers

Jordan Willis with a big play forcing a hold to take away a Tampa touchdown.

Purdy got some balls on him.

***

## Dolphins @ Chargers

Christian Wilkins is something special defending the run. Then again, Los Angeles is truly awful running the ball.

The Chargers are using the Dolphins and their blitz-heavy tendencies against them.

Christian Wilkins has been sensational overall.

This rebuilt Chargers coverage has been phenomenal too. Then again, it's not too hard game-planning against Tua when you know he greatly prefers throwing into the intermediate middle of the field.

Take away that intermediate middle of the field and this Miami passing offense turns a little too ugly for my liking. It's telling that this is the first time in the last 4 games that Tua has actually scrambled with the ball.

## Jaguars @ Titans

Ryan Tannehill seems to be leaning on Westbrook-Ikhine here to carry the load in the receiving game.

Without Denico Autry and a fully healthy Jeffrey Simmons, this Titans pass rush is non-existant.

Tennessee's base man-coverage isn't getting the job done, especially when they're down a starter or two.

Trevor Lawrence is acting bolder than normal, throwing balls into very tight windows.

Credit to Jacksonville for dedicating more offensive snaps to the passing game instead of the rushing attack, at least until the game was well out of reach for Tennessee. It's proof that Doug Pederson and his people can adapt if needed.

Evan Engram may be finally breaking out as this team's top offensive weapon opposite Travis Etienne.

None of Tennessee's receivers have shown themselves to be capable vectors here.
