## Vikings @ Lions

Lions with some creative play-calling. Ben Johnson has done some good work bringing life back into this offense.

Jared Goff looking very good too, so long as he's not being pressured.

***

## Ravens @ Steelers

Need to pay attention as to how Baltimore's defense was able to take over this game.

***

## Chiefs @ Broncos

Patrick Mahomes with another fantastic throw leading to a surprise touchdown. Chiefs are running up points against the Broncos early.

Willie Gay with a pick-six. Can we retire Russ?
