These Vikings are just a bad team. I'm not sure how exactly you give up 17 points in the first quarter to an Indianapolis team that's truly underwhelming in so many respects, but Minnesota managed to pull that off.

Where is Minnesota's pass rush? I do not see them at all.

It's clear the Vikings came into this game not caring one bit at all. For a team that's used to winning tight games, this spread may have been way too wide for them. Pretty sad too, all things considering. This team's mentality is centered more on winning without any regard for the score differential.

Lesson learned - **for teams known for narrow victories, never pick them if they're greater than 3 point favorites.**

As much criticism as Greg Roman deserves for not straying too far from his formulaic approach, you have to give credit to his ability to adjust. The opening Ravens drive in the second half was dominated almost entirely by running plays.

You know, it's quite possible Cleveland might have had the emotional edge here given Baltimore won a close one over their nemesis last week Steelers whereas Cleveland lost pretty resoundingly against another division rival last week. Baltimore's victory was all the more impressive considering the Ravens were down to their third-string quarterback late in the third quarter. If Baltimore is recovering from an emotional high, it would explain how Justin Tucker missed two field goals, the tailbacks fumbled the ball twice, and the team embarrassed themselves trying to convert on multiple fourth downs.

That being said, I wasn't wrong about my assessment of Cleveland. Sure, the weather didn't help, but it was still a mostly poor outing from Deshaun Watson. Without any help from their ground game, their offense had issues sustaining production. It was only through the Ravens gifting them so many ridiculous turnovers that the Browns won by a decent margin.

Lesson learned - **when assessing recent history, also note whether teams may be emotionally spent from their last game.**

It seemed obvious to me that Miami would commit to the running game more today. And yet the Bills brain trust seems genuinely surprised at this. And their defense over the middle of the field hasn't exactly been rock solid, as evidenced by Tua connecting with the Penguin for the touchdown. On top of that, Buffalo is intently avoiding pressing the receivers at the line of scrimmage, which makes no sense - the Chargers were incredibly successful last week in part by doing just that.

I think in the event where an underdog can surprise an opponent with a new dimension on offense, then the advantage goes to the underdog. Lots of rules I'm learning today on what is an otherwise depressing day of football for me.

Miami has an additional vector on offense in the form of its ground game.

Lesson learned - **teams that have recently incorporated other dimensions of offense into their game plan have an edge against defenses.** It's possible this fact may go a long way towards explaining teams going into the playoffs "hot".

Tampa Bay is trying to incorporate some new concepts in their playbook - pre-snap motions, play-action, misdirection plays. Not only that, but the offense is relying on its ground game far more than otherwise normal for them. So far, these changes have been working spectacularly in their favor in the first half of their contest against Cincy.

The problem becomes that the Buccaneers seem to have given up on all those new concepts in the second half, similar to the way Miami gave up on the ground game in the second half despite seeing so much success with that strategy earlier. It's very difficult for a team to change its stripes this late in the season. In the event of Buffalo, they barely missed doing just enough to comfortably cover the spread. In this game, Cincinnati was able to rally back from a 17-point deficit and cover the spread in the process.

Jacksonville's offense has really developed into something sophisticated. Their use of misdirection in particular is admirable.

Kelvin Joseph seems to be a liability in coverage, especially given the way Jacksonville has been targeting him. He's given up two touchdowns.

Dak Prescott seems to get easily bothered by pressure. His inability to escape pressure also worries me considerably.
