These Vikings are just a bad team. I'm not sure how exactly you give up 17 points in the first quarter to an Indianapolis team that's truly underwhelming in so many respects, but Minnesota managed to pull that off. 

Where is Minnesota's pass rush? I do not see them at all.

It's clear the Vikings came into this game not caring one bit at all. For a team that's used to winning tight games, this spread may have been way too wide for them. Pretty sad too, all things considering. This team's mentality is centered more on winning without any regard for the score differential.

Lesson learned - **for teams known for narrow victories, never pick them if they're greater than 3 point favorites.**
