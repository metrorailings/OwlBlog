These Vikings are just a bad team. I'm not sure how exactly you give up 17 points in the first quarter to an Indianapolis team that's truly underwhelming in so many respects, but Minnesota managed to pull that off. 

Where is Minnesota's pass rush? I do not see them at all.

It's clear the Vikings came into this game not caring one bit at all. For a team that's used to winning tight games, this spread may have been way too wide for them. Pretty sad too, all things considering. This team's mentality is centered more on winning without any regard for the score differential.

Lesson learned - **for teams known for narrow victories, never pick them if they're greater than 3 point favorites.**

As much criticism as Greg Roman deserves for not straying too far from his formulaic approach, you have to give credit to his ability to adjust. The opening Ravens drive in the second half was dominated almost entirely by running plays.

You know, it's quite possible Cleveland might have had the emotional edge here given Baltimore won a close one over their nemesis last week Steelers whereas Cleveland lost pretty resoundingly against another division rival last week. Baltimore's victory was all the more impressive considering the Ravens were down to their third-string quarterback late in the third quarter. If Baltimore is recovering from an emotional high, it would explain how Justin Tucker missed two field goals, the tailbacks fumbled the ball twice, and the team embarrassed themselves trying to convert on multiple fourth downs.

That being said, I wasn't wrong about my assessment of Cleveland. Sure, the weather didn't help, but it was still a mostly poor outing from Deshaun Watson. Without their ground game, their offense had issues sustaining production. It was only through the Ravens gifting them so many ridiculous turnovers that the Browns won by a decent margin.
