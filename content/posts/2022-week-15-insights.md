These Vikings are just a bad team. I'm not sure how exactly you give up 17 points in the first quarter to an Indianapolis team that's truly underwhelming in so many respects, but Minnesota managed to pull that off. 

Where is Minnesota's pass rush? I do not see them at all.

Maybe the Colts found some resolve over the bye.
