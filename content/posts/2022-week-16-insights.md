I must watch the Patriots as they attempted to mount a comeback against the Bengals. It seems queer considering the Bengals were so thoroughly dominating the Patriots.

Giants almost mounted a comeback despite the turnovers. Impressive.

This Packers passing offense is truly ugly. No rhythm. I see some clever misdirection concepts, but it's not enough against this feisty Miami defense. Receivers are having issues separating from defenders. It's a good thing they'll likely miss the playoffs. But real improvement is a good ways away unless they splurge in free agency.

**Why can I not remember that when bad teams are favored on the road, always pick the home team? Look at the Rams clobbering Denver despite being 3-point underdogs.**
