I must watch the Patriots as they attempted to mount a comeback against the Bengals. It seems queer considering the Bengals were so thoroughly dominating the Patriots.

Giants almost mounted a comeback despite the turnovers. Impressive.

This Packers passing offense is truly ugly. No rhythm. I see some clever misdirection concepts, but it's not enough against this feisty Miami defense. Receivers are having issues separating from defenders. It's a good thing they'll likely miss the playoffs. But real improvement is a good ways away unless they splurge in free agency.

**Why can I not remember that when bad teams are favored on the road, always pick the home team? Look at the Rams clobbering Denver despite being 3-point underdogs.**

I think the Lions were caught slacking. To cough up that many yards to the Panthers is unthinkable. Even if their most physical safety was out of the game, it doesn't matter - watching the game, I saw Detroit regularly stationing 7 people in the box. It didn't seem to matter at all. It's possible these Lions were coming off a high after winning last week's closely contested game against another playoff contender. Carolina was on the opposite end of that spectrum after coming off their worst rushing game last week against the Steelers.

Justin Fields clearly isn't in mid-season form. Rushing the ball only seven times against a Buffalo defense known for giving up yards on the ground is worrisome. I had a feeling the Bills would play down below their pay grade after coming off a statement win against the Dolphins, but without Fields being able to run amuck, Chicago's throwing nothing but 11 corpses out there on offense.
