## Chargers @ Chiefs

Now that Keenan Allen is on the mend, it's pretty clear Herbert is relying on Josh Palmer to take on the role as the short-yardage option.

Chiefs are still insisting on playing press man coverage, even against Mike Williams. Very risky.

Chargers pass coverage is not as conservative now that Tyreek Hill is no longer dressed in a Chiefs uniform. Surprised to see Los Angeles gamble with jailbreak blitzes. There was a time not so long ago teams would be afraid to throw any more than four pass rushers against Mahomes. Maybe that's not the case now that the Chiefs lost some of their explosiveness by trading away Hill to Miami.

Mike Williams is something special, isn't he? A great one-handed catch with Les Sneed draped all over him in tight coverage.  More importantly, it seems the Chiefs are still insisting on trusting their defensive backs in lone coverage against Williams, even though Williams has been the one Charger weapon killing them on scoring drives.

Impressively enough, the Chargers were able to pull off a goal-line stand against the Chiefs offense, preventing the Chiefs from punching the ball into the end zone on three consecutive downs. The last attempt was a shovel pass to Kelce that was blown up right away.

Lack of conditioning is really starting to show for these Chargers. Gerald Everett getting winded led to Herbert throwing an inadvertent pick-six to the Kansas defense.

The pressure has rattled Herbert. Chris Jones and the Chiefs with their blitz packages have managed to shake him up.

Herbert throwing an absolute dime despite the internal bleeding. The man has heart.

## Panthers @ Giants

Daniel Jones isn't looking too comfortable in this Daboll offense. Hopefully, things change as they did for Josh Allen, but such shifts usually take months.

Daniel Jones stat line the first quarter and a half have been pathetic. No deep passes.

How is Richie James the best receiver on offense? James is a cast-off from the 49ers too. Just...odd. Where's Sterling Shepard? Kenny Golladay? Darius Slayton?

Both offenses came out with touchdowns on their opening drives in the second half. Seems to me that some of their plays may have been scripted (like the hard play action from Baker or the beautifully orchestrated half bootleg from Daniel Jones).

It's confirmed. Now both teams have resorted back to rushing plays and their usual staples to move the ball.

Giants loves running the ball between the tackles in zone fashion. Unfortunately, it doesn't work well against teams with stout fronts. I wish New York would opt to run outside the tackles.

Keep in mind the Giants defensive personnel are playing out there without Azeez Ojulari and Kayvon Thibadeaux. Leonard Williams has also been absent for the second half due to a knee injury.

## Jets @ Browns

Chubb still a tour de force for Cleveland.

Cleveland's prevent defense is among the worst in the league. Flacco is having a ball just making hay against their prevent defense.

***

## Commanders @ Lions

D'Andre Swift and the Lions ground game may be one of the surprise stories of the season.

Ben Johnson seems to have incorporated quite a few crossing routes in the playbook, to Jared Goff's benefit. Goff loves throwing those crossers.

Hard for me to say this....but Detroit may actually be a good team.

***

## Dolphins @ Ravens

Greg Roman incorporating wishbone formations and pre-snap motion into his running packages. Impressive.

Rashod Bateman finally stepping up as a deep threat for the Ravens. Very much needed too, considering their lack of weaponry.

Justin Houston might be a resurgent force here for the Ravens pass rush.

Baltimore let up 21 points in the last quarter, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Just....wow.

***

## Buccaneers @ Saints

I suspect Jameis may be predetermining some of his throws.

Jameis playing with fractures in his back. I wish I knew this before taking the Saints in the contest. I would have gone with the Jets or Texans then. He was present on the injury report with back issues, but who the hell suspected it'd be something as serious as fractures?!

Brady has been absolutely stymied save for one solid drive in the second half. Disappointing to see the Saints losing despite such a sensational performance from their defense.

I think Devin White is cementing himself again as an elite pass rusher. Should Shaq Barrett also return to elite form or Vita Vea finally break out as a pass rusher, Tampa Bay will be complete in defense.

## Bengals @ Cowboys

Are the Cowboys playing more cover two against Cincinnati now that Pittsburgh experienced so much success playing that style of football against them? If so, kudos to Dan Quinn for adjusting.

Yes, I think Cowboys are playing quite a bit of two-safety coverage against Joe Burrow and company. This is not going to be an easy game to win for Burrow. Quinn has proven himself capable of adapting his plan according to opponent.

Cincinnati's blocking and protection schemes may be the worst in the league. Kudos to Dan Quinn for recognizing that and attacking the Bengals front accordingly.

Ezekiel Elliott is very effective running outside the line.

Good use of the hurry-up offense to change up pace.

1st and 5 begging for play-action and Zac Taylor opts to run the ball instead. Asswipe.

***

## Seahawks @ 49ers

Well, Trey Lance getting his ankle broken doesn't help Seattle much, does it? You'd rather have Trey Lance in there than Jimmy Garoppalo. Now Kyle Shanahan is free to run the style of offense he prefers.

A trick play out of the wishbone was just so poorly executed by Seattle. Ended in the easiest interception I've seen in a long time.

Poor tackling by the Seahawks.

***

## Cardinals @ Raiders

Kliff Kingsbury and Kyler Murray are trying to stage a comeback here and are yards away from tying up the game at the end. It's clear as day Murray's looking to throw the ball short to a receiver just as one breaks the plane. Somehow, the Raiders are not doing that. The Raiders are content playing a preventative style of defense and dropping men deep in the end zone.

No signs of aggression too. Patrick Graham is all too happy just sending four men after Murray, even though it's clearly not working.

Kliff incorporating option runs now. Interesting. I don't remember seeing this before.

Once again, the difference maker here has been Kyler Murray's speed. It's bailed them out on two critical 4th downs. It's something that can't be sustained, as we've seen time and time again.

Watching this Raiders offense...Arizona is the more physical team, full stop.

Why is Mack Hollins more a focal point of this offense rather than Davante Adams or Hunter Renfrow? Something's not right here.

Maxx Crosby is the sole reason why Arizona's first couple drives stalled.

The Raiders and their linebackers are just terrible overall. I mean...truly terrible. In fact, this whole Raiders defense behind the line seems a little slow.

Cardinals playing quite a bit of nickel cover-two on defense, occasionally mixing things up with a five man front and man coverage.

Greg Dortsch is the top receiver for the Cardinals now that Rondale Moore and DeAndre Hopkins are not active. It was only by having him participate that the Cardinals were able to score on offense.

I think Kliff just straight outwitted Patrick Graham by incorporating concepts centered around running the quarterback. Even though it's a concept that ultimately compromises Kyler later down the season, it pays massive dividends in early games like this.

Judging by this game alone, I'm wagering that the Raiders will have one of the NFL's worst run defenses when everything is said and done this season. Not good.

Chandler Jones has yet to make any serious impact on defense, at least in this game. On the other hand, Zack Allen for the Cardinals has really stepped up at rushing the passer, at least in the second half.

I have to admit - this Raiders offense is uninspiring. Power runs, bland routes...the pre-snap motion from Davante Adams is nice though.

***

## Bears @ Packers

Creative series of scripted plays to give the Bears the early lead. Well done, Luke Getsy.

LaFleur needs to be given credit, if only for his ability to script an effective ground game and his willingness to experiment with two tailbacks in the backfield.

***

## Dolphins @ Ravens

Tua can throw deep. Never underestimate Tua's arm, as the Ravens so cavalierly did. Man coverage against Tyreek Hill is incredibly ill-advised.

Lamar still has issues, but he can still make magic with his legs.

Poor planning from Mike Macdonald, not keeping Tyreek Hill bracketed at all times. Now was the opportunity to do so as well, given all the injuries in the secondary. Yet Macdonald still chanced things with man coverage against a speed demon like Tyreek.
