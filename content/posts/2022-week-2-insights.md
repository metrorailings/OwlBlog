## Chargers @ Chiefs

Now that Keenan Allen is on the mend, it's pretty clear Herbert is relying on Josh Palmer to take on the role as the short-yardage option.

Chiefs are still insisting on playing press man coverage, even against Mike Williams. Very risky.

Chargers pass coverage is not as conservative now that Tyreek Hill is no longer dressed in a Chiefs uniform. Surprised to see Los Angeles gamble with jailbreak blitzes. There was a time not so long ago teams would be afraid to throw any more than four pass rushers against Mahomes. Maybe that's not the case now that the Chiefs lost some of their explosiveness by trading away Hill to Miami.

Mike Williams is something special, isn't he? A great one-handed catch with Les Sneed draped all over him in tight coverage.  More importantly, it seems the Chiefs are still insisting on trusting their defensive backs in lone coverage against Williams, even though Williams has been the one Charger weapon killing them on scoring drives.

Impressively enough, the Chargers were able to pull off a goal-line stand against the Chiefs offense, preventing the Chiefs from punching the ball into the end zone on three consecutive downs. The last attempt was a shovel pass to Kelce that was blown up right away.

Lack of conditioning is really starting to show for these Chargers. Gerald Everett getting winded led to Herbert throwing an inadvertent pick-six to the Kansas defense.

The pressure has rattled Herbert. Chris Jones and the Chiefs with their blitz packages have managed to shake him up.

Herbert throwing an absolute dime despite the internal bleeding. The man has heart.

## Panthers @ Giants

Daniel Jones isn't looking too comfortable in this Daboll offense. Hopefully, things change as they did for Josh Allen, but such shifts usually take months.

***

## Jets @ Browns

Chubb still a tour de force for Cleveland.

***

## Commanders @ Lions

D'Andre Swift and the Lions ground game may be one of the surprise stories of the season.

***

## Dolphins @ Ravens

Greg Roman incorporating wishbone formations and pre-snap motion into his running packages. Impressive.
