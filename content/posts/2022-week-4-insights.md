## Dolphins @ Bengals

Dolphins have issues defensing the run.

Good adjustment by Boyer, switching over to a two-safety look to keep the Bengals from cashing in on their signature big plays.

Holland is a significant player on Miami's defense.

Boyer seems to have abandoned the double-high safety looks in favor of man coverage. Either that or he only opts to employ that style of coverage on third downs. Either way, Burrow finally made some money on those signature deep plays.

Miami can't manufacture any pressure on Burrow. Very disappointing considering these same Dolphins were considered one of the league's best when it came to rushing the passer last year.

Interesting that both of Miami's starting cornerbacks are out and Boyer still insists on running man coverage, especially against a Bengal team that's been notably weak against zone coverage.

I feel like Cincinnati's offense should be more productive given the style of defense Miami prefers to play and the lack of pressure. But only 13 completions on 22 throws made from a clean pocket? Not good.

Hayden Hurst finally involved in the Cincinnati passing game.
