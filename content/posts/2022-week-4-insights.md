## Dolphins @ Bengals

Dolphins have issues defensing the run.

Good adjustment by Boyer, switching over to a two-safety look to keep the Bengals from cashing in on their signature big plays.

Holland is a significant player on Miami's defense.

Boyer seems to have abandoned the double-high safety looks. Either that or he only opts to employ that style of coverage on third downs. Either way, Burrow finally made some money on those signature deep plays.

Miami can't manufacture any pressure on Burrow. Very disappointing considering these same Dolphins were considered one of the league's best when it came to rushing the passer last year.
