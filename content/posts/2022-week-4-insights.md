## Dolphins @ Bengals

Dolphins have issues defensing the run.

Good adjustment by Boyer, switching over to a two-safety look to keep the Bengals from cashing in on their signature big plays.

Holland is a significant player on Miami's defense.

Boyer seems to have abandoned the double-high safety looks in favor of man coverage. Either that or he only opts to employ that style of coverage on third downs. Either way, Burrow finally made some money on those signature deep plays.

Miami can't manufacture any pressure on Burrow. Very disappointing considering these same Dolphins were considered one of the league's best when it came to rushing the passer last year.

Interesting that both of Miami's starting cornerbacks are out and Boyer still insists on running man coverage, especially against a Bengal team that's been notably weak against zone coverage.

I feel like Cincinnati's offense should be more productive given the style of defense Miami prefers to play and the lack of pressure. But only 13 completions on 22 throws made from a clean pocket? Not good.

Hayden Hurst finally involved in the Cincinnati passing game.

## Commanders @ Cowboys

The Commanders defensive line is truly something fierce. Nobody else this season has been able to force more negative plays from the Cowboys than Washington.

***

## Chargers @ Texans

Fuck Pep Hamilton. The fact that this offense couldn't score as many points against the Chargers as they did last year is an indictment on his style of offense. Dameon Pierce has only 13 carries! 13 carries?! Last year, Houston gave their tailbacks 35 chances with the rock against these Chargers.

## Patriots @ Packers

Packers were successful throwing the ball against the Patriots early zone coverage, but ever since New England switched to man coverage, the ground game has taken over.

Aaron Rodgers missing on some receivers who've had a step on their man defender. Not good.

Patriots switching from an inside zone running scheme to a power running scheme in the second half. It's been paying off tremendously.

## Cardinals @ Panthers

Still not sure what to make of this Panther defense. Brian Burns is a star as is Jeremy Chinn. Does anybody else really stand out? What about their first-round draft picks in the secondary?

Once again, Phil Snow with his hopeless three-man rushes.

Frankie Luvu may be another name worth watching on that Carolina defense. He's been making multiple impact plays in the game.

## Seahawks @ Lions

Geno Smith's ability to run is something I've never really appreciated until now.

Seattle incorporating quite a bit of bootlegs and five-wide formations now on offense. Impressive. I'm seeing something coalescing here.

Geno Smith is _very_ comfortable in this system.

Both these defenses like to employ the zone blitz and occasionally drop linemen into coverage.

## Chiefs @ Buccaneers

Now the Chiefs offense is demonstrating a willingness to pass it short, something that should have been back in the Super Bowl. It's paying off against the conservative defensive scheme Bowles is employing against the Kansas offense.

Shaq Barrett and Devin White are Tampa's best pass rushers, hands down.

Tom Brady is losing a step. First, it was the match against the Packers where he came in wearing a shirt of his younger self. Then it was him insisting on passing the ball with depth receivers against a defense that prioritizes its passing defense. Now it's him being unable to see a blitz that led to a complete shift in momentum.

Carlton Davis is pointless. Just letting up major completions.

So it's the second half of the game and Tampa Bay has completely given up on running the ball. Only 3 rushes to something like 30 passes. This is a worrying trend.

This Kansas offense execution has been damn near masterful. Despite the painful loss last week and the hurricane, it's clear the Chiefs came here with the emotional edge. That Super Bowl loss still hurts to this day.
