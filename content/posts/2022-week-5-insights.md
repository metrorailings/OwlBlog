## Colts @ Broncos

Interesting match between these two deadbeats.

As expected, uneventful. No touchdowns. Sums up the ineptitude of both offenses.

Baron Browning may be a top-tier pass rusher for this team. All the more remarkable considering this team is loaded with pass rushing talent (Bradley Chubb, Randy Gregory, and Josey Jewell whenever he blitzes from his linebacking position)

Russell Wilson is washed up. This game all but confirms it. He's missing rapport with his receivers and he lacks touch on his throws.

The Colts love to play quite a bit of cover-three under Gus Bradley. Their rush defense needs to be watched over the next several weeks, as cover-three defenses tend to excel against opposing rushers.

Meaning, Ejiro Evero has proven without any doubt he's a student of the Fangio style defense. He loves fielding five-man fronts with a lone linebacker behind them. These types of defenses are usually susceptible against power rushers, as the Raiders so aptly demonstrated last week.

## Lions @ Patriots

This Patriot team having little issue running the ball against this soft Detroit defense.

***

## Chargers @ Browns

Odd to see Justin Herbert's stat line so poor starting out the game. Maybe Joe Woods is turning a corner?

Austin Ekeler has turned a new leaf this season. Granted, the Browns suck on defense, but it's been two weeks of Ekeler looking impressive.

## Bears @ Vikings

Against poor defenses, Kirk Cousins thrives.

***

## Steelers @ Bills

Is Josh Allen really elite? I'm seeing some poor throws from him here.

***

## Texans @ Jaguars

I don't think Trevor Lawrence can really operate as a drop-back passer...

Lawrence with a horrible decision leading to a red zone interception. I can't quite emphasize how bad of a decision this was too. Jaguars are outplaying the Texans, but these careless mistakes are really dooming them.

Folo Fatukasi being out for the Jaguars is seriously hurting their rushing defense. I was hoping it wouldn't matter so long as Jacksonville can run up the score, but they just can't.

Trevor Lawrence still plays too much like a bum for my liking.  As does Marvin Jones.

## Seahawks @ Saints

Seattle's special-teams with a very questionable turnover. What the hell are they thinking?

Seattle's defense seems helpless against the quarterback option run.

So possible the worst defense in the league traveling on the road a second time, it shouldn't be surprising to see the Saints produce some offense here. What surprises me is how sloppy Seattle has been played. I mean...it's been embarrassingly sloppy.

Taysom Hill was damn near unstoppable. Apparently, the man alone makes all the difference in the world, more than Geno Smith playing at a higher level. The Seahawks were helpless to stop him.

## Cowboys @ Rams

Not sure why Kellen Moore is opting to spread the receivers out and pass the ball exclusively, especially when the Rams have shown themselves susceptible to power runs.

Odd that the Cowboys are playing man coverage against Cooper Kupp knowing he's the only weapon the Rams have.

Trayvon Diggs is a bum.

Kudos to Kellen Moore for devoting valuable snaps to the ground game, knowing the Rams are vulnerable to that.

Aaron Donald lining up over the left tackle has been hurting Dallas. A great pass rusher going up against this rookie left tackle can really frustrate drives.

One thing I like about the Rams is their special teams. Just smart plays overall - faking fair catches to ensure the ball rolls into the end zone, well-executed fake punts...
