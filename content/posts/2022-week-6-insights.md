## Ravens @ Giants

Seems weird seeing Wink leave the middle of the field so undermanned on third downs, knowing Lamar loves throwing down the middle.

Giants doing well containing the more exotic rushes, as expected considering Wink's been training against Lamar for the past several years.

Are you really putting Mark Andrews in single man coverage?
