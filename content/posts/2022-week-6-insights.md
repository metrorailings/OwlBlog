## Ravens @ Giants

Seems weird seeing Wink leave the middle of the field so undermanned on third downs, knowing Lamar loves throwing down the middle.

Giants doing well containing the more exotic rushes, as expected considering Wink's been training against Lamar for the past several years.

Are you really putting Mark Andrews in single man coverage? Then again, not sure if it matters much - his ability to find holes in middle coverage is pretty impressive.

I'm really impressed at the general athleticism of this Raven defense.

Daniel Jones just a touch off on his throws, but still playing fairly well. Lamar too. 

Kenyon Drake has been a sensational rusher for Baltimore. Worth keeping an eye on him.

Not many negative plays from the Giants defense. A couple negative-runs, only 1 sack, few penalties holding back the Ravens....Baltimore's sustaining long drives here.

## Patriots @ Browns

Cleveland giving up a rushing touchdown on 3rd and 10 is just hilarious. 

Cleveland's defense is just being outplayed by the Bailey Zappe-led Patriots. Not much pressure on Zappe, defensive personnel forgetting to pick people up in coverage, cornerbacks whiffing on press...

## Jets @ Packers

Reminder to watch this game to see how the Jets kept the Packers from scoring early like they normally do.
