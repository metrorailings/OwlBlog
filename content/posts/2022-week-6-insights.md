## Ravens @ Giants

Seems weird seeing Wink leave the middle of the field so undermanned on third downs, knowing Lamar loves throwing down the middle.

Giants doing well containing the more exotic rushes, as expected considering Wink's been training against Lamar for the past several years.

Are you really putting Mark Andrews in single man coverage? Then again, not sure if it matters much - his ability to find holes in middle coverage is pretty impressive.

I'm really impressed at the general athleticism of this Raven defense.

Daniel Jones just a touch off on his throws, but still playing fairly well. Lamar too. 

Kenyon Drake has been a sensational rusher for Baltimore. Worth keeping an eye on him.

Not many negative plays from the Giants defense. A couple negative-runs, only 1 sack, few penalties holding back the Ravens....Baltimore's sustaining long drives here.

## Patriots @ Browns

Cleveland giving up a rushing touchdown on 3rd and 10 is just hilarious. 

Cleveland's defense is just being outplayed by the Bailey Zappe-led Patriots. Not much pressure on Zappe, defensive personnel forgetting to pick people up in coverage, cornerbacks whiffing on press...

## Jets @ Packers

Reminder to watch this game to see how the Jets kept the Packers from scoring early like they normally do.

## Bills @ Chiefs

Ken Dorsey impressing me with his scripted plays. He's moving Stefon Diggs around to optimize match-ups.

Nice to see Kansas finally commit hard to the short game. 13 of their first 15 touchdowns have been from goal-to-go situations.

Spagnuolo starting to frustrate Josh Allen with well-designed blitzes. 

Pacheco is a hard runner.

For the Bills, Devin Singletary seems more and more a liability. Not much football IQ nor much willingness to make the tough catches.

Once again, brilliant end-of-half play-calling from Andy Reid helped Kansas post another 3 points to close out the first half.

Finally, Josh Allen punishes the Chiefs for their blitzing.

## Cardinals @ Seahawks

Cardinals are now running the ball more with Murray and Conner.

Smart zone-rush by the Seahawks to force a Cardinal punt.

The Seahawks cannot handle these blitzes from the Cardinals. Their play-action game is nerfed if the Cardinals already break through the line of scrimmage at the snap. On top of that, their passing game is nerfed too. I'm honestly wondering how much of Seattle's playbook is dedicated towards shorter passes and pseudo-rushing plays. I imagine not that much.

Walker is a helluva player for the Seahawks, breaking a bunch of tackles.

I think Kyler's struggling to communicate with his men in such a hostile environment.

Surprised to see Seattle stack up so many sacks in this game. I suppose Pete Carroll has keyed in a bit on Arizona's protection scheme.
