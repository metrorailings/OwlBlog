## Ravens @ Giants

Seems weird seeing Wink leave the middle of the field so undermanned on third downs, knowing Lamar loves throwing down the middle.

Giants doing well containing the more exotic rushes, as expected considering Wink's been training against Lamar for the past several years.

Are you really putting Mark Andrews in single man coverage? Then again, not sure if it matters much - his ability to find holes in middle coverage is pretty impressive.

I'm really impressed at the general athleticism of this Raven defense.

Daniel Jones just a touch off on his throws, but still playing fairly well. Lamar too. 

Kenyon Drake has been a sensational rusher for Baltimore. Worth keeping an eye on him.

Not many negative plays from the Giants defense. A couple negative-runs, only 1 sack, few penalties holding back the Ravens....Baltimore's sustaining long drives here.

## Patriots @ Browns

Cleveland giving up a rushing touchdown on 3rd and 10 is just hilarious. 

Cleveland's defense is just being outplayed by the Bailey Zappe-led Patriots. Not much pressure on Zappe, defensive personnel forgetting to pick people up in coverage, cornerbacks whiffing on press...

One thing I like about the Patriots - they're not stressing their young quarterback too much. In negative game script, they're giving him easy plays to execute.

Patriots surprising me with how well they're containing Chubb and Hunt. Judon, Deatrich Wise, and safety Kyle Duggar are all making plays against them.

Bailey Zappe showing some impressive processing ability, given that he's been pretty quick exploiting gaps in coverage wherever he can find them.

Cleveland cannot be a pass-first team, end of story. At least not until Watson returns.

Nobody on Cleveland's defense is impressing. Cornerbacks are losing in man coverage, nobody on the defensive line can mount any pressure, linebackers are useless...

Deatrich Wise impressing me lately, making an impact on a number of plays.

## Jets @ Packers

Reminder to watch this game to see how the Jets kept the Packers from scoring early like they normally do.

The Jets defensive line absolutely dominated this Packer offensive front. I mean...plays are frequently being made in the backfield from their linemen. Pretty crazy. Rodgers' interior linemen can't hold up against Quinnen Williams and company.

CJ Mosley is a game-changer.

Amazing. The Packers are being given every opportunity to seize the game and not look back. But the Jets defense has been playing amazing.

Zack Wilson hasn't been playing well. Failing to read the blitz, lacking pocket presence...these are the intangibles you need to succeed in the NFL.

Jets seem to be sticking to single high-coverage, though I see some cover-two in there as well. Usually, when they have two safeties stationed deep, the defensive backs underneath are in man coverage.

Rodgers hand isn't right.

Jets have some admirable misdirection baked into their offense.

The tackle-tackle twist has been absolutely devastating against Green Bay. Apparently, the offensive line is doing nothing to adjust for that.

Special teams has been especially bad for these Packers. Just sad execution and coordination leading to a blocked field goal and a blocked punt returned for a touchdown.

Green Bay has serious issues defensing crafty runners. Pass coverage is pretty good, but rushing defense is worrisome.

## Bills @ Chiefs

Ken Dorsey impressing me with his scripted plays. He's moving Stefon Diggs around to optimize match-ups.

Nice to see Kansas finally commit hard to the short game. 13 of their first 15 touchdowns have been from goal-to-go situations.

Spagnuolo starting to frustrate Josh Allen with well-designed blitzes. 

Pacheco is a hard runner.

For the Bills, Devin Singletary seems more and more a liability. Not much football IQ nor much willingness to make the tough catches.

Once again, brilliant end-of-half play-calling from Andy Reid helped Kansas post another 3 points to close out the first half.

Finally, Josh Allen punishes the Chiefs for their blitzing. 

If this wasn't already known, Von Miller is an elite pass rusher.

## Cardinals @ Seahawks

Cardinals are now running the ball more with Murray and Conner.

Smart zone-rush by the Seahawks to force a Cardinal punt.

The Seahawks cannot handle these blitzes from the Cardinals. Their play-action game is nerfed if the Cardinals already break through the line of scrimmage at the snap. On top of that, their passing game is nerfed too. I'm honestly wondering how much of Seattle's playbook is dedicated towards shorter passes and pseudo-rushing plays. I imagine not that much.

Walker is a helluva player for the Seahawks, breaking a bunch of tackles.

I think Kyler's struggling to communicate with his men in such a hostile environment.

Surprised to see Seattle stack up so many sacks in this game. I suppose Pete Carroll has keyed in a bit on Arizona's protection scheme.

***

## Cowboys @ Eagles

Eagles running the ball effectively in zone all over these Cowboys. Only Micah Parsons has been the only player to hold himself well.

Kellen Moore not calling a quarterback sneak on fourth and inches?

Mike McCarthy may be one of the worst head coaches in the league at discipline and challenges.

Cooper Rush looks terrible. Without the running game, he starts turning into mush.

This read-option game on Micah Parsons has been devastating.

It's clear Philadelphia had the emotional edge here. Just looking at the coaches, the fans, the way the cornerbacks are playing.

## 49ers @ Falcons

Credit to Grady Jarrett and Dean Pees using 8-man coverage to stop the 49ers on their opening drive.

Grady Jarrett and the rest of Atlanta's interior defensive linemen are something special.

49ers loading the box against these Falcons.

Talan Hufonga involved on quite a few blitzes for these 49ers. He may be an impact player though...
