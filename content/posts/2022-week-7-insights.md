## Giants @ Jaguars

This Wan'Dale Robinson guy has some potential for the Giants.

Josh Allen naturally a difference maker for Jacksonville.

Smart coaching from the Jaguars offensive staff, taking advantage of the Giants and their blitzing tendencies.

Injuries are taking a toll on the Giants. Both their starting guards are out, and Wan'Dale Robinson is dealing with some issues himself. 

Panthers using hurry-up to their advantage, knowing the Giants aren't used to the stifling humidity.

Both offenses are overperforming today. I imagine it's because they're both very familiar with this Baltimore-defense - Mike Caldwell and Wink Martindale were once colleagues in Baltimore. Jacksonville's play selection seems to indicate this too, given the number of screens and lateral plays they made.

Daniel Jones once again impressing me, though his accuracy could use a bit more work.

## Buccaneers @ Panthers

No Brady sneak on 3rd and 1 and 4th and 1? Yikes. Father Time might finally be winning here.

All of a sudden, Carolina has found a sort of groove offensively with Chuba Hubbard, DJ Moore, and Foreman.

Brady is losing his touch.

Remember the cardinal rule - teams who were beaten soundly only to return home as double-digit underdogs against mediocre teams....do not bet against them.

## Seahawks @ Chargers

Marquise Goodwin may be yet another additional weapon for the Seahawks, though it helps when Geno Smith's making beautiful passes to him.

## Chiefs @ 49ers

Nick Bosa making the same careless offsides error two downs in a row. May be a sign of this team's lack of commitment to details. DeMeco Ryan is supposed to be one of the best defensive minds in this league too.

It's long overdue, but Brandon Aiyuk is making a case for himself here as a reliable vector on offense.

I wonder if Kansas can sustain a pass rush if Chris Jones is ever sidelined.

Kansas and their jet sweeps are damn near perfectly executed. Kudos to Andy Reid.

Nick Bosa starting to lose credibility.
