## Giants @ Jaguars

This Wan'Dale Robinson guy has some potential for the Giants.

Josh Allen naturally a difference maker for Jacksonville.

Smart coaching from the Jaguars offensive staff, taking advantage of the Giants and their blitzing tendencies.

Injuries are taking a toll on the Giants. Both their starting guards are out, and Wan'Dale Robinson is dealing with some issues himself. 

Panthers using hurry-up to their advantage, knowing the Giants aren't used to the stifling humidity.

Both offenses are overperforming today. I imagine it's because they're both very familiar with this Baltimore-defense - Mike Caldwell and Wink Martindale were once colleagues in Baltimore. Jacksonville's play selection seems to indicate this too, given the number of screens and lateral plays they made.

Daniel Jones once again impressing me, though his accuracy could use a bit more work.
