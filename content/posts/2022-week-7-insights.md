## Giants @ Jaguars

This Wan'Dale Robinson guy has some potential for the Giants.

Josh Allen naturally a difference maker for Jacksonville.

Smart coaching from the Jaguars offensive staff, taking advantage of the Giants and their blitzing tendencies.

Injuries are taking a toll on the Giants. Both their starting guards are out, and Wan'Dale Robinson is dealing with some issues himself.

Panthers using hurry-up to their advantage, knowing the Giants aren't used to the stifling humidity.

Both offenses are overperforming today. I imagine it's because they're both very familiar with this Baltimore-defense - Mike Caldwell and Wink Martindale were once colleagues in Baltimore. Jacksonville's play selection seems to indicate this too, given the number of screens and lateral plays they made.

Daniel Jones once again impressing me, though his accuracy could use a bit more work.

## Buccaneers @ Panthers

No Brady sneak on 3rd and 1 and 4th and 1? Yikes. Father Time might finally be winning here.

All of a sudden, Carolina has found a sort of groove offensively with Chuba Hubbard, DJ Moore, and Foreman.

Brady is losing his touch.

Remember the cardinal rule - teams who were beaten soundly only to return home as double-digit underdogs against mediocre teams....do not bet against them.

## Seahawks @ Chargers

Marquise Goodwin may be yet another additional weapon for the Seahawks, though it helps when Geno Smith's making beautiful passes to him.

Geno frustrates me. Every now and then, his throws are bafflingly off. I suppose you could blame miscommunication sometimes, but that excuse can only be used once or twice.

## Chiefs @ 49ers

Nick Bosa making the same careless offsides error two downs in a row. May be a sign of this team's lack of commitment to details. DeMeco Ryan is supposed to be one of the best defensive minds in this league too.

It's long overdue, but Brandon Aiyuk is making a case for himself here as a reliable vector on offense.

I wonder if Kansas can sustain a pass rush if Chris Jones is ever sidelined.

Kansas and their jet sweeps are damn near perfectly executed. Kudos to Andy Reid.

Nick Bosa starting to lose credibility. Two offside penalties in a row, looking lost on jet sweeps, falling for linemen chopping down at his legs...

So many procedural penalties on the 49ers IN THEIR HOME FIELD.

I'm thinking these 49ers don't have any pass rush without Nick Bosa and Arik Armstead. And Bosa hasn't been playing well and Armstead's been an injury case.

Dave Toub with the smart play, forcing a false start to take the 49ers out of field-goal range.

49ers with ineffective man coverage. Twice on 3rd and long have these Chiefs covered.

## Texans @ Raiders

I need to spend a bit more time studying this game. Find out if Derek Carr is better improvising or operating under this McDaniels system.

Vegas might have found an identity. Texans defense was absolutely helpless in the second half.

The Texans simply cannot contain runs to the outside. Fascinating. Their linebackers are so slow. How did the Jaguars lose to these chumps again?

## Packers @ Washington

Heinecke definitely infuses this offense with spirit given his gunslinger mentality and his innate toughness. It helps that he's playing home too.

Not only does Rodgers not trust his receivers, but he does not trust his linemen. To be fair, his receivers haven't been doing him much favor, especially with Lazard out.
