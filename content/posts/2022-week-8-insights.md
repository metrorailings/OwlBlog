## Patriots @ Jets

So this might be the end of Mac Jones.

The Jets defense needs to be given serious credit here for being so stout despite the Patriots dominating time of possession.

The Patriots are getting bailed out by the referees. A shame too. A roughing the passer call that wiped out a pick-six. Earlier, another unnecessary roughness call against a mobile Mac Jones gave the Patriots some unnecessary life on a drive.

I have to give credit to New England, adjusting in the second half offensively by committing to shorter, quicker passes. Less stress also put on Mac Jones shoulders, considering he doesn't have to wait for routes to develop.

Meanwhile, the Jets seem to have trusted Zack Wilson to carry the team here. BIG mistake. Wilson's so bad that he threw an interception on a throwaway.

As I thought, this was a game dictated by mistakes and sloppy moments. Good thing I stayed away from this one. Both starting quarterbacks have been just depressing.

## Cardinals @ Vikings

I think the rigors of the season are finally taking their toll on Kyler. He took two rough hits at the end. Good opportunity to bet against him and this team going forward.

JJ Watt may be the best defensive lineman for the Cardinals. Pretty surprising.

***

## Raiders @ Saints

The Saints are mustering pressure despite the Raiders chipping and dropping extra protectors back. Interesting.

I think the Raiders also advertised their fake punt by stacking protectors along one side of the formation.

Derek Carr sucks. Way too dependent on the receivers he deems trustworthy.

So this team is a run-first team. Vegas needs to desperately establish the run to develop rhythm on offense.

Vegas is getting manhandled at the line of scrimmage. As simple as that. No member of their offensive line is holding up in protection. The bookends especially have a hard time controlling the edge and limiting the edge rushers.

## 49ers @ Rams

Two fades at the goal-line? Really, Rams? No jet sweeps, no shovel passes?

This Rams running game is pathetic. Absolutely incapable of gaining goal-to-go yardage against the 49ers.

Never doubt the inferiority complex again. It's a real thing. The Rams actually played well in the first half, but completely collapsed in the second.

***

## Giants @ Seahawks

Giants actually impressing against the run here. Good to see them getting better over time.

Shane Waldron and his unit are executing some really creative plays on critical downs.

Excellent touchdown play by the Seahawks, using underneath crossers to create space for DK Metcalf.

Adoree Jackson playing very well for the Giants secondary.

Giants put up a fight, but turnovers and an inability to move the ball against a surprisingly stingy Seattle defense effectively doomed them.

Seahawks are a name to watch in the postseason. It just depends on whether they can develop a pass rusher or two.

***

## Packers @ Bills

Bills defense playing incredibly physical. Not afraid to throw their weight around.

Josh Allen making some silly mistakes late in the game, likely out of carelessness given his team has such a strong lead.

Buffalo as big favorites against a proud team isn't ideal. That being said, the opportunity was there for the cover. But as I expected, the Packers were scrappy enough (especially over ground) and managed to score just enough to make this interesting.

Aaron Rodgers is taking waaaaay too much time educating his skill players on the 2-minute offense. Interesting.

***

## Panthers @ Falcons

Neither of these two teams can defense against the run.

Derrick Brown and Brian Burns working well together to stop one Falcons drive.

Lorenzo Carter with a sensational pick six by anticipating the screen throw.

Thoroughly unimpressed with Atlanta's defense. Just slow, especially in the back end. The Falcons need to invest more money on this side of the ball. And it's possible Dean Pees may need to finally retire for good.

Cornell Armstrong showing up big in single coverage, albeit against a depth defensive back.

PJ Walker really likes his sideline throws.

***

## Bengals @ Browns

Jacoby Brissett is average at best. Foolish decisions, bad throws, etc. But he does have some innate toughness to him.

The inferiority complex is real here. Never doubt it.
