## Dolphins @ Bears

I need to watch this game. The Bears have been surprisingly productive on offense over the past three weeks. Credit to them.

I swear, these receivers are coming back upfield to catch Tua's passes. He doesn't have much strength in his passes, does he?

Bears covered the spread as home underdogs after coming off a bad loss.

## Panthers @ Bengals

These Panthers have been absolutely unable to stop the Bengals on offense. It's a shame. Joe Mixon seems to be running rabid all over Carolina. I need to watch this tape. Maybe Lombardi had a point that last-second losses linger.

Joe Mixon had a historic day, tallying up four touchdowns.

## Raiders @ Jaguars

Meanwhile, the Raiders are dominating this match. It makes me wonder if it helps that they spent time on the East Coast this week bonding with one another.

It's worth noting conditions are pretty humid, although cloudy.

## Chargers @ Falcons

Lots of experimentation on Atlanta's side, putting Mariota out there in empty personnel.

I lost some respect for Arthur Smith. I think he forced Mariota to make too many passes, despite the running game working just swimmingly. And after I saw Khalil Mack literally just take the ball away from Drake London, I'm convinced the Falcons don't have much idea how to win. Even their win against Carolina last week came miraculously off a missed extra point and a missed field goal in overtime.

It's a push, but the Falcons had opportunities to put this game away. Drake London getting mugged like a child at the goal line and Younghoe Koo missing a field goal despite his high standards....it's worrying. Atlanta doesn't have that winner's spirit. I can't be betting on teams that lack the winning spirit unless they're taking at least 4 points.

## Bills @ Jets

Jets covered as a massive home underdog after losing outright last week. But they just won straight up. Impressive. The Jets know how to win.
