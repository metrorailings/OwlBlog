## Dolphins @ Bears

I need to watch this game. The Bears have been surprisingly productive on offense over the past three weeks. Credit to them.

## Panthers @ Bengals

These Panthers have been absolutely unable to stop the Bengals on offense. It's a shame. Joe Mixon seems to be running rabid all over Carolina. I need to watch this tape. Maybe Lombardi had a point that last-second losses linger.

## Raiders @ Jaguars

Meanwhile, the Raiders are dominating this match. It makes me wonder if it helps that they spent time on the East Coast this week bonding with one another.
