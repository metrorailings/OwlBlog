Purdy started out a bit shaky (perhaps due to playoff jitters), but was able to play better ball in the second half. Once Purdy settled down and the 49ers were able to build a comfortable lead, the game was effectively. Seattle really doesn't have a history this year of mounting comebacks, so it's hard to imagine them doing just that against one of the best defenses in the league.The game went (more or less) as predicted. Seattle did surprise me with some creative plays in the first half, but only so many of those plays can be drawn up in a week. Once those new tactics were exhausted, Seattle didn't really have much else at their disposal to confuse San Francisco's defense.

The Chargers blowing out the Jaguars in the first half was a little shocking. If there's any doubt otherwise, let this be yet further proof that coaching really does matter. Both of these teams are similar in construction too, making this result all the more unexpected. But Brandon Staley instructed his defensive backs to play closer to the line of scrimmage and that seems to have made all the more difference - Trevor Lawrence has been unable to connect on those short throws that have been critical in helping this Jaguars offense build some rhythm. Without those routes in the flat, Jacksonville's offense has been effectively neutered.

Yet, in the second half....all that didn't matter. Jacksonville was able to stage the third largest comeback in postseason history. The Chargers only managed to post up three points while the Jaguars did just enough to steal away the win at the very moment. I'm still not entirely certain what happened in the second half either. The inside routes were there as well as the occasional deep shots. It's not like the Jaguars suddenly changed tune from the third quarter onward and committed to a style of football different from one that prioritizes short and efficient passing.

It's possible Los Angeles simply decided to run out the clock after halftime, absolutely oblivious to Jacksonville's recent history of near-miraculous comebacks. Or it's possible that the Jaguars were collectively stricken by anxiety given this was the first foray into the postseason for so many people across that roster. I need to rewatch this game just to see what exactly changed between the two halves. Either way, kudos to the Jaguars or winning their first playoff game in the Doug Pederson and Trevor Lawrence era.

What a hilarious comedy of errors this Bills game against the Dolphins has become. Josh Allen's mistakes have been single-handedly responsible for Miami taking the lead in the third quarter. Skylar Thompson hasn't done much predictably.

That being said, Miami has a very good foundation here with a defensive loaded with stars along its defensive front. To nail Josh Allen for seven sacks isn't easy for any defense, period. If the Dolphins can sew up some loose threads along that offense, expect a team that should be competitive in the foreseeable future.

One of the reasons I thought the Vikings would have the upper hand in their contest against the Giants would be their experience in elimination game scenarios. Other than one mistake from Daniel Bellinger, New York hasn't shown me anything indicating that this playoff atmosphere is too much for them to handle. I might need to rethink the value of playoff experience. Even if the team's saddled with the yips, how long is it really expected to last? 

I think I might need to shift more attention to special teams and field goal kickers instead. Maybe assess field goal kickers making their first postseason start and see how well they tend to perform versus league average.

The Bengals worry me. Even if they win against the Ravens, this game revealed some serious deficiencies, namely that defensive front. I picked the Bengals to win the Super Bowl this year based on the contingency that some of their top defensive linemen will round into elite form in the playoffs. It's not happening. Trey Hendricksen, Sam Hubbard, and even D.J. Reader have whiffed a number of times tonight on critical plays.

On top of that, Tee Higgins may be overrated. And if that's the case and their ground game is unable to get going against Baltimore's front, then they only have one viable weapon on offense - Ja'Marr Chase.

A team missing any teeth on both offense and defense isn't cut for the championship. Did I really misread this club that badly or is there another dynamic involved here that I'm missing? Nobody tends to play Cincinnati tougher than the Ravens.
