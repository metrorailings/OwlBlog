## Ravens @ Dolphins

Dolphins are firing away recklessly on jailbreak blitzes and Baltimore/Lamar are simply refusing to take advantage of their gambles. Just throw the ball to the middle. Stop chancing throws outside the numbers.

The field is incredibly slick. Everybody is having some difficulty moving around, but Lamar especially is having trouble. So much of his game relies on mobility and elusiveness, so not having that element to his game at his disposal doesn't help.

## Bills @ Jets

Worth assessing whether Mike White is still throwing the ball ridiculously short or at least taking deep shots, even in unfavorable moments.

***

## Browns @ Patriots

Baker Mayfield is playing pretty horribly. And now with New England running the score up, things aren't shaping up well for Cleveland. If the Browns refuse to stick by their ground game, it could be ugly.

## Buccaneers @ Washington

Leonard Fournette is clearly a point of emphasis for Tampa Bay's offense this game. I feel that Washington is overplaying things in the secondary, forcing Tom to rely more on runs and quick passes to Fournette in the flat.

I'm questioning Mike Evans role in this offense. Not seeing enough of him. Also, where's Scotty Miller?

Brady's not a fan of holding the ball. If the deep options don't present themselves viably right away, expect a dump pass. Though Brady will hold every now and then, but it's clear he's not a fan of holding given his tendency to throw the ball away when absolutely forced.

Washington's pass protection has been phenomenal, especially against blitzes. While the Buccaneers have gotten their fair share of hits on Heinecke, his offensive linemen have held up more often than not.

Well, it's clear Tampa Bay needs a healthy Rob Gronkowski and Antonio Brown back in the worst possible way. Without the two of them and Mikes Evans blanketed in double coverage, things go from tolerable to wretched pretty quickly.

## Vikings @ Chargers

Kirk Cousins is so bad, it's too funny. What a funny way to fumble the ball.

Love seeing Justin Herbert yell at his receivers. That passion needs to be there.

I feel as if the Chargers need a tight end or another player capable of running seam routes as well as routes up the middle. Keenan Allen alone can't carry the burden in that respect. Jared Cook has been essentially useless.

Justin Jefferson is finally turned up.

Eric Kendricks out-played Keenan Allen for an interception. Not good to have your lunch eaten by a linebacker as a wide receiver.

Herbert only has about 70-80 passing yards in the first half. Appropriately, Mike Williams has been a non-factor in the game outside of the late drive closing out the first half. I'm not sure the Bolts can recover from their current deficit.

## Seahawks @ Packers

Looks like Seahawks are committing to bracket coverage on Davante Adams, Will be interesting to see how Green Bay adjusts to give Adams open windows.

Mason Crosby is just terrible.

Green Bay being able to succeed on short-yardage runs against the likes of Bobby Wagner is impressive. That being said, Seattle has done a decent job defensing the run.

Seems like the Seahawks are incorporating the Staley style of defense into their defensive repertoire.

## Chiefs @ Raiders

It took awhile, but finally it happened - Mahomes has committed to the short game, as much as he may despise doing so. The Chiefs offensive success this game was built very heavily on the short passing game combined with  dashes of Harris rushing the ball.

Maybe thanks to the short game, Kansas City was able to line up some deep shots towards Tyreek Hill. Some were successful, some were ill-advised, but the shot opportunities were there now.

Mahomes is still being reckless with the ball every now and then. Against better-disciplined defenses, his mistakes and freelancing would have been punished.

The Raiders are just horrible on discipline. Talk about some silly penalties. I'm not sure if the Raiders were trying to beat the Chiefs on the snap count, but so many times were these Raiders caught trespassing the line of scrimmage before the snap. 

On the other hand, the Chiefs have the Las Vegas ground game read. Their efforts to study Derek Carr and his audibles seem to have paid off.

It's clear the Chiefs entered this game with that underdog vibe. Contrary to the spread, Las Vegas attended this game blinded by a bit of cockiness.
