## Ravens @ Dolphins

Dolphins are firing away recklessly on jailbreak blitzes and Baltimore/Lamar are simply refusing to take advantage of their gambles. Just throw the ball to the middle. Stop chancing throws outside the numbers.

The field is incredibly slick. Everybody is having some difficulty moving around, but Lamar especially is having trouble. So much of his game relies on mobility and elusiveness, so not having that element to his game at his disposal doesn't help.

## Browns @ Patriots

Baker Mayfield is playing pretty horribly. And now with New England running the score up, things aren't shaping up well for Cleveland. If the Browns refuse to stick by their ground game, it could be ugly.
