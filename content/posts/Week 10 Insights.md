## Ravens @ Dolphins

Dolphins are firing away recklessly on jailbreak blitzes and Baltimore/Lamar are simply refusing to take advantage of their gambles. Just throw the ball to the middle. Stop chancing throws outside the numbers.

The field is incredibly slick. Everybody is having some difficulty moving around, but Lamar especially is having trouble. So much of his game relies on mobility and elusiveness, so not having that element to his game at his disposal doesn't help.

## Bills @ Jets

Worth assessing whether Mike White is still throwing the ball ridiculously short or at least taking deep shots, even in unfavorable moments.

## Browns @ Patriots

Baker Mayfield is playing pretty horribly. And now with New England running the score up, things aren't shaping up well for Cleveland. If the Browns refuse to stick by their ground game, it could be ugly.

## Buccaneers @ Washington

Leonard Fournette is clearly a point of emphasis for Tampa Bay's offense this game. I feel that Washington is overplaying things in the secondary, forcing Tom to rely more on runs and quick passes to Fournette in the flat.

I'm questioning Mike Evans role in this offense. Not seeing enough of him. Also, where's Scotty Miller?

Brady's not a fan of holding the ball. If the deep options don't present themselves viably right away, expect a dump pass. Though Brady will hold every now and then, but it's clear he's not a fan of holding given his tendency to throw the ball away when absolutely forced.

Washington's pass protection has been phenomenal, especially against blitzes. While the Buccaneers have gotten their fair share of hits on Heinecke, his offensive linemen have held up more often than not.

Well, it's clear Tampa Bay needs a healthy Rob Gronkowski and Antonio Brown back in the worst possible way. Without the two of them and Mikes Evans blanketed in double coverage, things go from tolerable to wretched pretty quickly.
