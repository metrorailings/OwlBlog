Bad start by the Chiefs - a three and out. A 2nd down sack by Correa set the Chiefs back a little too far. Titans looking more impressive so far.

The Chiefs offense is struggling. Sometimes due to drops, but other times due to the Titans playing aggressively in their pass coverage and winning their battles at the line of scrimmage. The Titans have been getting pressure on Mahomes, strangely enough. Not sure how or why. Either way, this is markedly different from the situation last week against the Texans. The Texans weren't winning any of their battles collectively as a defensive unit. The Titans are seeing more success though.

Brilliant adjustment by the Chiefs in the second half. The Titans are dedicating too many of their resources to stopping the big passing attack. As a result, the Chiefs have been making hay with rushes, quarterback scrambles, and short passes. The Titans have been powerless to stop these plays.

Despite the big win, the Chiefs made a number of silly mistakes here. Notably silly mistakes by their defense that awarded free yards to the Titans and an incredibly dumb oversight on special teams when it was somewhat obvious the Titans would be running a fake punt. Andy Reid may be a great offensive mind, but his attention to other details and his commitment to discipline is a little questionable.
