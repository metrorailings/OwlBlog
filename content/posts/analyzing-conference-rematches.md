Something dawned on me now that the conference finals this year will be rematches between teams that faced each other once before earlier in the year. Do teams that lose the first match have an advantage in the playoff rematch?

To find out, let's analyze data going back to 2009.

## 2009

_Regular Season_

* **Colts (17)** @ Ravens (15)
* Colts (15) @ **Jets (29)**
* Ravens (21) @ **Patriots (27)**
* Bengals (0) @ **Jets (37)**
* **Packers (33)** @ Cardinals (7)

_Playoffs_

* Ravens (3) @ **Colts (20)**
* Jets (17) @ **Colts (30)**
* **Ravens (33)** @ Patriots (14)
* **Jets (24)** @ Bengals (14)
* Packers (45) @ **Cardinals (51)**

We have the same result in 3 matches and different results in 3 matches. Some games here have circumstances worth mentioning - in the Colts loss to the Jets, Peyton Manning was pulled early for some strange reason. Apparently, Jim Caldwell didn't care much about maintaining an undefeated record through the season. The Jets-Bengals games were literally back-to-back, as their regular season encounter took place on the last week of the season. Oddly enough, the Cowboys and the Eagles were in a similar situation, playing each other on the last week of the season only to have to play each other again in the Wild Card round. The games played out the same way both ways - the Cowboys were able to win in domineering fashion. It makes me wonder whether the second meeting between two teams meeting one another on consecutive weeks favors the winner of the first meeting.

Once again, we have another incidence here of teams meeting one another on back-to-back meetings - the Packers and the Cardinals. However, the Cardinals trotted out their back-up quarterback in the first match, so the rematch was a little different. Aaron Rodgers and his crew were able to rack up more points in the rematch though.

## 2010

_Regular Season_

* **Packers (27)** @ Eagles (20)
* Packers (17) @ **Falcons (20)**
* **Jets (22)** @ Steelers (17)
* Seahawks (19) @ **Saints (34)**
* **Seahawks (23)** @ Bears (20)

_Playoffs_

* **Packers (21)** @ Eagles (16)
* **Packers (48)** @ Falcons (21)
* Jets (19) @ **Steelers (24)**
* Saints (36) @ **Seahawks (41)**
* Seahawks (24) @ **Bears (35)**

We have the same result in 1 match and different results in 4 matches. Once again, a caveat here worth noting for the one set of games with the same results. The first match between the Packers and the Eagles took place on the first week of the season, so I'm not too sure whether that game can be justifiably linked to its playoff counterpart given that the first week of the season tends to be a bit wild.

## 2011

_Regular Season_

* **Packers (38)** @ Giants (35)
* Giants (20) @ **49ers (27)**
* **Patriots (41)** @ Broncos (23)
* Lions (17) @ **Saints (31)**
* **Texans (20)** @ Bengals (19)
* Texans (14) @ **Ravens (29)**

_Playoffs_

* **Giants (37)** @ Packers (20)
* **Giants (20)** @ 49ers (17)
* Broncos (10) @ **Patriots (45)**
* Lions (28) @ **Saints (45)**
* Bengals (10) @ **Texans (31)**
* Texans (13) @ **Ravens (20)**

We have the same result in 4 matches and different results in 2 matches. Not much to caveat here, though it is worth noting the Texans were forced to go down their quarterback depth chart in the rematch against the Bengals. Not that it mattered much though, as Houston was still able to pull out the win.

## 2012

_Regular Season_

* Patriots (30) @ **Ravens (31)**
* Ravens (17) @ **Broncos (34)**
* **49ers (30)** @ Packers (22)
* Texans (14) @ **Patriots (42)**

_Playoffs_

* **Ravens (28)** @ Patriots (13)
* **Ravens (38)** @ Broncos (35)
* Packers (31) @ **49ers (45)**
* Texans (28) @ **Patriots (41)**

We have the same result in 3 matches and a different result in 1 match.

It is worth noting that in the postseason rematch, all the losers in the first meeting did far better from a points perspective. Even the Packers, who were quite frankly lucky to have posted up 22 points against the 49ers in their first encounter.

## 2013

_Regular Season_

* Saints (7) @ **Seahawks (34)**
* Broncos (31) @ **Patriots (34)**
* **Colts (23)** @ Chiefs (7)
* **Bengals (17)** @ Chargers (10)
* Packers (28) @ **49ers (34)**
* 49ers (9) @ **Panthers (10)**

_Playoffs_

* Saints (15) @ **Seahawks (23)**
* Patriots (16) @ **Broncos (26)**
* Chiefs (44) @ **Colts (45)**
* **Chargers (27)** @ Bengals (10)
* **49ers (23)** @ Packers (20)
* **49ers (23)** @ Panthers (10)

We have the same result in 3 matches and different results in 3 matches. It's worth noting the 49ers win against the Packers in the regular season came in the first week of the season. Nonetheless, I do see a theme here - the losers in the regular season performed better in the playoff rematch.

## 2014

_Regular Season_

* **Patriots (42)** @ Colts (20)
* Packers (16) @ **Seahawks (36)**
* **Seahawks (13)** @ Panthers (9)
* Bengals (0) @ **Colts (27)**

_Playoffs_

* Colts (7) @ **Patriots (45)**
* Packers (22) @ **Seahawks (28)**
* Panthers (17) @ **Seahawks (31)**
* Bengals (10) @ **Colts (26)**

We have the same result in all 4 conference rematches. Little disappointing to say the least. Looks like this theory is on its way to being shot down.

## 2015

_Regular Season_

* Broncos (27) @ **Steelers (34)**
* Patriots (24) @ **Broncos (30)**
* **Panthers (27)** @ Seahawks (23)
* **Seahawks (38)** @ Vikings (7)
* Packers (8) @ **Cardinals (38)**
* Texans (20) @ **Chiefs (27)**

_Playoffs_

* Steelers (16) @ **Broncos (23)**
* Patriots (18) @ **Broncos (20)**
* Seahawks (24) @ **Panthers (31)**
* **Seahawks (10)** @ Vikings (9)
* Packers (20) @ **Cardinals (26)**
* Texans (0) @ **Chiefs (30)**

We have the same result in 5 matches and a different result in 1 match. It's worth noting both of Denver's rematches involved a different starting quarterback. It's also worth noting that the Patriots would have likely won the first match had the injury gods not dealt them a major blow midway through the game.

Also, the Vikings were _so close_ to upsetting the Seahawks in their playoff rematch. Still, the fact that they slashed the point deficit down 31 points is testament to this idea that losers from the first match tend to fare better in the rematch. Same with the Packers nearly stealing the win from the Cardinals despite fielding a depleted receiver corps. Only the Texans disappoint here, faring so much worse against the Chiefs in the postseason despite losing against them earlier in the season. It does make sense though, given Bill O'Brien's well-documented history of failure.

## 2018

_Regular Season_

* Cowboys (13) @ **Seahawks (24)**
* Eagles (7) @ **Saints (48)**
* **Ravens (22)** @ Chargers (10)
* Chiefs (40) @ **Patriots (43)**
* Rams (35) @ **Saints (45)**

_Playoffs_

* Seahawks (22) @ **Cowboys (24)**
* Eagles (14) @ **Saints (20)**
* **Chargers (23)** @ Ravens (17)
* **Patriots (37)** @ Chiefs (31)
* **Rams (26)** @ Saints (23)

We have the same result in 1 match and different results in 1 match.

The Eagles faced off against the Saints with a different quarterback leading them in the playoffs. Philadelphia fared much better in that rematch, one score away from taking the win, though the caveat here is that Drew Brees was clearly injured and not the same in the postseason compared to the regular season.
