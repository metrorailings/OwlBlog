Under Matt Nagy, the Chicago Bears have gone from being considered the dregs of the NFC North division to being crowned the Kings of the North. Barring an unlikely loss by the Rams, Chicago is locked in as the third seed of the National Football Conference.

#### Quarterback: _Mitchell Trubisky_

Mitch sucks. Not only is he horribly inaccurate, but some keen-eyed analysts have observed that the kid may simply be incapable of throwing the ball to the left. Which, if true...is big.

#### Offensive Weapons: _Tarik Cohen, Mitchell Trubisky_

A bit of an odd situation here. Tarik Cohen is the team's second-string running back, but the guy easily ranks as the best skill player on the offense. thanks largely to his ability as a catch the ball and generate big yards afterwards. His rushing numbers aren't too shabby either - his yards per rush are significantly higher than Jordan Howard's.

The other key weapon is Mitchell Trubisky himself. For as terrible a passer as he is, the guy is a phenomenal scrambler. The Patriots game was a shining example of his ability to extend plays and run circles around defenders.

Allen Robinson is notably absent here. Frankly, the man doesn't quite pass the eye test. And when you stitch together various statistics, it becomes evident that he's not vital to this Bears offense - his third down numbers are rather ordinary (especially when compared to the other major receivers on the team) and he generates less than 2 yards per route run, according to Pro Football Focus.

#### Elite Pass Rushers: _Khalil Mack, Akiem Hicks_

The Bears boast a pair of elite defensive linemen in Khalil Mack and Akiem Hicks. Little needs to be said justify either player's classification as an elite pass rusher. Mack will always be a perennial candidate for Defensive Player of the Year so long as he remains healthy. And as for Akiem Hicks, the man has been a force in the trenches, quickly collapsing pockets from his tackle position. While his pressure numbers are down from last year, Hicks still impresses on a regular basis - his Pro Bowl selection is a testament to that fact.

#### Playoff Experience

The Bears were bottom feeders for several years. It's no surprise that most of the players on the team lack real playoff experience. The few players that do have postseason experience on the team were all imports from other teams.

That being said, Chicago's defensive front seven boasts key players with recent playoff appearances - Khalil Mack, Akiem Hicks, and Danny Trevathan. So I do expect the front two units of the defense to be significantly less hit by nerves than the rest of the team.

#### Coach: _Matt Nagy (HC), Vic Fangio (DC)_

Kudos to both of these coaches and their general manager Ryan Pace. These three have transformed the Bears into one of the best teams in the NFL. Statement wins against the Packers, Vikings, and Rams truly confirmed that this team is for real.

Matt Nagy especially deserves more praise for engineering a functional offense despite the liability playing at quarterback. The Bears currently ranking in the top ten of offensive points scored will never stop shocking the hell out of me.

#### Prognosis / Outlook

If the Bears meet the Eagles in the first round...Chicago fans will need to wait another year to taste a playoff victory. But if it's the Vikings instead traveling to the Windy City come Wild Card weekend...then the Bears may make their way to the final four.
