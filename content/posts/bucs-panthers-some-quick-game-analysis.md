Just some real quick analysis....

The Panthers played phenomenal here, much to my surprise. And yet, a part of me still has questions of whether the Panthers are actually a legitimate playoff threat.

Their success in the last game was predicated on two things - devilishly creative play-calling and an eagerness to blitz against an offense that has _absolutely_ no ability to read an incoming blitz.

Don't believe me? Well, let me show you a few plays that stood out to me.

Look at that double-reverse. You don't see many teams running that type of play, but the Panthers have the exact right personnel to run that type of play - a threatening runner in Christian McCaffrey and two swiss-knife playmakers in DJ Moore and Damiere Byrd. The defense was completely out of sorts by the time  DJ Moore began motioning uphill.

Look at that blitz being telegraphed prior to the ball being snapped. And yet the blitz still manages to throw Fitzpatrick into a tizzy.

The Buccaneers began coming back in the second half, in part because Tampa Bay managed to neutralize the blitz every now and then. But it wasn't enough against a team that literally laid 35 points before the first half even ended.
