Some quick points...

* For once, I was right on the money with my quick little analysis. Lamar Jackson's inexperience held him back for most of the game.  
* More importantly, the Chargers drafted a much better game plan in this rematch. Los Angeles dedicated so many more defensive resources to the run this time around. The Chargers were daring the Ravens to throw the ball and Lamar Jackson simply shriveled up under the postseason spotlight.  
* Melvin Ingram had his way with the offensive line here. Joey Bosa had his moments as well, particular when lining up against the guards/center. But Ingram was fantastic. The Ravens seemed almost powerless against him.  
* The Ravens' best moments
