The Chargers fly again to the east coast this weekend, this time to contend against the New England Patriots.

The Chargers nearly have a complete team. And it puts them in position to pull off an upset here. New England can still win this game, but it will not be easy. Los Angeles comes into this game with the superior pass rush, headlined by Melvin Ingram and Joey Bosa. I expect Tom Brady to be harangued regularly.

Hunter Henry also makes his season debut in this game. While his snap count will be limited, Henry could have a major impact, as the Chargers are missing that dependable tight end that can run all sorts of routes from the book-ends of the offensive line. Antonio Gates has been trying his best to fulfill that role this year, but age has caught up to him. It is worth noting though...that Gates was simply fantastic last game against the Ravens. His receptions on third down kept the chains moving on 3 of the Chargers' scoring drives. Rivers came to rely on Gates more than Keenan Allen on third downs! So if anything, Los Angeles has some legitimate hope at the tight-end position - if Gates and Henry can work in tandem to provide Philip Rivers a reliable target at tight end, then Los Angeles winning is a very _very_ real possibility.

I'm not ready to crown Los Angeles as the favorite here. New England still deserves to be the favorite in this game. For all their shortcomings this year, the Patriots do have one thing that the Chargers don't have - the best head coach in the game. Bill Belichick is a legend. And I'm not sure if Anthony Lynn is ready to match wits with Belichick. To his credit though, Lynn and his defensive coordinator Gus Bradley drafted a phenomenal game plan against the Ravens last week. So if anything, I'll be treating this game as the real litmus test to determine how far Anthony Lynn has come along the last few years as head coach. To be honest, I had little faith in the man before the season started. But this year's Chargers are a different beast, and the man needs to be given his due for the team's resurgence this season.
