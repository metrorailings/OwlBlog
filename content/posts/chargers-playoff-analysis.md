The \~Los Angeles\~ San Diego Chargers are destined for the 5th seed in the American Football Conference playoffs. Despite a crummy home field advantage, the Bolts have rode high on some MVP-quality play from Philip Rivers.

#### Quarterback: _Philip Rivers_

As I said before, Philip Rivers has played like an elite quarterback. There's a reason his name has been thrown about in MVP discussions.

#### Offensive Weapons: _Keenan Allen, Melvin Gordon_

It feels odd that the Chargers only have two solid offensive skill players, despite all their success in the passing game this season. But seriously speaking, none of the other weapons the Chargers field have been consistently reliable. Mike Williams had a fantastic showing in Kansas City...but outside of that performance, his contributions have been a little muted.

In fact, look at their target rates. Keenan Allen's star receiver status is bolstered by the fact that he's targeted by Rivers on 27% of his routes. Mike Williams and Tyrell Williams are only targeted on 16% and 13% of their routes, respectively. All three running backs are targeted more frequently than either of the Williams receivers.

The reality is that the Chargers only have two solid weapons on their offense, but those two weapons have been spectacular. Pair them with a quarterback that loves throwing quality deep balls (even under pressure) and you have the makings of a very productive offense.

#### Elite Pass Rushers: _Melvin Ingram, Joey Bosa_

Melvin Ingram certainly deserves his billing as an elite pass rusher. His Pro Bowl invitation is not meant to be taken lightly, especially given that the Chargers fan base is probably one of the least passionate out there.

Joey Bosa, on the other hand, has me a bit wary.  His return from injury has been uninspiring, to say the least. Though from a statistical perspective, racking up 8 quarterback hits in 6 games is pretty commendable. So even though I'll list the guy as an elite edge rusher (as other coaches would doubtlessly), I do expect his defensive contributions to be dampened in the playoffs.

#### Playoff Experience

The Chargers lack recent playoff experience. Some Charger stalwarts like Philip Rivers and Melvin Ingram last saw postseason action back in 2014, when \~Los Angeles\~ San Diego earned a playoff berth as a sixth seed. Several other players like Casey Heyward, Russell Okung, and Brandon Mebane have more recent playoff experience on past teams.

However, the Bolts have played in elimination-style games as recently as last year. Not only were they a hair's length away from being a wild-card team, the Chargers actually contended for the division championship late in the season against the Chiefs. Philip Rivers was a disaster in that game - when it's been awhile since you've experienced that type of mental pressure, it leaves you rusty and prone to stupid mistakes.

So in the end, I think this team does have enough experience going into the playoffs, thanks to that game last year at Arrowhead. Yes, the Chargers lost that game in the ugliest way possible, but the experience left them with that mentality teams need to ward off postseason jitters.

#### Coach: _Anthony Lynn (HC), Gus Bradley (DC), Ken Whisenhunt (OC)_

It's hard to evaluate coaches sometimes. We have to be careful using statistics, as these statistics are derived from player actions. We can try to examine their macro game-planning to get a sense of their philosophies and intentions, but it's hard sometimes to evaluate these game plans if the players fail to execute properly on them.

The best way to evaluate coaching staffs is to look at their live decision-making during games and look at the way a team evolves as the season progresses. And even then, that may only provide limited insight.

In this case, what I've seen from Anthony Lynn seems to indicate that he's a player's coach. And while guys love playing under a coach that can sympathize with them, it is usually not the best way to run a team. In this case, it took weeks for the man to fire a kicker that was failing the team. That being said, this does not preclude them from winning a championship.

#### Prognosis / Outlook

I do expect the Chargers to survive Wild Card round should they face the Ravens or Colts. But the division round will be the end of the road for them if they have to travel to Arrowhead Stadium. If they're lucky enough, the Titans might bail them out here should they make the playoffs...then the Chargers may actually reach the conference championships.
