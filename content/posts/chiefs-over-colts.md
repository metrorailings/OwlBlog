Just a few points to make about the Chiefs and their division round victory over the Colts.

* Any doubts I may have had about the Chiefs' championship prospects have been quieted. All 3 of their star pass rushers made their presence known throughout the game. Mahomes played with some admirable composure in his first real postseason game. The running game came back alive behind Damien Williams. If the run game stays alive, Kansas City is easily the most complete team alive in the postseason.  

  

* The penalty bug seems to have passed from Houston over to Indianapolis. The Colts committed so many silly pre-snap penalties, some of which sustained key scoring drives for the Chiefs.  

  

* Andrew Luck and the offense seem...discombobulated? It looks to me that the Colts lost that offensive mojo that so many people and gamblers found so endearing. Andrew Luck had trouble connected with all of his major playmakers, especially T.Y. Hilton. Maybe Hilton's injuries finally caught up with him today? Or maybe it was the cold weather and snowy conditions that threw the Colts off into disarray.
