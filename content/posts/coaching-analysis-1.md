So for the first time in Owl Blog history, I'll be keeping tabs on coaches here. By tracking these coaches, their core competencies, and their overall level of success, I can better predict games going forward.

### Los Angeles Rams

_Coaching:_ Sean McVay (HC/OC), Raheem Morris (DC)

The Rams have solid management. McVay's offensive coaching could use some work, especially given the pathetic showing by the Rams offense in the Super Bowl. On top of that, his playbook has been criticized as being too simple, a weakness which is all too easily exposed against the league's better defensive minds. Still, the play-action and the outside zone runs still hit gold against lesser coaches and teams. 

Still, Raheem Morris coming into the organization last year and successfully running Brandon Staley's style of defense was remarkable, considering it's a philosophy that was (more or less) forced upon him as a prerequisite for taking the coordinator job. That defensive line was far more productive too. Not only was Aaron Donald playing some of the best football of his career, but the team also found a complementary piece in Von Miller. Without Von Miller as the book-end rusher working in tandem with Donald, I honestly question whether the Rams could have won the Super Bowl. Credit to Raheem Morris though for finding ways to pull even more production from these men. 

Matthew Stafford's arrival also worked some wonders when it came to the team overcoming adverse momentum. Under Jared Goff, McVay and his men weren't that successful navigating against negative game script. For the Rams to win, it would almost always take them require them to hold the lead by the start of the fourth quarter. That changed considerably under Stafford in 2021, as the Rams were able to mount a total of 4 noteworthy comebacks, 3 more than the total number of comebacks they were able to wager in 2019 and 2020 _combined_.  

Nothing substantial has changed in the offseason, so expect the Rams to be one of the better franchises in the league in terms of management.  Von Miller will certainly be missed though, but Leonard Floyd should be able to compensate with his occasional flashes here and there.
