## Buccaneers @ Packers

Jaire Alexander not traveling with Mike Evans. As a result, Evans was able to get free on multiple third downs en route to a Buccaneers touchdown. What's wrong with you, Pettine?

Meanwhile, Tampa Bay's coverage corners are holding up ridiculously well against Green Bay's receivers. Kudos to Todd Bowles for not making the same mistake he made earlier in the year against Kansas City, when he assigned a single cornerback to cover Tyreek Hill. Whatever he's doing has been good enough to keep Davante Adams contained.

Brady playing very well. Offensive line giving him so much protection too.

Packers defense is getting clapped early. I think I made a mistake calling Pettine a quality coach here. Reality is that his defense is getting absolutely played by Tampa Bay and the sheer number of weapons they have.

Tom Brady may have been the offensive mastermind behind Tampa Bay's offense the whole time.

Finally, excellent work from Matt LaFuck! He's now choosing the run the ball along the edges of Tampa Bay's defense by pulling guards, tight ends, and receivers as lead blockers. Long overdue considering Tampa Bay's defense was loading up along the middle.
