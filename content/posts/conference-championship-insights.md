## Buccaneers @ Packers

Jaire Alexander not traveling with Mike Evans. As a result, Evans was able to get free on multiple third downs en route to a Buccaneers touchdown. What's wrong with you, Pettine?

Meanwhile, Tampa Bay's coverage corners are holding up ridiculously well against Green Bay's receivers. Kudos to Todd Bowles for not making the same mistake he made earlier in the year against Kansas City, when he assigned a single cornerback to cover Tyreek Hill. Whatever he's doing has been good enough to keep Davante Adams contained.

Brady playing very well. Offensive line giving him so much protection too.

Packers defense is getting clapped early. I think I made a mistake calling Pettine a quality coach here. Reality is that his defense is getting absolutely played by Tampa Bay and the sheer number of weapons they have.

Tom Brady may have been the offensive mastermind behind Tampa Bay's offense the whole time.

Finally, excellent work from Matt LaFuck! He's now choosing the run the ball along the edges of Tampa Bay's defense by pulling guards, tight ends, and receivers as lead blockers. Long overdue considering Tampa Bay's defense was loading up along the middle. 

Jason Pierre-Paul making his presence known.

It's becoming clear to me Tampa Bay has way too many weapons for its own good. Add on top of that the mind of the greatest quarterback ever to play the game and it seems to me the Buccaneers are too stacked on offense to stop.

Horrible call from Mike Pettine to call man coverage on the last play against the Buccaneers to close out the first half. With only so many seconds left on the clock, all Pettine had to do is keep the ball underneath them by playing a soft zone. Instead, he risked man coverage and Brady threw up a dime ball to the speedy Scottie Miller. Even Tony Dungy is calling out his ass for making such a bad call.

I guess last year's 49ers game should have shown me that this Packers team can't quite adjust against opponents that've thoroughly smashed them.

What a flaccid start for the Packers to open the second half.

Tampa's defense doing a great job crashing down on the bootlegs.
