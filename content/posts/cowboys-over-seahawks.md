Just a few points to make about the Cowboys win over the Seahawks...

* If the definition of insanity is doing something over and over again expecting different results...then the Seahawks offensive game plan is the quintessential example of insanity. Constantly running the ball up the middle of this Seahawks defense did not work was nothing but  exercises in futility.
* Dallas had the more dynamic offense here. The Cowboys involved were able to incorporate receivers other than Amari Cooper into the offensive game plan. Michael Gallup caught a tough fade for a touchdown and Cole Beasley converted a few key 3rd downs. Honestly, the Cowboys offense was better coached compared to the Seahawks offense. This loss is largely on Pete Carroll and his stubborn insistence on running the ball.
* But Dallas deserves credit too. Dak Prescott avoided making mistakes. Despite Seattle's best attempts, Dak avoided fumbling the ball or throwing a silly interception. His only interception came on a defensive pass interference that the referees did not call.
