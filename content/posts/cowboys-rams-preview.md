The Ladyboys travel to Los Angeles to face off against the second-seeded Rams.

![](/uploads/Division Round Analysis - Cowboys @ Rams.jpg)The Rams are justifiably the favorites here. In all categories outside of coaching and home field advantage, the Cowboys manage draw even against Los Angeles. But it's that latter exception that should concern Dallas. Jason Garrett is still a questionable coach, especially on the road. His refusal to incorporate his quarterback's mobility into his offense is idiotic. The Cowboys desperately need another dimension of offense early in the year, but Garrett and offensive coordinator Scott Linehan simply refused to leverage the speed of their Dak Prescott's running ability. Even with Amari Cooper factored into things here, the Cowboys need more diversity on offense should they want to survive road playoff games. Now I did see Dak execute a few designed run plays last week against the Seahawks, but I still doubt whether Garrett truly wants his captain on offense running around.

Besides that, Jason Garrett made a few other questionable decisions over the course of the season. His refusal to be bold on 4th down at various points through the season, his willingness to play most of his starters the last week of the regular season...it's made me doubt him.

On the other side, you have Sean McVay, who has done a yeoman's work in hiding his quarterback's deficiencies for much of the season. Jared Goff has some fantastic statistics this season, but his games in Chicago and against Philadelphia have shown me that the second-year player has some notable drawbacks in his play. Without the benefit of a strong run game and playing from behind, the man wilts from the pressure. Todd Gurley is more important to the offense than Jared Goff, simply put. I don't mean to minimize Goff's role here, but Gurley is the foundational piece that motivates the entire offense.

So this game seems to have come down home field advantage and coaching, and I'd much rather side with the wunderkind and Wade Phillips over Jason Garrett and his ilk.
