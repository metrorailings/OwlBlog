## Ravens @ Bills

Baltimore wanted to run the ball so badly, but it seemed the Bills had a beat on the inner workings of their ground game. Add the speed of their linebackers into the equation and Buffalo was able to stymie Baltimore's leading rushers, namely Lamar.

The winds swirling around Buffalo really made life hell for both teams. Neither of them could really get their passing game going. On top of that, receivers struggled catching shaky balls, centers had a tough time snapping cleanly, and place kickers couldn't even buy field goals, let alone kick them through the uprights.
