## Ravens @ Bills

Baltimore wanted to run the ball so badly, but it seemed the Bills had a beat on the inner workings of their ground game. Add the speed of their linebackers into the equation and Buffalo was able to stymie Baltimore's leading rushers, namely Lamar.

The winds swirling around Buffalo really made life hell for both teams. Neither of them could really get their passing game going. On top of that, receivers struggled catching shaky balls, centers had a tough time snapping cleanly, and place kickers couldn't even buy field goals, let alone kick them through the uprights.

The Bills won the game largely because Sean McDermott and his defensive coaches forced Baltimore into playing ugly. I guess Greg Roman didn't throw enough wrinkles into his playbook to throw Buffalo's defense off their game plan. On top of that, the trick plays involving Hollywood Brown I saw last week were missing. Worst of all, Roman didn't even try making life easier for Lamar by having him snap under center (to keep the wind from messing around with the ball)...which tells me his system of offense completely eschews having the quarterback initiate plays directly under center. Instead, it seems like his offense is only allowed to operate from either shotgun formation or pistol formation. It's a bizarre omission considering the success of his offense is predicated on the complexity of his run package.

Coaching matters. Never forget.

## Rams @ Packers

Kudos to Sean McVay for jump-starting his team on multiple occasions using the hurry-up offense. It wasn't enough considering the Packers were harassing Jared Goff regularly. The defense did surrender some significant rushing yardage against Cam Akers. Even though the Packers defense has improved considerably from last year, the team still has issues keeping opposing rushers under wraps.
