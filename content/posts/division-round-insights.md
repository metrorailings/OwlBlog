## Vikings @ 49ers

I need to examine the Vikings average depth of target here. I'm not sure if they're attacking the flat enough here. Other than a big pass to Stefon Diggs, the Vikings passing game has been limp.

## Titans @ Ravens

Somehow, the Titans are winning. They're playing mistake-free football. Meanwhile, Lamar is playing with rust and hubris. Why do I bet on huge postseason favorites? I've already been burned last week by the Saints, now the Ravens are disappointing me.
