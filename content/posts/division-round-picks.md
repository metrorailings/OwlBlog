## Vikings @ 49ers (-7)

Believe it or not, I love the Vikings in this spot. The 49ers have home field advantage, yes, but their lack of experience and mediocre defensive coaching should ice them against a resurgent Vikings team that found its groove last week.

## Titans @ Ravens (-9.5)

Yes, the Titans did well enough last week to upset the Patriots. But it took Vrabel's inside knowledge of Belichick and his tendencies to steal the road win. Vrabel and his coaching staff won't have that same luxury here against a Baltimore team that's so much better compared to New England.

## Texans @ Chiefs (-9.5)

Surprisingly, both teams are much more alike than one would think, especially if Will Fuller is able to play. Neither team is all that resilient mentally. Both teams have electric quarterbacks. Likewise, both teams have a similar number of weapons on offense and don't really impress all too much along their defensive front.

But the Chiefs have a much better defensive backfield, better offensive coaching, and the Arrowhead advantage here. Still, this spread is too wide for a Texans team that's better than what this spread implies.

## Seahawks @ Packers (-4.5)

Honestly the hardest match to call this whole weekend. The Packers have too many question marks here, particular when it comes to coaching. This is Matt LaFleur's first real test as a head coach. Can LaFleur foster that fighting spirit in his team, that will to win that's so critical whenever a team finds itself in difficult circumstances? I'm not sure.

On the other hand, the Seahawks aren't that good of a team, so it honestly shouldn't take much to defeat them. Seattle's coaching is pretty poor overall and their defense lacks any real talent.
