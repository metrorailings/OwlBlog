The Philadelphia Eagles return to New Orleans in their quest to repeat as champions.

The Eagles do not deserve to be such crazy underdogs in this match-up.  I know, I know Philadelphia was shellacked earlier in the year when these two teams met in the Superdome...but the postseason is different from the regular season. In the regular season, teams ebb and flow. And the Eagles were clearly trending down that week while the Saints were staking their claim as the cream of the crop of the NFC. Besides, Nick Foles wasn't even playing in that game!

Philadelphia has the more complete team while New Orleans has home field advantage. Coaching is a wash here, as both Sean Payton and Doug Pederson are great coaches, so neither team can claim an advantage there.
