The Philadelphia Eagles return to New Orleans in their quest to repeat as champions.

The Eagles do not deserve to be such crazy underdogs in this match-up.  I know, I know Philadelphia was shellacked earlier in the year when these two teams met in the Superdome...but the postseason is different from the regular season. In the regular season, teams ebb and flow. And the Eagles were clearly trending down that week while the Saints were staking their claim as the cream of the crop in the NFC. Besides, Nick Foles wasn't even playing in that game!

Philadelphia has the more complete team while New Orleans has home field advantage. Yes, that's right...Philadelphia enters this contest with the better overall roster. Even though both teams only have two players on their offense worthy of being tagged as reliable offensive weaponry, the Eagles have more serviceable depth on that side of the ball compared to the Saints. Last week against the Bears, Golden Tate finally started proving his worth, catching 5 passes off 8 targets, including 1 reception for the game-winning touchdown. On top of that, Nelson Agholor has had a few brilliant moments over the past few weeks, especially on deep catches. As for the Saints, they don't really have many potentially solid depth receivers behind Michael Thomas. Only Tre'Quan Smith has shown flashes here and there over the season, but it remains to be seen whether the rookie can contribute meaningfully in big-time situations.

Furthermore, compare the defensive lines on both teams. The Saints have two promising players lining up alongside Cameron Jordan - Sheldon Rankins and Marcus Davenport. But unlike Jordan, neither can be considered elite pass rushers this season. Meanwhile, the Eagles have three great pressure rushers, two of which I've already classified as elite - Michael Bennett and Fletcher Cox. And it's vey debatable as to whether Chris Long should be considered a top-tier edge rusher as well. His pressure numbers would certainly justify such classification.

Coaching is a wash here, as both Sean Payton and Doug Pederson are great coaches, so neither team can claim an advantage there. So honestly, the spread for this game should be set far closer than what the books have listed. My biggest bet of the weekend will be on the Eagles spread. And in fact, Philadelphia can also win this game too, but only if the Eagles defensive linemen are able to consistently win the battle at the line of scrimmage.
