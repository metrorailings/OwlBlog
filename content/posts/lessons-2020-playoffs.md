Another fantastic year of football. I wish I made more money, but I learned a pretty good bit about making bets in the playoffs this year. Here, I'll enumerate all the things I've learned.

***

* Momentum is a real thing in the NFL. Its effect can be overblown at times, but it needs to be factored into any analysis regarding a team's championship prospects.
* Teams coming back in the fourth quarter or from double-digit deficits to win the game should have all these comebacks noted and factored into my analysis of their championship potential.
* Weather is a real thing. Be wary of games played in frigid weather or windy conditions.
* Always follow up on injuries. A team losing key players could present some great live betting opportunities. New Orleans losing both Taysom Hill and Dionte Harris really limited their production on offense.
* Teams coming into the postseason cold need to be doubted from the get-go. The Steelers completely clowned themselves in their loss against the Browns. And even though the Rams managed to upset the Seahawks, they still embarrassed themselves against a poorly coached Green Bay team.
* Speaking of coaches, always be wary evaluating coaches. I've always though Mike Pettine was a good coach. Never mind that anymore. Pettine may be one of the worst defensive minds in the league. Any success his defense saw was largely because of talent, not scheme. I overrated his ability based off Green Bay's defensive showing against a Tennessee team that absolutely despises cold weather. On the other side, Todd Bowles needs to be given more credit. I underrated him because his initial game plans against the Saints and the Chiefs left me unimpressed. But the fact that he was able to adapt through the game is testament enough to his competence.
