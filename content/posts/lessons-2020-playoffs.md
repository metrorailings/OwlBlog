Another fantastic year of football. I wish I made more money, but I learned a pretty good bit about making bets in the playoffs this year. Here, I'll enumerate all the things I've learned.

***

* Momentum is a real thing in the NFL. Its effect can be overblown at times, but it needs to be factored into any analysis regarding a team's championship prospects.


* Teams coming back in the fourth quarter or from double-digit deficits to win the game should have all these comebacks noted and factored into my analysis of their championship potential.


* Weather is a real thing. Be wary of games played in frigid weather or windy conditions.


* Always follow up on injuries. A team losing key players could present some great live betting opportunities. New Orleans losing both Taysom Hill and Dionte Harris really limited their production on offense.
