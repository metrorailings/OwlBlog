The 49ers may have the best set of linebackers in the league when it comes to pass coverage. Two attempts by the Packers to run routes out from the backfield ended up falling short thanks to the speed of these linebackers, led by Kwan Alexander.

The Packers refusal to stack the box more against the run is hurting them. Their defensive line is simply unable to hold steady against the ground attack. And unfortunately, that leaves mostly defensive backs to guard against the run once their first line of defense fails.

San Francisco's defensive line is winning its battles in the trenches consistently.
