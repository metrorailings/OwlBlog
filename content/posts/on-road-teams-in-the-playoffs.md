I'm beginning to realize that road teams need to be truly stacked if they're going to be making a run in the postseason. Road teams need an elite quarterback, at least 3 different weapons on offense, and at least 2 stud pass rushers. Quality coaching is a necessity as well, but coaches can only work with the resources they're given.

So anything less than that and a road team will see its offense eventually stalled or its defense eventually victimized in the postseason. You can survive a few road games with talent deficiencies at those key positions, but eventually these road teams will run into astute coaches like Bill Belichick that know how to exploit those deficits.

The Chargers were eaten alive today in New England, mostly because their offense was limited and their defensive pass rush was virtually nonexistent. Belichick worked his magic and schematically shut down Keenan Allen and Melvin Gordon. Without either of those two producing on his offense, Philip Rivers had a hell of a time trying to score points for his team. His will to win is second to none, but the man can only go as far as his options let him. On defense, Joey Bosa revealed his true colors as a bust. I made a mistake considering him elite. It was an assumption rooted in his performance from last year, but injuries have rendered him rather ordinary this season. So without a a second major pass rusher to concern them, the Patriots were able to focus more resources on Melvin Ingram, effectively keeping Brady clean on the vast majority of his snaps.

The Eagles were handled in the Big Easy, as I discussed at length in my post-game comments on that game. What hurt Philly more than their spotty pass rush or questionable coaching calls...was their limited offense. The Eagles only field two solid weapons at offense. Take the both of them away and Nick Foles was left helpless. It also hurt that some of his passes were criminally under-thrown.

There is one thing that might factor into the road teams' favor though - inexperienced quarterbacks. Inexperienced quarterbacks were a major reason we saw 3 road upsets this year in the postseason - all 3 teams that lost at home were fielding quarterbacks making their playoff debut. And it's without question that this inexperience played a major role in at least 2 of those 3 games. 

But don't stop there - go back to 2016, when the Cowboys claimed the top seed in the NFC after a sensational year from their two rookie stars in Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott. But a run wasn't in the cards for the Cowboys that season - Dak was very sluggish in the first half of the playoff game against Green Bay. He made some silly mistakes that allowed Green Bay to run up the score by several touchdowns. The Cowboys tried to stage a comeback in the second half, but thanks to some heroics from Aaron Rodgers, it was a little too late.

So road teams can be helped in that regard, but experience becomes a moot issue in the championship round and the Super Bowl. Once again, for a road team to win the Super Bowl, there is absolutely no question that the team has to be stacked.
