I'm beginning to realize that road teams need to be truly stacked if they're going to be making a run in the postseason. Road teams need an elite quarterback, at least 3 different weapons on offense, and at least 2 stud pass rushers. Quality coaching is a necessity as well, but coaches can only work with the resources they're given. 

So anything less than that and a road team will see its offense eventually stalled or its defense eventually victimized in the postseason. You can survive a few road games with talent deficiencies at those key positions, but eventually these road teams will run into astute coaches like Bill Belichick that know how to exploit those deficits.

The Chargers were eaten alive today in New England, mostly because their offense was limited and their defensive pass rush was virtually nonexistent. Belichick worked his magic and schematically shut down Keenan Allen and Melvin Gordon. Without either of those two producing on his offense, Philip Rivers had a hell of a time trying to post points for his team. His will to win is second to none, but the man can only go as far as his options let him. On defense, Joey Bosa revealed his true colors as a bust. I made a mistake considering him elite. It was an assumption rooted in his performance from last year, but injuries have rendered him rather ordinary this season. So without a a second major pass rusher to concern them, the Patriots were able to focus more resources on Melvin Ingram, effectively keeping Brady clean on the vast majority of his snaps.

The Eagles were handled in the Big Easy, as I discussed at length in my post-game comments on that game. What hurt Philly more than their spotty pass rush or questionable coaching calls...was their limited offense. The Eagles only field two solid weapons at offense. Take the both of them away and Nick Foles was left helpless. It also hurt that some of his passes were criminally under-thrown.
