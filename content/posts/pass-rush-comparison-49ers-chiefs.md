Given two weeks to strategize and the guarantee that both teams in the Super Bowl will be performing at their absolute best, the championship game usually comes down to whoever manages to punch the other in the mouth more. So in this regard, it's the pass rush then that's arguably the most important factor here - after all, the only way to truly stymie a passing game in these circumstances is to attack the sole player responsible for marshaling the offense in the air game - the quarterback.

So let's evaluate how the two teams perform against one another by comparing their performances against common opponents. When it comes to the 49ers and Chiefs, both teams have two opponents in common - the Packers and the Ravens. Let's start off with the Packers first.
