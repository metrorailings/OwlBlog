+++
Given two weeks to strategize and the guarantee that both teams in the Super Bowl will be performing at their absolute best, the championship game usually comes down to whoever manages to punch the other in the mouth more. So in this regard, it's the pass rush then that's arguably the most important factor here - after all, the only way to truly stymie a passing game in these circumstances is to attack the sole player responsible for marshaling the offense in the air game - the quarterback.

So let's evaluate how the two teams perform against one another by comparing their performances against common opponents. When it comes to the 49ers and Chiefs, both teams have two opponents in common - the Packers and the Ravens. Let's start off with the Packers first.

### Packers @ Chiefs (Week 8)

_Hurries:_ **6**

_Hits:_ **8**

_Sacks:_ **4**

_Eligible Passes Attempted:_ **35**

Impressive showing from the Chiefs here. While no one defensive lineman really stood out, Kansas City was able to hit home on multiple occasions thanks in large part to their blitzing.

It's worth noting neither Chris Jones nor Frank Clark were able to play in this game.

### Packers @ 49ers (Week 12)

_Hurries:_ **11**

_Hits:_ **3**

_Sacks:_ **6**

_Eligible Passes Attempted:_ **38**

The raw numbers are a lot less impressive than I initially thought - the 49ers only managed to post up 9 hits on Rodgers. Still, what's key is that it seemed like San Francisco had Rodgers on his heels the whole game. Despite his tendency to hold the ball and dance in the pocket, Aaron seemed all too content settling for short passes.

### Vikings @ Chiefs (Week 9)

_Hurries:_ **13**

_Hits:_ **5**

_Sacks:_ **1**

_Eligible Passes Attempted:_ **41**

Chris Jones established his reputation as the best pass rusher on this team, racking up a sack, a few hits, and a few hurries. Other than that, the Chiefs did a fairly good job applying heat to Cousins.

### Vikings @ 49ers (Division Round)

_Hurries:_ **6**

_Hits:_ **4**

_Sacks:_ **4**

_Eligible Passes Attempted:_ **25**

The 49ers did well harassing Kirk Cousins on a regular basis. Nick Bosa and Arik Armstead stood out in particular.

### Texans @ Chiefs (Division Round)

_Hurries:_ **9**

_Hits:_ **3**

_Sacks:_ **3**

_Eligible Passes Attempted:_ **35**

Frank Clark made his presence known in his return. Without the services of Chris Jones, Clark was easily the best pass rusher. The Chiefs did manage to manufacture some pressures with blitz packages.
