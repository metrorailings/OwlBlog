Rather than do quick statements discussing the Patriots and their victory over Kansas City to retain possession of the AFC crown...I'll be doing a deep dive here in order to more correctly illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this New England team as they head into the Super Bowl.

***

#### 1st Quarter

The first play of the day sets the tone for the Patriots on offense. Against a seven-man box, Sony Michel still manages to chew off 11 yards behind some excellent blocks by his offensive linemen, his fullback James Develin, and tight end Rob Gronkowski. And now it begins to dawn on me - what good is a fantastic pass rush if the defensive line is completely inept at stopping the run?

That first drive was just domination by the Patriots. The Chiefs had forced New England into a 3rd and long position near the end of the drive, but for some awful reason, the Chiefs decided to put their best edge rusher in coverage against the Patriots' best receiver. Even though Dee Ford was able to hold his own against Julian Edelman for a few seconds, the Chiefs' neutered pass rush was unable to even so much as breathe on Tom Brady, allowing for an easy completion over the middle.

Poor coaching will be a repeated emphasis here. People have ridiculed Andy Reid for his record of failure in the postseason. Some have even theorized that the man is simply unable to lead a team to the promised land. And I'm starting to believe that. Andy Reid and Bob Sutton were thoroughly out-coached here, as I'll point out time and time again.

On the Chiefs' first drive, I think it's becoming clear Patrick Mahomes is racked by nerves coming into this match. Why is he insisting on throwing the ball to Sammy Watkins twice in a row? On that first play, Travis Kelce was more open than Watkins. On the second play, Watkins was held in check by the Patriots' best cornerback in Stephon Gilmore. I understand Tyreek Hill is being blanketed in double coverage, but then the next man up should be either Travis Kelce or your speedy halfback in Damien Williams....not Sammy 'asshat' Watkins.

I think the Patriots have keyed in on an awful tendency in Mahomes' passing game - the sophomore quarterback is addicted to throwing the ball deep. Take away his best deep threat in Tyreek Hill and he'll respond by targeting Sammy Watkins instead. It makes sense - Watkins is supposed to the other skill player complimenting Hill in the deep passing offense.

It's up to Andy Reid to iron this tendency out from his young quarterback, but it's clear the veteran coach has not yet fixed this aspect of Mahomes' game. It's still not too late to make Patrick see the error of his ways, but as we'll see, very little will change as we progress in this game.

#### 2nd Quarter

The first Chiefs drive this quarter saw the Patriots pressuring Mahomes on two plays. Despite that, Kansas City was in a position to move the chains, but Damien Williams failed to punch ahead for one yard on 3rd down.

The second Chiefs drive could have ended in a touchdown. After a beautiful bomb to Tyreek Hill, Kansas City was in prime scoring position. On the very next play, the Patriots called a six-man blitz, leaving all the skill players in single coverage situations. Had Patrick Mahomes thrown a slightly better ball, Damien Williams would have had a touchdown reception here. Instead, it seems New England's pass rushers were able to suffocate pocket just enough to compel Mahomes into throwing an awkward pass. The result will go down as an incompletion, but it really was a missed opportunity to tie up the game against New England. On third down, the Patriots called yet another blitz that finally hit home and resulted in a sack that took Kansas out of field goal range. It was a sad end to the Chiefs' most promising drive up to this point.

New England, meanwhile, was able to move the ball seemingly at will. Luckily, two of their drives in the quarter ended with no points, thanks to bad plays from Tom Brady and James White. The former threw a silly interception in the end zone and the latter couldn't reel in a screen pass that would have likely gone for significant yardage.

I'll tell you what though, that last New England drive was a master class in coaching. Not only did the Patriots commit to running the ball in order to wipe as much time off the clock as possible, but New England made fools out of this Kansas City defensive line on two occasions with well-timed screens. Once again, I have to emphasize the coaching here - the Patriots have some phenomenal coaches here. I have to commend them for instilling some discipline here in their their defensive players - the Patriots box defenders rarely fell for Kansas City's attempts at misdirection and trickery.
