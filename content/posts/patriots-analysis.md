Rather than do quick statements discussing the Patriots and their victory over Kansas City to retain possession of the AFC crown...I'll be doing a deep dive here in order to more correctly illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this New England team as they head into the Super Bowl.

***

#### 1st Quarter

The first play of the day sets the tone for the Patriots on offense. Against a seven-man box, Sony Michel still manages to chew off 11 yards behind some excellent blocks by his offensive linemen, his fullback James Develin, and tight end Rob Gronkowski. And now it begins to dawn on me - what good is a fantastic pass rush if the defensive line is completely inept at stopping the run?

That first drive was just domination by the Patriots. The Chiefs had forced New England into a 3rd and long position near the end of the drive, but for some awful reason, the Chiefs decided to put their best edge rusher in coverage against the Patriots' best receiver. Even though Dee Ford was able to hold his own against Julian Edelman for a few seconds, the Chiefs' neutered pass rush was unable to even so much as breathe on Tom Brady, allowing for an easy completion over the middle.

Poor coaching will be a repeated emphasis here. People have ridiculed Andy Reid for his record of failure in the postseason. Some have even theorized that the man is simply unable to lead a team to the promised land. And I'm starting to believe that. Andy Reid and Bob Sutton were thoroughly out-coached here, as I'll point out time and time again.

On the Chiefs' first drive, I think it's becoming clear Patrick Mahomes is racked by nerves coming into this match. Why is he insisting on throwing the ball to Sammy Watkins twice in a row? On that first play, Travis Kelce was more open than Watkins. On the second play, Watkins was held in check by the Patriots' best cornerback in Stephon Gilmore. I understand Tyreek Hill is being blanketed in double coverage, but then the next man up should be either Travis Kelce or your speedy halfback in Damien Williams....not Sammy 'asshat' Watkins.

I think the Patriots have keyed in on an awful tendency in Mahomes' passing game - the sophomore quarterback is addicted to throwing the ball deep. Take away his best deep threat in Tyreek Hill and he'll respond by targeting Sammy Watkins instead. It makes sense - Watkins is supposed to the other skill player complimenting Hill in the deep passing offense.

It's up to Andy Reid to iron this tendency out from his young quarterback, but it's clear the veteran coach has not yet fixed this aspect of Mahomes' game. It's still not too late to make Patrick see the error of his ways, but as we'll see, very little will change as we progress in this game.

#### 2nd Quarter

The first Chiefs drive this quarter saw the Patriots pressuring Mahomes on two plays. Despite that, Kansas City was in a position to move the chains, but Damien Williams failed to punch ahead for one yard on 3rd down.

The second Chiefs drive could have ended in a touchdown. After a beautiful bomb to Tyreek Hill, Kansas City was in prime scoring position. On the very next play, the Patriots called a six-man blitz, leaving all the skill players in single coverage situations. Had Patrick Mahomes thrown a slightly better ball, Damien Williams would have had a touchdown reception here. Instead, it seems New England's pass rushers were able to suffocate pocket just enough to compel Mahomes into throwing an awkward pass. The result will go down as an incompletion, but it really was a missed opportunity to tie up the game against New England. On third down, the Patriots called yet another blitz that finally hit home and resulted in a sack that took Kansas out of field goal range. It was a sad end to the Chiefs' most promising drive up to this point.

New England, meanwhile, was able to move the ball seemingly at will. Luckily, two of their drives in the quarter ended with no points, thanks to bad plays from Tom Brady and James White. The former threw a silly interception in the end zone and the latter couldn't reel in a screen pass that would have likely gone for significant yardage.

I'll tell you what though, that last New England drive was a master class in coaching. Not only did the Patriots commit to running the ball in order to wipe as much time off the clock as possible, but New England made fools out of this Kansas City defensive line on two occasions with well-timed screens. Once again, I have to emphasize the coaching here - the Patriots have some phenomenal coaches here. I have to commend them for instilling some discipline here in their their defensive players - the Patriots box defenders rarely fell for Kansas City's attempts at misdirection and trickery.

#### 3rd Quarter

The Chiefs fire out of the gate with a four-play touchdown drive. Most notably, Mahomes wasn't touched even once on this drive, not even on a critical 3rd down when the Patriots only sent three rushers to try and pressure him. A big pass to Sammy Watkins despite Stephon Gilmore in coverage put the Chiefs in the red zone. Then the next play was well-designed - Travis Kelce was positioned on the right while Tyreek Hill was stationed to the left of Mahomes. Knowing the Patriots would send their safety to Hill's side of the field, Andy Reid essentially schemed things so that Kelce would only be guarded by one defensive back. It didn't take long for Travis to win his match-up and catch the ball for a touchdown.

One thing that's becoming clear to me as I watch the Chiefs this quarter is that Bob Sutton finally made some adjustments on defense to slow down the Patriots' rushing attack. Sutton now has three of his men lining up as tackles along the middle of the line of the scrimmage. It's much harder for the Patriots to gain any leverage in runs now. However, the additional reinforcement along th edefensive line comes at the expense of the linebackers' corps - instead of fielding two players as conventional linebackers, the Chiefs now only field only one player behind their defensive linemen.

On the last play of the 3rd quarter, Mahomes missed Kelce on what would have been a fairly easy touchdown. To be fair though, his target was open as well, but that throw was significantly more difficult to make. Kelce literally ran across the formation into empty space behind two other receivers running their routes. A simple lob in his direction was all that was needed for a touchdown on that play.

#### 4th Quarter

Watching the 4th quarter, it's clearly becoming evident to me that the Chiefs defensive line is turning into a vulnerability. The problem with the Chiefs is that the line is only capable of two modes - run stopping mode and pass rush mode. When the line tightens up with bigger bodies towards the middle, the Chiefs become effective defensing the run, but the pass rush loses its teeth. When the line widens into a more traditional four-man look and the Chiefs have all their stud defensive linemen out there, Kansas becomes effective rushing the passer, but then the rush defense loses virtually all of its efficacy. 

It's dawning on me that I overrated this Chiefs defensive line. After all, what good is a phenomenal pass rush if the defensive line and the linebackers behind them are completely inept in containing opposing rushers? Therefore, any analysis I conduct in the future on a playoff team's defense has to account for their ability to stop the run with their box players.

By the way, if I haven't mentioned this before, then I'll bring it up here - Sony Michel has played mostly terrific this game. His decision making  and cuts have been on point so far. It appears the rookie is finally realizing some of that first-round potential.

Following the Patriots giving the ball up on downs several minutes into the fourth quarter, the Chiefs had an opportunity to finally gain some momentum. All they needed was a successful drive from their offense that ends in some points. But what we get instead is a three-and-out. A failed run on first down and two poor passes from Mahomes put a quick kibosh on the drive. Really, Mahomes is worrying me here. It's clear as hell that the Patriots were in a Cover-0 formation on 3rd down, but the Chiefs signal caller was awkwardly late throwing the ball to Tyreek Hill. Had he recognized that Hill was in a position to exploit the defense immediately after the snap, he could have actually moved the chains here with a quick sideways pass to Hill.

The Chiefs catch another break, as an errant pass by Brady results in an interception. On the second play, Reid finally dialed up a beautiful play, moving Mahomes to the right only to have him throw the ball against the grain to the left side of the field to a wide open Damien Williams. Running behind three offensive linemen, the rookie rusher sauntered into the end zone.

With the Chiefs now ahead, the opportunity is there to close out the game. And now, **_finally_**, the Chiefs opt to play some good defense. Aggressive press coverage against the Patriots receivers forces Brady to hold on to the ball a touch longer. Unfortunately, the pass rush is unable to hit home. Granted, you have a few players coming close here and there, but Brady still has far too much time in the pocket to breathe comfortably. It's worth noting Chris Jones is sidelined at this point with injury, so the only stud rushers lining up along the line are Justin Houston and Dee Ford. Still, neither one  of these two are slouches, so Kansas shouldn't be having much issue nailing Brady. The problem is that these defenders are being chipped or outright  stone-walled by multiple Patriot blockers. As a result, neither of these edge rushers are unable to even work the pocket until it's too late. The coaches aren't helping much either - neither Houston nor Ford are straying from their wide-nine position. Edge blitzes aren't being called much either.

It also hurts that Tom Brady is playing his best football to close out the game. Without much of a rushing game to carry the offense, the team vested their faith in Brady's arm. And that trust paid off tremendously, as Brady made some key throws to receivers like Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan and Rob Gronkowski to keep the chains moving. Within the red zone, the Patriots were able to count on Sony Michel punching the ball across the goal line on two separate occasions. 

The Chiefs answered back with their own scores and a field goal to tie the game up, but a favorable coin toss put the ball back in Brady's hands in overtime. The rest is history. Overtime does not need to be discussed here.
