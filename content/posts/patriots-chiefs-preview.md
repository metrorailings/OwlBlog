The New England Patriots meet the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium for the AFC Championship game.

![](/uploads/Championship Round Analysis - Patriots @ Chiefs.jpg)The Patriots have underwhelmed this year compared to years past. On the road this season, the team has only managed three wins. And frankly, only one of those victories came against a quality team.

While the Patriots were able to beat the Chiefs in the regular season, that was a home game against Patrick Mahomes early in the year.  Mahomes has gotten better since then. And frankly, it can even be argued that Kansas City was the better team in that contest - if the Chiefs made more of an effort to cut down on the silly mistakes that game, then we'd be talking about a Kansas team with one more victory under its belt this season.

Both teams come into this rematch down a key player on offense. The Chiefs are missing Kareem Hunt coming out of the backfield while the Patriots can no longer count on Josh Gordon catching deep passes. But Kansas City has a promising replacement for Hunt in Damien Williams - the former Dolphin has been racking up some solid numbers over the last several weeks. Meanwhile, New England has yet to find that deep threat capable of replicating Gordon's production. Gronkowski might come the closest to being that player, but age has finally caught up with him this year - the man isn't what he's once been. So if anything, the Chiefs carry the slight edge here in terms of overall offense.

If there's one area where Kansas City can definitively declare an advantage in this match-up, it's on the defensive line. Kansas City has one of the best defensive lines in the league thanks to a trio of elite pass rushers in Chris Jones, Dee Ford, and Justin Houston. So long as the Chiefs' secondary can force Tom Brady to hold the ball just a touch longer, I have faith that their defensive front will be harassing the GOAT on a regular basis. And really, if there's a surefire way to throw great quarterbacks off their game, it's relentless pressure on the quarterback. There's a reason I place so much emphasis on the pass rush when analyzing postseason games. It was the Giants key to success in 2007 and 2011, it was Denver's key to success in 2015, and it'll likely serve the same role for Kansas when they win the Super Bowl this year.

As for coaching, I have nothing but high regards for Bill Belichick. But even Belichick can only do so much with what he's given. Yes, he out-coached the royal hell out of Anthony Lynn last week, but Andy Reid is no Anthony Lynn - the man can adjust on the fly. Belichick needs to concoct a fantastic game plan here should he want to take his Patriots to their third consecutive Super Bowl. But given his team's limitations on both sides of the ball, Belichick will find it damn near impossible to devise a winning plan here. So expect the Patriots' season to end today.
