The New England Patriots meet the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium for the AFC Championship game.

![](/uploads/Championship Round Analysis - Patriots @ Chiefs.jpg)The Patriots have underwhelmed this year compared to years past. On the road this season, the team has only managed three wins. And frankly, only one of those victories came against a quality team.

While the Patriots were able to beat the Chiefs in the regular season, that was a home game against Patrick Mahomes early in the year. Mahomes has gotten better since then. And frankly, it can even be argued that Kansas City was the better team in that contest - if the Chiefs made more of an effort to cut down on the silly mistakes that game, then we'd be talking about a Kansas team with one more victory under its belt this season.

Both teams come into this rematch down a key player on offense. The Chiefs are missing a capable backfield player in Kareem Hunt while the Patriots no longer field a legitimate deep threat in Josh Gordon. But Kansas City has a promising replacement for Hunt in Damien Williams - the former Dolphin has been racking up some solid stats over the last several weeks. Meanwhile, New England has yet to find a deep threat that could replicate Gordon's production. Gronkowski might come the closest to being a viable down-field threat, but age has slowed him down considerably this year. So if anything, the Chiefs carry the slight edge here in terms of overall offense.

If there's one area where Kansas City can definitively declare an advantage in this match-up, it's on the defensive line. Kansas City has one of the best defensive lines in the league thanks to a trio of elite pass rushers in Chris Jones, Dee Ford, and Justin Houston. So long as the Chiefs' secondary can force Tom Brady to hold the ball just a touch longer, I have faith that their defensive front will be harassing the GOAT on a regular basis.

As for coaching, I have nothing but high regards for Bill Belichick. But even Belichick can only do so much with what he's given. Yes, he out-coached the royal hell out of Anthony Lynn last week, but Andy Reid is no Anthony Lynn - the man can adjust on the fly. Belichick needs to concoct a fantastic game plan here should he want to take his Patriots to their third consecutive Super Bowl. And given his team's limitations on both sides of the ball, Belichick will find it damn near impossible to devise a winning plan here. The Patriots' season ends here.
