It's only halftime, but the Patriots are going to win this one. The game was over by the 2-minute warning in the first half.

* The Patriots are once again putting on a coaching clinic here. New England saw Los Angeles' putting smaller bodies out there to defend the flat and decided that these smaller defenders would have trouble handling crushing runs right up the middle.  

    
* Outside of a single batted pass, Ingram and Bosa have been blanked in the first half. It's not easy dealing with the Patriots and their clever use of misdirection and quick passes, but both edge rushers have had opportunities to make their presence known and neither player has taken advantage of those opportunities. I think I've been too generous classifying Bosa as an elite edge rusher. The reality is that he's not the same agent of havoc from last year.  

    
* The Chargers' zone defense is worthless so long as the defensive front cannot muster any pressure. Elite quarterbacks like Brady will sit back and pick apart zone schemes.  

    
* It alarms me that this Los Angeles team that's getting so badly out-coached this game is the same team that dominated against the Ravens last week. It indicates to me that the Ravens sucked more on offense than I thought. Either that or run-first offenses can be easily stunted, especially if you're played that rush-heavy offense earlier in the season.
