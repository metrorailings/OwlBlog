The dynasty team finds its way into the playoffs yet again, this time as the second seed in the American Football Conference.

#### Quarterback: _Tom Brady_

One year removed from being crowned the league MVP, Tom Brady is still very much an elite player. That being said, his play has regressed a bit. His deep ball accuracy percentage sunk downward from 46.5% to 43%. His passing yards per attempt has dropped by about three-tenths of a yard. He's also scored fewer touchdowns this year, opting to throw slightly more interceptions instead.

But the question that needs to be asked here is whether this regression can be attributed to Brady aging or his fellow teammates failing him. And honestly, it's a difficult question to answer. Tom Brady is past retirement age, so he's long overdue for a downfall, but the Patriots skill players are no longer these weapons that can reliably produce. Chris Hogan is no longer the slasher he was the last couple of years. Nor is Rob Gronkowski anywhere close to being a dominant tight end anymore. Brandin Cooks being shipped off to Los Angeles didn't help things either, as the offense lacked a deep receiving threat to start the season. Midway through the year, it seems the Patriots finally found that trusted deep threat in Josh Gordon, but the man's personal demons were too much for the team to handle. So without Gordon, the Patriots are back in the same situation they were in at the beginning of the season.

#### Offensive Weapons: _James White, Julian Edelman_

As the only player to have garnered over 1000 yards from scrimmage this season, James White deserves top billing on this list. The Patriots love their wheel routes and no other halfback on this team runs those routes as smoothly as James White.

Likewise, Julian Edelman deserves to be on this list as well, simply for being Brady's favorite receiver. Brady truly thrives when he has a receiver that can run all sorts of directions from the slot position. Over the years, Edelman and Brady have developed a rapport that no other current receiver on the team can match. That relationship will be critical if the Patriots are to reach the conference championships.

Now...notice Gronk is not on this list?  Well, this year may have been Rob Gronkowski's worst year in football, statistically speaking. For a guy that was averaging over 76 yards a game for the past five years, his 52.5 yards per game this year is shockingly low. Furthermore, scoring only 3 touchdowns over 13 games is not a good stat for a man that was heralded as one of the league's best red zone weapons. It's become clear to many people that Gronkowski is no longer the beast he was in years past, running amok along the middle of the field while undersized defensive backs tried hopelessly to keep him contained. And as a result, he can no longer be counted on as a dependable offensive weapon.

#### Elite Pass Rushers: _Trey Flowers_

For the second year in a row, Trey Flowers has been the team's star at rushing the quarterback. With 20 quarterback hits and 32 solo tackles, Flowers has made his presence known in quite a few games this season.

The only other edge rusher worth consideration here is Deatrich Wise Jr. But numbers alone are sufficient to come to a conclusion here. Last year, the man posted 19 quarterback hits, 5 sacks, and 16 solo tackles. This year, he only notched 16 quarterback hits, 4.5 sacks, and 15 solo tackles. If I did not consider him to be an elite pass rusher last year, why the hell would I consider him one this year when the numbers paint a weaker picture?

#### Playoff Experience

The Patriots roll into the postseason with several new faces, but the major players on the team are all well-versed in playoff football. The only major starters lacking playoff experience are running backs Sony Michel and Cordarrelle Patterson, corner Jason McCourty, and left tackle Trent Brown.

#### Coach: _Bill Belichick (HC), Josh McDaniels (OC)_

The wunderkind Sean McVay is definitely a great coach, if simply for making Jared Goff look like an MVP candidate for a couple weeks. With the right personnel, his offensive schemes produces excellent results. Likewise, Wade Phillips is a fantastic defensive coordinator in his own right. Even if his unit has not been anything worth raving about this year, the man holds distinction as a defensive mastermind. So I trust the Rams are in good hands with these two leading the team.

#### Prognosis / Outlook

In years past, the Patriots were almost always Super Bowl contenders. This year is a different story. With a pedestrian defense and a reduced offense, the Patriots may not even win one playoff game this year.
