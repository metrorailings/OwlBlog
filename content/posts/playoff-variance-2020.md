Our playoff analysis is almost done. The only piece missing is the variance aspect. The scores I calculated in the last post can fluctuate depending on home field advantage, players breaking out into elite form who weren't originally recognized, and teams showing more confidence  than previously expected. So when assessing teams, we need to account for these differentiating factors, as they'll likely tip the scales as these postseason games are played out.
