+++
The 49ers enter the postseason as the top seed. So let's examine their prospects using my trusty old rubric [here](https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/ "Rubric").

***

### Is the team mentally tough?

Unsure. The last three weeks of the season were bizarre. One game was lost to an underwhelming Atlanta team riding the coattails of Julio Jones. The other two games were unnecessarily close. Yes, I acknowledge that key pieces of their defense were sidelined due to injury but it still doesn't sit well with me.

Then again, San Francisco did go on a rough five-week stretch in which they faced off against four playoff teams. While their record for those weeks includes two losses, those losses were hard-fought.

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

No. I still contend that Robert Saleh cannot be considered an elite coach. The team's success on defense comes so much more from talent rather than scheme. In fact, Saleh's approach to defense has been notoriously failing for other teams around the league, whether in Jacksonville or Atlanta or Los Angeles or even Seattle.

On top of that, the Arizona Cardinals managed to ring up points against this defense in two (almost) back-to-back meetings, even though their scheme on offense is pretty obviously configured to favor short passes.

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?

No. Jimmy Garoppalo lacks meaningful playoff experience. Likewise, Deebo Samuel and George Kittle, two of the most valuable skill players, lack postseason experience.

***

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

No. The passing offense on this team has seen some great success courtesy of scheme and raw talent instead of quarterback competence. Credit due to Garoppolo though - he's been excellent in his direction of Kyle Shanahan's system. So was Matt Ryan the year the Falcons went to the Super Bowl with Shanahan at offensive coordinator - Ryan's play was taken to whole another level. I feel the same applies here as well, in that Garoppalo's numbers have been inflated thanks to a system that prides itself on misdirection and unpredictability. While Jimmy has shined in his execution of this system, he hasn't even come close to matching the same success Ryan had running these same concepts.

### Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?

Without a doubt. Kyle Shanahan has whipped this offense into something magical. Only Baltimore has a scarier offense, to be honest.

***

## How many elite pass rushers are on this team?

**_Nick Bosa_** is this team's premiere pass-rusher.

After him, **_Arik Armstead_** presents a strong case here, given his numbers alone. Past the numbers, I've observed Armstead constantly making plays throughout the season, justifying his designation here as an elite pass rusher.

**_Dee Ford_** is potentially another name worth adding to this list, though things remain uncertain given his complicated injury history this season.

***

### How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?

The team's single best weapon on offense is its tight end, **_George Kittle._** George Kittle's numbers alone sell his case as the team's biggest offensive threat. **_Deebo Samuel_** and **_Emmanual Sanders_** are other receivers that can be noted as vectors here, especially the former given his ability to run like Sonic the Hedgehog.

When it comes to their offensive backfield, the 49ers have two additional vectors - the fullback **_Kyle Juszczyk_** and their committee of tailbacks (**_Raheem Mostert / Tevin Coleman / Matt Breida_**). Juszczyk's numbers don't necessarily justify his designation as a vector, but the man's ability to catch the ball out of the backfield is especially valuable for an offense looking to exhaust defenses and their limited coverage resources. 

***

### Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?

Yes, all through the NFC playoffs.

***

### Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?

_Arguably_ yes. Aside from a bad game in which Gould shanked two kicks and had one blocked and another game that was played in some horrific weather, Gould has been pretty good. Maybe I'm making too many excuses for him here, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt given his history.

***

### Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?

Richard Sherman has been one of the best cornerbacks in the league this year, so yes.

## PROGNOSIS

The 49ers are missing the services of a brilliant defensive mind and a quarterback that can play his way out of negative game script. Not to mention their lack of experience will hurt them as well against the Vikings. Even though I've been pretty damn awful at predicting postseason outcomes so far in these write-ups, I'll continue doing so because I'm a dumb fuck - I do think the Vikings will upset the 49ers here.
