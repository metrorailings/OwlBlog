The Buffalo Bills have fought their way into the playoffs for the second time under Sean McDermott. Now let's review them.

***

### Is the team mentally tough?

Yes, the team is mentally tough. They've done enough to demonstrate a will to fight, winning almost all the games they're supposed to win. Their defense has hung in their in tough moments, defending leads against last-minute comeback attempts.

Even against tough opponents, the Bills have played well too. Baltimore and New England had to scratch and claw their way to wins over this Buffalo squad.

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

Yes, the team does feature a great defensive mind in Sean McDermott. This team has lifted itself to the playoffs twice under McDermott thanks to the strength of their defense.

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?

  
Unfortunately not. While most of the starters on offense have considerable playoff experience, this will be Josh Allen's first outing in the postseason. As a mediocre quarterback starting in the playoffs, things won't start well for these Bills.

***

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

No. I would even struggle to say they're led by a viable quarterback. In reality, these Bills are led by an athlete. While Allen can run like a gazelle, he can't throw with any sort of grace or touch.

### Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?

To be determined. Brian Daboll has gotten some productivity out of this offense thanks to his usage of short routes, power runs behind Devin Singletary, Josh Allen's mobility, and good usage of mid-level veterans like John Brown and Cole Beasley. But it's incredibly difficult separating the logic and philosophy driving this offense from Josh Allen's painful throwing.

### How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?

The Bills hit the magic number of 3 here. I can confirm **_John Brown_**, **_Devin Singletary_**, and **_Josh Allen_** as veritable vectors. John Brown is undoubtedly the team's best receiver and the receiver Josh Allen favors most, going by targets. With 2 yards per route run, Brown has validated the team's belief in him. Devin Singletary, meanwhile, has been a great halfback, posting over 5 yards on average with every rush. And Josh Allen is on this list given his mobility - while his passing is suspect, his athleticism and his long runs are truly an asset to the offense.

**_Cole Beasley_** falls outside this bucket here given that his production hasn't quite cemented him as a cornerstone on this offense. He's come up big in spot moments, so it was a little difficult crossing his name off here, but production and dependence matters here when assessing potential vectors.
