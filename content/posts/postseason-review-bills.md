The Buffalo Bills have fought their way into the playoffs for the second time under Sean McDermott. Now let's review them.

***

### Is the team mentally tough?

Yes, the team is mentally tough. They've done enough to demonstrate a will to fight, winning almost all the games they're supposed to win. Their defense has hung in their in tough moments, defending leads against last-minute comeback attempts.

Even against tough opponents, the Bills have played well too. Baltimore and New England had to scratch and claw their way to wins over this Buffalo squad.

The only knock on this team and their defense is their wretched tackling. The Bills have some serious issues stopping players upon first contact.

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

Yes, the team does feature a great defensive mind in Sean McDermott. This team has lifted itself to the playoffs twice under McDermott thanks to the strength of their defense.

***

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?

  
Unfortunately not. While most of the starters on offense have considerable playoff experience, this will be Josh Allen's first outing in the postseason. As a mediocre quarterback starting in the playoffs, things won't start well for these Bills.

***

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

No. I would even struggle to say they're led by a viable quarterback. In reality, these Bills are led by an athlete. While Allen can run like a gazelle, he can't throw with any sort of grace or touch.

### Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?

To be determined. Brian Daboll has gotten some productivity out of this offense thanks to his usage of short routes, power runs behind Devin Singletary, Josh Allen's mobility, and good usage of mid-level veterans like John Brown and Cole Beasley. But it's difficult separating the logic and philosophy driving this offense from Josh Allen's painful throwing.

It seems that when this season started, the Bills were intent on having Josh Allen work with smaller receivers that could run more complicated routes. And it paid off. So if anything, that's an argument that demonstrates the intelligence of the coaching staff here.

### How many elite pass rushers are on this team?

At least one. I can count **_Shaq Lawson_** as an elite pass rusher here. Though not league-leading in any respect, the man still makes plays here and there, even if the numbers don't necessarily vouch for his ability.

**_Jerry Hughes_** is another possibility, given the Patriots seemed intent on doubling him at the line of scrimmage. But that might have been more circumstance than actual strategy on the part of New England.

***

### How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?

The Bills hit the magic number of 3 here. I can confirm **_John Brown_**, **_Devin Singletary_**, and **_Josh Allen_** as veritable vectors. John Brown is undoubtedly the team's best receiver and the receiver Josh Allen favors most, going by targets. With 2 yards per route run, Brown has validated the team's belief in him. Devin Singletary, meanwhile, has been a great halfback, posting over 5 yards on average with every rush. And Josh Allen is on this list given his mobility - while his passing is suspect, his athleticism and his long runs are truly an asset to the offense.

**_Cole Beasley_** falls outside this bucket here given that his production hasn't quite cemented him as a cornerstone on this offense. He's come up big in spot moments, so it was a little difficult crossing his name off here, but production and dependence matters here when assessing potential vectors.

***

### Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?

No.

***

### Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?

No. Stephen Hauschka has missed quite a few field goals this year from 50 yards and out. In fact, he missed 2 important field goals in the Bills 3-point loss to the Browns. A couple other missed field goals were attempted in end-half scenarios, creating doubts about whether he can be clutch should the Bills need a last-minute field goal to win.  

***

### Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?

Tre' Davious White. One of the best cornerbacks in the game. Enough said.

Micah Hyde is another candidate here.

## PROGNOSIS

The Bills have a number of deficiencies, most notably at quarterback and kicker. The lack of playoff experience will hurt Buffalo as well in their first match against the Texans.

Still, there's a possibility the Bills can pull off an upset against Houston in the Wild Card round. If so, their season will end in dismal fashion in Baltimore.
