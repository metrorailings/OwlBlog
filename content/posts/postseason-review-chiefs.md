The Chiefs entered the postseason unexpectedly with a bye. Let's analyze them down using the rubric [here](https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/ "Rubric"), shall we?

***

### Is the team mentally tough?

Maybe? After Mahomes went down with a dislocated knee, the team did pretty well without their star player, taking out the Vikings and putting up one hell of a fight against the Packers.

Then again, it's tough to say. The odd thing about Reid is despite his offensive brilliance, his teams tend to lack that inherent fortitude that's really necessary to survive against tough competition in the playoffs. Too many times has his team been routed unceremoniously or earlier than expected in the postseason. Just from his tenure with the Chiefs alone, he's only won twice in the postseason while losing four times. Three of those losses in particular were pretty embarrassing - one to a Colts team they were leading by 28 points at one point, another to an undermanned Titans team led by Marcus Mariota, and yet another to a Steelers team that scored nothing but field goals. Two of those three losses were at home!

Honestly, if I had to lean one way here, it would be no. Reid doesn't quite have what it takes to build a team that can grit their way through a row of difficult matches.

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

Yes. Spagnuolo has actually done pretty well here. After Bob Sutton was fired, the Chiefs hired Steve Spagnuolo as defensive coordinator to repair what was effectively a broken unit. With a little help, Spagnuolo was able to turn this unit into one of the best defenses in the league in terms of pass coverage. Nothing sums this up better than the fact that blitzing went up by nearly 50% compared to last year, all while keeping the yardage given up per passing attempt pretty low.  

***

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?

Yes, every single starter has significant playoff experience.

***

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

Yes. Mahomes hasn't been the same MVP-caliber quarterback compared to last year, but he's still elite. His deep ball is still arguably the best in the league.

***

### Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?

No doubt here. Andy Reid is a goddamn offensive mastermind, especially with the right talent at offense. The Chiefs certainly have the talent to fully realize Andy's vision of a dynamic offense predicated on pre-snap movement and unusual formations.

***

### How many elite pass rushers are on this team?

Only one player I can definitively assert as an elite pass rusher - **_Chris Jones_**. His numbers are all the more impressive considering he's an interior defensive lineman.

**_Frank Clark_** could prove himself elite during the postseason, but he hasn't done enough during the regular season to fill me with confidence. His numbers are decent, but roughly half of his quarterback hits came against two teams. His numbers turn pedestrian when you take away his games against the Chargers and Broncos. You can't say the same about Chris Jones, on the other hand.

Maybe if the Chiefs are lucky, **_Terrell Suggs_** experiences a rebirth in Kansas City and steps up as the team's second complimentary pass rusher.

***

### How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?

**_Tyreek Hill_** is just dangerous as an all-around receiver.

**_Travis Kelce_** would likely be considered the best tight-end in the league if George Kittle didn't have such a monster year with the 49ers.

Besides those two, things get a little bit more murky here. **_Mecole Hardman_** is another player worth considering here, though his role in the offenses seems more limited to being Tyreek Hill's understudy. **_Sammy Watkins_** started the season strong, but his production has tapered off since, save for some decent games against the Patriots and Titans. **_Damien Williams_** may be the only other player worthy of vector status here, given his penchant for breaking tackles. Injury seems to have slowed him during the regular season though, so let's see if his health concerns persist into the postseason.

***

### Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?

Yes, but likely only during the divisional round.

***

### Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?

Not too sure. Butker missed three field goals, all in games that can be considered close. To his credit, he's been perfect the second half of the season out. 

***

### Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?

Yes, Tyrann Matthieu has been damn good following in Eric Berry's footsteps and then blazing his own path.

***

## PROGNOSIS

The Chiefs have quite a bit of talent and solid coaching. But three critical deficiencies present themselves here - their seeding, the lack of a second outstanding defensive pass rusher, and the lack of resolve. The last drawback is especially concerning, as Andy Reid's teams have been doomed too many times in these playoffs precisely for that reason. Without that mental strength, a team must have complete home field advantage and be stacked in every other major aspect covered here to have a good shot at the Super Bowl.I

In this case though, Kansas is missing a second pass rusher worth his salt as well as total home field advantage. The Chiefs only have slim hopes of winning the AFC title, let alone the championship.
