headline = "Postseason Review - Philadelphia Eagles"

+++
The Eagles have managed to win the NFC East after so much drama. Let's see if they can actually survive a game or two though. We'll evaluate them using the rubric [here](https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/ "Rubric").

***

### Is the team mentally tough?

Yes. It's been painful watching the Eagles this year, but these past few weeks have shown me Philadelphia has demonstrated enough resilience and grit to be considered mentally tough. It takes some fortitude to survive games the past two weeks while so many people on your roster are going down like flies. So I will give them kudos here.

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

Yes. Jim Schwartz has always been one of the better defensive minds in the business. Nothing has changed this year to indicate otherwise. In fact, the team's success this year is more attributable to Schwartz than anybody else this year. Despite injuries wrecking his secondary for a bunch of games and his defensive line underperforming on a few occasions, Schwartz has kept his unit playing at a high level. Constant reorganizations were managed well throughout the season, as depth players were prepared to step up and play serviceably enough in relief duty.

Nothing better demonstrates Schwartz's aptitude than the way the defense played against the Cowboys in the division championship. Yes, Dak was injured somewhat, but the defensive backfield played very well in coverage, batting away balls and keeping the Cowboys receiving threats under wraps for the most part. It was a surprising showing from a unit many people assumed would be the weakest part of their defense. Schwartz deserves credit for training his defensive backs well.

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?

Unfortunately not. While the offensive line has plenty of playoff experience, Carson Wentz and a few of key skill players will be officially playing in their first playoff game. How quick Wentz will be able to calm his nerves will largely determine their final destination in the playoffs.

***

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

It's actually the most difficult question to answer. Wentz has shown his mettle at times, leading at least five drives to outright win games or maintain leads. He should be credited for a game-winning drive against the Falcons as well, but his receiver dropped the ball at a crucial moment unfortunately. 

Still, he's had a number of dull performances. This Eagles offense almost seemed rudderless at times with him at its helm. Even some games that he won were far more harrowing than they needed to be - some of those comebacks shouldn't have been needed in the first place. Injuries and bad coaching have played a role, but the quarterback has to assume some responsibility as well.  His negative expected completion rate isn't doing him any favors.

Because of these doubts, I can't classify him as an elite quarterback.

### Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?

No. While the Eagles can coach up players, I question their play-calling their times. Their commitment to the ground game borders on obstinacy at times, though the rushing attack has won them two games.

What really worries me is that the Eagles possess far more talent on offense than so many other teams and yet I see too many drives stopped short. It doesn't make sense to me, especially with a capable quarterback like Carson Wentz at the helm of the offense.

***

### How many elite pass rushers are on this team?

I honestly don't know. We have three eligible candidates here - **_Derek Barnett_**, **_Fletcher Cox_**, and **_Brandon Graham_**. Neither one have truly stood out consistently enough from my observations. In the key rematch against the Dallas Cowboys, neither of the three were able to mount much pressure, though Derek Barnett may have been playing hurt. Against the Giants in the last week of the regular season, all three had a moment, but I didn't see enough consistency.

Their numbers aren't very impressive as well, though it may be more a function

Still, it's very likely to me that at least one of the three stands out during the postseason. And it's quite possible another of the group will rise up. 

***

### How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?

The Eagles actually have five different vectors on offense.

The most important vectors are the tight ends - **_Zach Ertz_** and  **_Dallas Goedert_**. Both have the ability to run routes and make tough catches. And Carson Wentz seems to have an affinity for his tight ends, given his targeting numbers.

On the receiver end, we have **_Greg Ward_** as a surprise breakout star now that the offense can no longer count on the services of Alshon Jeffery nor DeSean Jackson. On the rushing end, **_Miles Sanders_** has done a fantastic job as a rookie tailback, working in concert with a solid offensive line. His ability to catch the balls out of the backfield also serves this team well.

One more vector here is **_Carson Wentz_**. Though his passing may be shaky at times, his ability to scramble can sustain drives when plays don't develop as expected.

***

### Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?

Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.

***

### Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?

No. Jake Elliott has not been so clutch over the past several weeks, missing four field goals, three of which would have helped to end the game sooner in the Eagles favor.

***

### Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?

Malcolm Jenkins definitely ranks as an elite player.

## PROGNOSIS

The Eagles have their fair share of strengths and weaknesses. If Carson Wentz can play past his inexperience and connect well with his weapons on offense, a division round invitation is in order. And while the Eagles will not be the favorite up against the 49ers, I do believe they'll give San Francisco a run for their money.
