Using the rubric outlined [here](https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/ "Rubric"), it's time for us to start our review of postseason teams with the sixth seed of the NFC, the Minnesota Vikings!

***

### Is the team mentally tough?

No. It's hard for me to say this too, as I always respected Mike Zimmer and the defenses that he trains up. His defenses are usually greater than the sum of their parts. But the offense is nowhere near as resilient as the defense. With the exception of the game against the Dallas Cowboys, the Vikings offense hasn't surpassed expectations, nor have they really mounted any successful comebacks against solid teams.

Minnesota had an opportunity to step up its game against the Packers two weeks ago, but the Vikings were even more flaccid on offense than the Packers. It was depressing to see the team fail to come through on such an important game.

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

Yes, he is. There's no doubt that Mike Zimmer has a solid understanding of good defense.

***

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?

Yes. Most of the starters on offense have some playoff experience. Even though Kirk Cousins only has one meaningful postseason game in his career, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt here.

***

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

No, even though Kirk Cousins has some gaudy numbers. Those numbers came more from a play-action bootleg concept that Kevin Stefanski and Gary Kubiak incorporated into the offense midway through the season. When Kirk Cousins is forced to drop back and play quarterback without any window dressing, the man tends to fall apart.

### Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?

To be determined. As I discussed earlier when explaining why Kirk Cousins is not an elite quarterback, offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski saw some remarkable success when he incorporated a bootleg concept in the offensive playbook, allowing Kirk Cousins to roll out to his left and air out some dimes.

The fact that this team has been pretty productive despite not having an elite quarterback usually stands as proof that the main offensive coaches are doing a great job here, but I wonder if the Vikings' success comes more from talent and easy competition than it does from scheme. Not to mention Minnesota remains firmly committed to the outdated mentality of power running setting everything up.

### How many elite pass rushers are on this team?

_Danielle Hunter (DE)_

The only pass rusher I can wholeheartedly define as elite is **_Danielle Hunter_**. I've seen him step up in big moments and he has the pressure numbers and tackle numbers to justify his inclusion. **_Everson Griffen_** has those numbers as well. But it's different. I have yet to see Griffin truly step up and make plays on a consistent basis. I'll list him here simply as a possible elite pass rusher.

***

### How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?

I can only confirm two vectors here - **_Dalvin Cook_** and **_Stefon Diggs_**. The former remains one of the best tailbacks in this league given his penchant for manufacturing yards despite some poor run blocking from his offensive lineman. Stefon Diggs remains one of the best receiving threats in the league, having posted 2.69 yards per route run, according to Pro Football Focus. 

It seems unfair not to include **_Adam Thielan_** on this list, but his production has plummeted off a click the past several weeks. It remains to be seen whether his injuries continuing plaguing him in the postseason.

Nobody else really qualifies to be on this list, which is a little worrisome. Having only two reliable vectors can leave this offense short-changed against well-coached defenses.

***

### Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?

No.

***

### Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?

Yes. Outside on one bad game early in the season, Dan Bailey has done well scoring field goals and extra points for his Vikings.

***

### Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?

Yes, Harrison Smith has made a name for himself as one of the best swiss-knife safeties in this league.

## Prognosis

This team should be better given its roster. But an injury to a key receiver, a lack of resilience on the part of the offense, and offensive coaching
