Last but not least, the Packers entered the postseason unexpectedly with a bye. Using the rubric [here](https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/ "Rubric"), let's get a sense of this team's prospects.

***

### Is the team mentally tough?

I would say so. Despite the fact that this team has played pretty poorly over the season, the Packers have successfully closed out a number of close games. Even in their losses, Green Bay has shown a willingness to try and claw their way to a quick win. In only one game have the Packers been completely dominated from beginning to end.

Given this is Matt LaFleur's first year as a head coach, it's impossible to go off history here. LaFleur hasn't been particularly inspiring either with his sideline presence, though his honesty is pretty refreshing. But given their  season record in spite of their performance, I'm actually comfortable giving this team the benefit of the doubt.

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

Yes. I'll give credit to Pettine for bringing over free agents that had an immediate impact on defense. I'll also give credit to Pettine for embracing a riskier style of defense that leaves the unit more exposed to rushes. Even though their yardage numbers could be better, the defense has still stepped up when expected.
