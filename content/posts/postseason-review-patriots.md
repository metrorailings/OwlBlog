The Patriots are seeing Wild Card weekend for the first time in over ten years, shockingly. So let's examine their prospects using my trusty old rubric [here](https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/ "Rubric").

***

### Is the team mentally tough?

One would think so going solely off history. But in reality, this team shouldn't have lost the way it did against the Dolphins last week. It was an embarrassing loss against a double-digit underdog.

I'm not sure anymore. The Patriots have lost three of their last five games. Two of those losses came back-to-back. The will to win is there, but the talent and execution is not. Brady, McDaniels, and Belichick have known about this team's offensive issues since the beginning of the season and yet, these three seem almost powerless to overcome their woes.

Still, mental toughness is usually a function of the head coach, and it's impossible for me to doubt Bill Belichick given his pedigree. So I'll give the Patriots the benefit of the doubt here.

***

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

Yes, Bill Belichick is still one of the best at coaching defenses, let alone teams. His defense this year is the gold standard at pass coverage.

***

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?

No doubt.

***

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

Yet another question difficult to answer. Brady has underthrown quite a few passes this year. He's unable to develop any rapport with his young receiving corps this year. Some of the touch on his throws must be lost, as he's not really attempting tight-window throws anymore.

But the mind is still there. The raw football intelligence is still there. It's a quality that never truly leaves the greats, that genius level of knowledge about a particular subject that renders itself indelibly into the recesses of the minds of the greats.

Still...the very fact I have doubt here is enough for me to say no, Brady is no longer an elite quarterback.

### Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?

Yes. Josh McDaniels is one of the better offensive minds in the league today. The Patriots have made hay using scheming and trick plays to put points on the board. Were it not for these plays being so cleverly scripted into the flow of the game, New England's offense would be abysmal instead of just miserable.

### How many elite pass rushers are on this team?

**_Kyle Van Noy_** can definitely be considered an elite pass rusher, given his consistently solid play over the course of the season. While his pass rushing numbers aren't as gaudy as one would expect, we have to keep in mind that Belichick defenses typically ask a great deal more from their pass rushers - Kyle Van Noy saw quite a bit of coverage work as well throughout the season.

And really, if Van Noy is on this list despite the lack of spectacular statistics, then one could make a very strong argument for **_Dont'a Hightower_**.  Hightower was actually more productive on a per-rush basis, tallying up at least 13 quarterback hits despite rushing only half as much as Van Noy.

Somebody could make an argument for **_Jamie Collins_**, but I'll shy away from that, as it's quite clear Bill prefers to use Collins far more in coverage than as an actual pass rusher.

Still, we have two confirmed elite pass rushers and one man that can play like a stud rusher depending on the game plan. The Patriots are in good shape here.

### How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?

On the other hand, the Patriots are not in so good a shape here. **_Julian Edelman_** is clearly a vector given the trust Brady has vested in him, but Edelman's inclusion as a vector is only meaningful so long as he remains healthy _enough_ over the course of the postseason. Injuries have hammered him repeatedly through the season and it seems as if things will be no different for the playoffs.

**_James White_** is the only other player that I can confidently assert as a vector here, given his ability to catch balls out of the backfield.

I have a hard time considering **_Sony "Playstation" Michel_** and **_Rex Burkhead_** a vector here as the Patriots offensive line have been pretty flaccid in their run-blocking. It's worth noting that the Patriots have been much better running the ball the past three weeks, so we can't confidently rule out the ground game as a possible vector.

***

### Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?

Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.

***

### Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?

Surprisingly, yes. Despite their struggles over the season with field goals, it seems the Patriots finally found somebody that can kick them through the uprights consistently. Folk only missed three field goals all year, two in inclement weather and one that was blocked when the Patriots line broke down inside.

***

### Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?

Stephon Gilmore. One could also include Devin McCourty with his five interceptions.

## PROGNOSIS

The Patriots are not nearly as bad as the media narratives claim. Still, their limp offense will cost them dearly on the road in Kansas City.
