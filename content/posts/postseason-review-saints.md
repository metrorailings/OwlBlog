headline = "Postseason Review - New Orleans Saints"

+++
The Saints oddly only the 3rd seed in the NFC due to some unfortunate luck when Drew Brees injured his thumb against the Rams and an underprepared Teddy Bridgewater had to step into his place. Even still, New Orleans has been billed as one of the favorites to win. Let's use the  the rubric [here](https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/ "Rubric") to see exactly why.

***

### Is the team mentally tough?

No doubt. Winning five straight games without Drew Brees alone proves the team can handle hardship. Their comeback win against a surging Titans team in Tennessee is another fine example that exemplifies this team's mental fortitude. 

***

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

Yes. Dennis Allen's tenure as the Saints defensive coach has been largely successful. This year is no different. All three levels of his defense have impressed in one way or another.

***

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?

Yes, these Saints have become fixtures in the playoffs, going three years now with postseason outings. 

***

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

Yes. Brees continues to break passing records in this league. And unlike last year, it doesn't seem like any nagging injury will be sapping him of his talent.

***

### Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?

Yes. Sean Payton's a fantastic coach and an even better offensive mind. His ability to scheme up quick passes for Drew Brees has allowed this offense to consistently move the chains on first and second downs instead of third down.

### How many elite pass rushers are on this team?

I honestly don't know. We have three eligible candidates here - **_Derek Barnett_**, **_Fletcher Cox_**, and **_Brandon Graham_**. Neither one have truly stood out consistently enough from my observations. In the key rematch against the Dallas Cowboys, neither of the three were able to mount much pressure, though Derek Barnett may have been playing hurt. Against the Giants in the last week of the regular season, all three had a moment, but I didn't see enough consistency.

Their numbers aren't very impressive as well, though it may be more

***

### How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?

The Eagles actually have five different vectors on offense.

The most important vectors are the tight ends - **_Zach Ertz_** and  **_Dallas Goedert_**. Both have the ability to run routes and make tough catches. And Carson Wentz seems to have an affinity for his tight ends, given his targeting numbers.

On the receiver end, we have **_Greg Ward_** as a surprise breakout star now that the offense can no longer count on the services of Alshon Jeffery nor DeSean Jackson. On the rushing end, **_Miles Sanders_** has done a fantastic job as a rookie tailback, working in concert with a solid offensive line. His ability to catch the balls out of the backfield also serves this team well.

One more vector here is **_Carson Wentz_**. Though his passing may be shaky at times, his ability to scramble can sustain drives when plays don't develop as expected.

***

### Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?

Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.

***

### Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?

No. Jake Elliott has not been so clutch over the past several weeks, missing four field goals, three of which would have helped to end the game sooner in the Eagles favor.

***

### Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?

Malcolm Jenkins definitely ranks as an elite player.

## PROGNOSIS

The Eagles have their fair share of strengths and weaknesses. If Carson Wentz can play past his inexperience and connect well with his weapons on offense, a division round invitation is in order. And while the Eagles will not be the favorite up against the 49ers, I do believe they'll give San Francisco a run for their money.
