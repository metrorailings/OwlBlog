The Seahawks are returning to the playoffs once again as a wild card team. Let's see if their fortunes will be better this year using my lovely little rubric [here](https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/ "Rubric").

***

### Is the team mentally tough?

Yes. Once again returning to this idea that mental fortitude is primarily a function of the head coach, I'd be remiss to doubt Pete Carroll and the attitude that he instills in his team.

Granted, the team has fallen short on a few occasions or even nearly coughed up the lead in other games, but the Hawks still have that resilience, probably best exemplified by their near-successful comeback against the 49ers in the season finale, despite being so utterly outplayed and out-coached.

***

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

Unfortunately, no. Even though Carroll once led the Legion of Boom early in the decade, his grasp on defensive concepts seems to have slipped over the years.

The Seahawks have coughed up nearly 6000 yards on defense this year. They've won games sloppily against teams that ate up yardage against their defense. Matt Schaub managed to post 460 yards against their defense, albeit in a futile effort as the game was out of hand.

People can argue that Carroll's defenses are more than happy to give up yardage when the Seahawks are blowing out the other team on the scoreboard. Sure, but the Seahawks back in their Legion of Boom days were infamously stingy, even with big leads.

***

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?

Yes. With the exception of a few rookies, most of the Seahawks have considerable playoff experience, including Russell Wilson.

***

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

Yes. Russell Wilson was in the conversation for MVP before Lamar Jackson really broke out as the favorite. Still, he's put in some remarkable performances, including a nearly legendary comeback against the 49ers that fell short due to bad coaching.

***

### Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?

Once again, no. The offense can be unbearably flaccid at times and all too content playing some uninspiring football with the lead in hand. Brian Schottenheimer has done little to field an efficient and creative offense, despite having one of the best quarterbacks in the game heading his offense. Even in their pivotal game against the 49ers, the Seahawks were gutless on offense until the game was essentially forced into Russell Wilson's hands.

***

### How many elite pass rushers are on this team?

None. Jadaveon Clowney may be the one person on this team closest to being considered elite, but his boom-or-bust production over the course of the season only invalidates such a consideration - an elite pass rusher needs to rack up pressures and tackles and be **_consistent_** at it.

Nobody else even comes close.

***

### How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?

**_Tyler Lockett_** and **_D.K. Metcalf_** are the only skill players that can be safely considered reliable vectors on offense, the former known for his speed and route-running ability while the latter is known more as a receiver that can make those contested catches outside the number. Chris Carson would have been on this list had his season not ended due to a hip injury.

**_Russell Wilson_** can add himself to this list as well given his ability to run the ball, either off read-options or scrambles.

***

### Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?

No.

***

### Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?

No. Jason Myers has missed one too many kicks in critical moments for me to certify him as a reliable field goal kicker. Not to mention he's shanked a few extra point attempts.

***

### Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?

No. The Seahawks have one of the worst backfields in the league, as no one player has stood out from those ranks.

***

## PROGNOSIS

The Seahawks have too many deficiencies to go far. With a little bit of luck, Seattle can advance to the division round and possibly lose a closer-than-expected race against the 49ers, but it seems more probable to me that the Hawks will be downed by their fellow birds of prey in the Eagles.
