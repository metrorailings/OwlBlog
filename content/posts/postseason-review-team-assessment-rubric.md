So in assessing these teams and figuring out which teams are more likely to perform well compared to others, I need to come up with some sort of guide that can help me compare these clubs against one another. Yes I know that any one model will fail to grasp all the finer details of the game that motivate the final result, but I do genuinely feel that a great model can be right so much more often than wrong, especially in the playoffs when seasonal data points are pretty much stable at the point. The goal here is to be predict the straight results for at least 8 of the 11 playoff games.

Below, I ask the following questions in **order of importance**.

### Is the team mentally tough?

Quite simply put, has the team showed resilience in adverse situations and still managed to play well?  Usually, this trait can be seen whenever a team has to mount a late-game comeback, especially on the road. But this trait can also manifest itself in the face of serious injury across the roster (think of the 2017 Eagles). 

This mental fortitude usually comes from a strong head coach fostering a culture of teamwork, honesty, and discipline in the locker room.

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

Pretty straightforward why this is important. In today's pass-happy NFL, you need a quality quarterback that can be productive passing the ball, especially when schemes fail to yield easy yardage.

An elite quarterback is defined as a signal-caller that can throw the ball far more accurately than most other quarterbacks in the league and can still be very effective passing the ball without excessive use of schemes or gimmicks. In other words, an elite quarterback is a passer that can actually play dropback football, in which he's improvising throws based off whatever looks the defense gives him. To be effective at dropback football over the course of a season, one usually has to demonstrate an ability to make plays under heavy duress and against tight coverage.

Take the 2018 Rams and their signal caller, Jared Goff. Even though the Rams were the bad boys of the league that year on offense, Jared Goff was not an elite quarterback - the man was a product of McVay's system. Once that system was decoded towards the end of the season, the team saw a major dip in their production as the offense had to rely more on Jared Goff actually dropping back, making reads, and throwing the football accurately. It wasn't a pretty sight, going by the Super Bowl that year.

There's no stat that blissfully sums this up. All the traditional quarterback stats are meaningless, given that we're trying to isolate quarterback performance from offensive production. The only two measures I could find that might be meaningful towards our aim here is the season-wide Expected Completion Percentage provided by Next Gen Stats and QBR, provided by ESPN. Both are limited to some extent though, especially the ladder - ESPN's formula is still something of a black box and has been known to spit out some shady numbers from time to time.
