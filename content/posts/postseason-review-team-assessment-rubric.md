+++
So in assessing these teams and figuring out which teams are more likely to perform well compared to others, I need to come up with some sort of guide that can help me compare these clubs against one another. Yes I know that any one model will fail to grasp all the finer details of the game that motivate the final result, but I do genuinely feel that a great model can be right so much more often than wrong, especially in the playoffs when seasonal data points are pretty much stable at the point. The goal here is to be predict the straight results for at least 8 of the 11 playoff games.

Below, I ask the following questions in **order of importance**.

### Is the team mentally tough?

Quite simply put, has the team showed resilience in adverse situations and still managed to play well?  Usually, this trait can be seen whenever a team has to mount a late-game comeback, especially on the road. But this trait can also manifest itself in the face of serious injury across the roster (think of the 2017 Eagles). 

This mental fortitude usually comes from a strong head coach fostering a culture of teamwork, honesty, and discipline in the locker room.

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

Defenses tend to win championships. And a brilliant defensive mind will take you a long way in the playoffs, as he'll be able to diagnose the concepts that guide opposing offenses and structure his defenses accordingly. Few do this better than Bill Belichick.

A good defense is necessary if I am to designate the defensive coordinator or head coach of that team as a chess player. It sounds stupidly obvious, but it's worth noting nonetheless. After all, a good defensive coach should eventually produce a good defense sometime during the course of the regular season, no? However, the inverse is **_not_** true - a good defense doesn't necessarily need to be led by a good mind. Sometimes, talent is more than enough for a defense to be good. However...talent without intelligence only leads to squandered potential, especially during the playoffs.

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience? 

In other words, I'm talking about playoff jitters here. Sure, jitters quiet down after one game, but for that one game, nerves can determine whether a team succeeds or fails. We've seen this happen time and time again, whether it was the Dallas offense starting horribly slow back in 2016, Philadelphia stumbling in its first postseason game in 2017 before rattling off two sensational wins, the Rams constantly fumbling the ball early against the Falcons in 2017, or the Jaguars embarrassing themselves with an ugly win against the lowly Bills before shredding the Steelers defense in their only postseason appearance over the last several years. 

While the Eagles and Jaguars were able to overcome their nerves to win their respective games, the Rams and Cowboys were sunk into too deep a hole early because of their jitters.

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

Pretty straightforward why this is important. In today's pass-happy NFL, you need a quality quarterback that can be productive passing the ball, especially when schemes fail to yield easy yardage.

An elite quarterback is defined as a signal-caller that can throw the ball far more accurately than most other quarterbacks in the league and can still be very effective passing the ball without excessive use of schemes or gimmicks. In other words, an elite quarterback is a passer that can actually play dropback football, in which he's improvising throws based off whatever looks the defense gives him. To be effective at dropback football over the course of a season, one usually has to demonstrate an ability to make plays under heavy duress and against tight coverage.

Take the 2018 Rams and their signal caller, Jared Goff. Even though the Rams were the bad boys of the league that year on offense, Jared Goff was not an elite quarterback - the man was a product of McVay's system. Once that system was decoded towards the end of the season, the team saw a major dip in their production as the offense had to rely more on Jared Goff actually dropping back in the pocket, making reads, and throwing the football accurately. It wasn't a pretty sight, going by the Super Bowl that year.

There's no stat that blissfully sums this up. All the traditional quarterback stats are meaningless, given that we're trying to isolate quarterback performance from offensive production. The only three measures I could find that might be meaningful towards our aim here is the season-wide Expected Completion Percentage provided by Next Gen Stats, ESPN's proprietary Quarterback Rating, and Pro Football Focus's quarterback grades. The first two are limited to some extent though, especially QBR - ESPN's formula is still something of a black box and has been known to spit out some shady numbers from time to time. Honestly, the gold standard here is probably Pro Football Focus and their play-by-play grading on each and every quarterback.

### Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?

Basically, just copy and paste the same stuff I wrote about teams needing a defensive chess players - does this team feature a great mind on offense, somebody that can scheme up great plays and create easy yardage for their offense? Pair a brilliant mind with an elite quarterback and you have a damn good combination on offense. Josh McDaniels, Frank Reich, and Andy Reid all serve as offensive geniuses on their respective teams.

### How many elite pass rushers are on this team?

I'm still of the belief that the edge rusher is the most important position in football outside of the quarterback, especially during the postseason. More than other positions, it's the edge rushers that sway critical games in their team's favor during the playoffs. It was the Giants and their pass rush that unraveled the seemingly immortal Patriots of 2007. The Giants repeated the same feat in 2011 thanks once again to a dominant pass rush. Hell, it could even be argued that the Patriots of 2018 won their Super Bowl in large part thanks to Trey Flowers and Kyle Van Noy wrecking offensive backfields in playoff games.

A pass rush will never win you the Super Bowl alone. But it certainly helps a great deal, which makes sense - defensive backs and coverage linebackers can only blanket skill players for so long before a receiver finally becomes open. An elite coverage unit is theoretically worthless if opposing quarterbacks can simply sit in the pocket and wait for one of their receivers to finally break free from coverage.

It's not easy to be considered an elite pass rusher though. To get to this point, the defensive rusher needs to be able to generate pressure against opposing quarterbacks on a consistent basis. Quarterback hits are a pretty accurate metric to use here, though we should also review game tape to determine that whether a player simply feasted on weaker competition or actually managed to rack up some hits against more capable offensive linemen and quarterbacks.

Defensive rushers can also showcase their worth through their tackling and their effort. The best pass rushers are usually great tacklers and chasers, keeping opposing rushers from breaking past the line of scrimmage and shutting down screen plays and trick plays before they further develop.
