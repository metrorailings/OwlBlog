The Texans have limped into the playoffs as the fourth seed in the AFC. Let's use the rubric [here](https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/ "Rubric") to see if they can go far in the postseason.

***

### Is the team mentally tough?

Not sure. The Texans have been great at staging late-game comebacks, even on the road. But Houston is such a bipolar team - it seems every good performance is followed by a bad showing. Great showings against the likes of the Chiefs, Patriots, Saints, and Titans have been accompanied by sad displays against the Jaguars, Broncos, Raiders, and Buccaneers.

It seems this team phones in performances whenever they're significant favorites, similar to the championship Giants of 2011. Except those Giants went through a gauntlet of playoff-caliber teams midway through the season that really helped them adjust mentally to a difficult postseason. The Texans haven't gone through a murderer's row of games this season.

Houston did go through some hardships this season when they lost JJ Watt for half the season. While none of its other pass rushers have stepped up in Watt's absence, the Texans defense were able to compensate with some strong performances from the revamped defensive backfield.

I'll say yes here though, going off Bill O'Brien's past history.

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

I'd argue yes. Romeo Crennel's willingness to experiment with the blitz and incorporate cast-offs into his defensive backfield says something about his drive to make this defense better. The defense also had a few stellar games this year, most notably against the Patriots in a big prime-time spot and the Jaguars over in London.

One thing does give me pause here - the way the defense has tanked this year compared to years past. It's just not the same defense - this team has been too happy to give up yardage at times. Then again, maybe Houston can't help itself in this area given the impotence of the pass rush following JJ Watt's chest injury.

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?

Yes, they do.

***

### Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?

Without a doubt. Lamar Jackson aside, Deshaun Watson has been the most electric quarterback this season. The Texans are never out of contention so long as Watson is leading this offense.
