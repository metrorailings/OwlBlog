A resurgent Titans squad led by Ryan Tannehill has muscled their way into the playoffs. Let's look at their playoff prospects using the rubric outlined [here](https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/ "Rubric").

### Is the team mentally tough?

Yes, sufficiently so. After benching their franchise quarterback for a burn-out from Miami, one would be forgiven for thinking the Titans were done for the season. Instead, their fortunes swung upward - the team found renewed life with a quarterback that wasn't afraid to lob the ball into smaller, riskier windows.

Their goal-line stand against the Chargers in Tannehill's first game as a starter, their surprise wins over the Chiefs and Colts, their respectable performances even in defeat...all these things point to a team that's not short on resilience.

### Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?

Hard to say. I respect Mike Vrabel and Dean Pees and the work they've done in their past stints. But it's clear that this Tennessee defense has holes at all three levels. Would things would be worse or better if an average set of coaches were managing the defense? I can't answer.

That being said, this defense has done well enough from a scoring perspective over the past several weeks. Not that scoring defense tells the full story anyway, but it is a feather in their cap nonetheless.

### Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?

A good number of the players on the offense have playoff experience, but unfortunately, the quarterback is missing postseason experience on his resume. Ryan Tannehill's first outing as a playoff quarterback will likely result in a few screw-ups.
