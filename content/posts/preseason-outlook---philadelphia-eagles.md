outlook = "The Eagles are among the most stacked teams in the league. Looking at their defensive line and standout skill players should tell you all you need to know about the sheer number of players that can contribute significantly on this team. Furthermore, their offensive line still ranks as one of the best in the league at pass protection, a boon for their two exceptional quarterbacks.\n\nFree agency saw the team bring in even more potential playmakers at the receiver position and the defensive line, signs that indicate the front office seems well aware that some important pieces of the roster are due for regression, especially after having just won the Super Bowl. An injection of potentially competent talent at those key positions should help mitigate the effects of any performance regression.\n\nOn top of that, Doug Pederson has established himself as one of the best coaches in the league after shepherding his team through the postseason with a backup quarterback at the helm of the offense. It was an impressive feat, especially considering the Eagles had to prove their mettle against one of the best defenses in the league before outdueling the best coach /quarterback duo in NFL history.\n\nIt’s hard to be sour on this team. Even if some elements on this team go through a Super Bowl hangover, this roster is loaded with so much depth that the team could weather some of their players tumbling towards mediocrity. And the coaching should still be up to snuff despite the loss of their offensive coordinator, Frank Reich. After all, it seems to me the fantastic success they saw on offense last season was the product of some phenomenal coaching from Doug Pederson in combination with some excellent quarterbacking from Carson Wentz. It’s not like we’re talking about last year’s Falcons here, who saw their offense regress badly after replacing Kyle Shanahan with a scrub in Steve Sarkisian.\n\nCould this team repeat as champions? It’s a possibility, though it’s worth noting that the team will have to endure a bit of a brutal schedule later this season, something that could cost them home-field advantage in the playoffs. But honestly, if Carson Wentz cannot quite return to elite form a year removed from an ACL tear, the Eagles will be nowhere near as successful as they were last year. Nick Foles is a quality back-up, but ultimately, he is just a back-up."
