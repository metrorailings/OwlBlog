**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the only major change comes with the addition of Chris Foerster, a former assistant coach with the Dolphins who was fired after being caught snorting coke on camera. Apparently, the cokehead has some coaching left in him.

On defense, the 49ers lost a few assistants to Cleveland. New faces have been brought in to oversee the secondary and the pass rush.

Was it not for some overly simplistic defensive scheming courtesy of Robert Saleh, the 49ers would be world champions and I'd be $8000 richer. Ah well...

Anyway, here we are with the 49ers going into the season as the reigning champions of the NFC. Yes, the roster certainly deserves some credit for that accomplishment, but let's face it - the team's success is largely owed to Kyle Shanahan. First off, his serious demeanor and business mindset empowered this team with a sense of discipline and focus that was missing for years before his arrival. But more importantly, his offensive system has pulled some great production from some pretty unremarkable players. Neither Jimmy Garoppolo nor his offensive linemen nor any of the three tailbacks on the roster have the individual talent to excel independent of scheme. None of them deserve the type of contracts awarded to elite players in their respective positions. But in Shanahan's system, these players were generally as productive as their elite-level counterparts. Not the first time something like this has happened under Shanahan - his years with the Falcons led to a Super Bowl berth as well as _Matt Ryan_ being crowned season MVP back in 2016. Let that fact sink in for a minute - _Matt Ryan_ actually won MVP honors one season, thanks to Kyle Shanahan.

Turnover clearly wasn't a concern for the 49ers this offseason. Most of their coaches and their players from last year will be returning. A few key people from last year were lost though, namely Emmanuel Sanders and DeForest Buckner. However, the team spent some valuable draft capital and made some moves in free agency to try to fill the void those two players left behind. So it's possible neither of the two former 49ers will be missed much.

Garoppolo won't be successful this season as he was last season. It's not possible. His tools are too limited. But it's possible that won't matter much so long as the rest of the team pick up where they left off from last season. Expect another solid season from these 49ers as well as a possible Super Bowl berth.
