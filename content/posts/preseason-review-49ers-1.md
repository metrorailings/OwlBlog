_Jimmy Garoppolo_

**KNOWN VECTORS**  
_Matt Breida/Tevin Coleman/Raheem Mostert (RB), Kyle Juszcyzk (FB), George Kittle (TE), Deebo Samuel (WR)_

**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the only major change comes with the addition of Chris Foerster, a former assistant coach with the Dolphins who was fired after being caught snorting coke on camera. Apparently, the cokehead has some coaching left in him.

On defense, the 49ers lost a few assistants to Cleveland. New faces have been brought in to oversee the secondary and the pass rush.

Was it not for some overly simplistic defensive scheming courtesy of Robert Saleh, the 49ers would be world champions and I'd be $8000 richer. Ah well...

Anyway, here we are with the 49ers going into the season as the reigning champion of the NFC.
