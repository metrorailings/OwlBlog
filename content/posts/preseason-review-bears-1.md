**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the team restructured their organization. Schottenheimer will now have two junior coordinators reporting to him, Dave Canales as the passing game coordinator and Brennan Carroll as the run-game coordinator. Interestingly enough, most of the offensive assistance coaches from last year have been retained, just shifted into revised roles.

On defense, the only major change is Damione Lewis coming into the fold as the defensive line coach, replacing Jethro Franklin from last year. It's unclear whether Franklin was actually fired in the offseason, but it's worth noting that last year's defensive front was barely serviceable. So it seems likely the Hawks' brain trust actively sought to bring in a new coach this year to oversee that unit.
