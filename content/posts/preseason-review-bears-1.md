**COACHING TURNOVER**  
After a disastrous season last year, the Bears fired so many of their offensive coaches, including their coordinator. Interestingly enough, Matt Nagy is technically the mastermind of the offense and yet he still remains gainfully employed, which suggests to me that Nagy organized these firings in order to salvage his career in Chicago. Whatever the case though, Chicago has new coaches in place to lead their offense and train their quarterbacks, offensive linemen, and tight ends. One thing worth noting here is that some assistant coaches were hired before Bill Lazor was even formally brought into the fold as the new offensive coordinator. Either Nagy and Lazor were working together before the latter was officially hired or Nagy doesn't care much what his coordinator thinks cause it's his offense.

On defense, things look mostly the same. Technically, the Bears lost a defensive assistant coach to the offense - Chris Jackson switched sides and is now assisting Mike Furrey with the receiving corps.
