**COACHING TURNOVER**  
After a disastrous season last year, the Bears fired so many of their offensive coaches, including their coordinator. And yet, Matt Nagy is the mastermind of the offense and he still remains gainfully employed, which suggests to me that Nagy organized these firings in order to salvage his career in Chicago. Whatever the case though, Chicago has new coaches in place to lead their offense and train their quarterbacks, offensive linemen, and tight ends. One thing worth noting here is that some assistant coaches were hired before Bill Lazor was even formally brought into the fold as the new offensive coordinator. Either Nagy and Lazor were working together before the latter was officially hired or Nagy doesn't care much what his coordinator thinks cause it's his offense.

On defense, things look mostly the same. Technically, the Bears lost a defensive assistant coach to the offense - Chris Jackson switched sides and is now assisting Mike Furrey with the receiving corps.

The Bears were a mess last year. And they'll likely be a mess again this year so long as Moscow Mitch Trubisky remains at the helm of their offense.

Things get interesting when we start looking at Nick Foles though. It's only a matter of time before Mitch is demoted in favor of Foles. But then two questions will dictate the Bears fate here - when is Foles going to take over the offense and will he be anywhere close to Super Bowl form when he makes his starting debut?

In regards to the first question,
