**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On the offensive side of things, the team lost last year's quarterbacks coach to Cleveland. In his place now is Dan Pitcher, his understudy from last year.

On the defensive side, we see two new position coaches in Al Golden and Steve Jackson. Al Golden was brought in to replace last year's linebackers coach, who left to become a college football coordinator. Last year's unit was among the worst in the league, so Golden has his work cut out for him, especially given that the Bengals did little in free agency to fix that unit. Steve Jackson was brought into the fold to replace Daronte Jones, whose contract was not renewed past 2019.

After posting the worst record last year, the Bengals have nowhere to go but up. Joe Burrow brings with him a ray of hope for this team's future prospects.
