**COACHING TURNOVER**  
I’m starting to notice a trend here. Even if a team goes through a coaching overhaul, the new head coach opts to keep certain position coaches. In terms of offense, every single face on that staff is new save for the quarterbacks coach and the wide receivers coach. It is worth noting that an assistant coach has been added to train up quarterbacks. Perhaps management felt two coaches were necessary given that the team now has two rookie passers behind Andy Dalton.

Likewise on the defense, every face is new save for the two coaches responsible for overseeing the secondary.

Not sure what to say about this team. I think McVay fever hit ownership hard here - Mike Brown decided that the Rams quarterback coach was the person best suited to be the next head coach of his team. Granted, Taylor is probably closer to McVay than anybody else on the Rams’ coaching staff, but it still felt like a hiring made out of a fear of missing out on a hot new fad. It wasn’t a hiring necessarily made in the best interest of the team.

Can Zac Taylor rejuvenate the Bengals the way Sean McVay rejuvenated the Rams? Not sure. It takes so much more than observing a great coach in action to be as successful as that coach. Ask all the Belichick assistants that have failed as head coaches themselves. One cannot simply emulate a coach’s winning style - it takes a certain level of emotional and raw intelligence to lead a winning organization. So if anything, the odds are stacked against Taylor here.

On top of that, AJ Green being injured leaves them with question marks at the wide receiver position. Outside of Green, the only other receiver that has proven his worth is Tyler Boyd. Boyd alone cannot carry the passing attack. For this team to be successful throwing the football, AJ Green and Tyler Eifert need to come back to the field sooner rather than later and stay healthy. Although perhaps if somebody else steps up, that would afford Cincinnati some leeway with the injury bug.

On defense, the team features solid talent along the frontlines, but nowhere else. The secondary is void of any truly noteworthy players. The only name worth mentioning is Dre Kirkpatrick for his veteran experience and his long history with the team. It’s possible that new defensive coordinator Lou Anaramo could work some magic here in the backfield though, given his experience training up journeymen defensive backs. I actually think he did good work last year with the Giants, though unlike Cincinnati, New York did have a few star defensive backs playing for them.

Honestly, it’s very hard to get a beat on this team given that the main coaches have almost no history as coordinators. The only thing that’s evident is that Zac Taylor will be bringing Sean McVay’s modified Shanahan system to the Bengals. Whether Cincinnati can adopt such a system rests on Taylor’s coaching. For all the reasons listed above, I doubt the Bengals will improve much from last year, if at all.
