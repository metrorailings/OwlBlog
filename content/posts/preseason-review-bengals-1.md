**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On the offensive side of things, the team lost last year's quarterbacks coach to Cleveland. In his place now is Dan Pitcher, his understudy from last year.

On the defensive side, we see two new position coaches in Al Golden and Steve Jackson. Al Golden was brought in to replace last year's linebackers coach, who left to go become a college football coordinator. Last year's unit was among the worst in the league, so Golden has his work cut out for him, especially given that the Bengals did little in free agency to fix that unit. Steve Jackson was brought into the fold to replace Daronte Jones, whose contract was not renewed past 2019.

After posting the worst record last year, the Bengals have nowhere to go but up. But to be fair, we shouldn't be setting the bar so low for this team, for these Bengals finally have some reason for hope in Joe Burrow. Burrow is an all-world talent. If he realizes his potential as an elite quarterback, this team will finally climb the ranks as a contender worth noticing over the next several years.

But we need to restrict our analysis to this year. This year alone, things look a bit bleak. Rookie quarterbacks need more practice and hands-on coaching than any other player in the league, but this coronavirus has put a serious damper on that. It's very possible Joe Burrow might not even really connect with any of his receivers until the season officially starts. So expect this Bengals offense to be sloppy for the better part of the season.

Things aren't much better for the defense. Despite featuring some quality talent, Lou Anaramo's unit was among the worst in the league. Maybe the second-year coordinator can turn things around this season, but I'll believe that when I see it. Also worth noting - his linebacking situation still remains atrocious. His linebacker corps consists of only rookies and journeyman.

I'm not expecting much from this team this season. The Bengals still have some work left to do if they want to be taken seriously.
