**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense and defense, I noticed a few junior assistants have been reassigned or have had their titles clarified.

The only major change came with the coach overseeing the defensive line leaving voluntarily to return to college football. That resignation prompted Sean McDermott to reach out to a former colleague from his Carolina days to come and coach the defensive linemen.
