**KNOWN VECTORS**  
Nick Chubb (RB), Odell Beckham (WR), Jarvis Landry (WR), David Njoku (TE), Austin Hooper (TE)  
  
**NOTABLE DEFENSIVE PLAYERS**

**MANAGERS**

**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, only the running game coordinator managed to survive the regime change. It makes sense, given Nick Chubb's fantastic season last year.

On defense, all the assistants from last year have been replaced, following the arrival of Joe Woods as the team's new defensive coordinator.
