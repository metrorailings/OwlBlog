**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense and defense, I noticed a few junior assistants have been reassigned or have had their titles clarified.

The only major change came with the coach overseeing the defensive line leaving voluntarily to return to college football. That resignation prompted Sean McDermott to reach out to a former colleague from his Carolina days to come and coach the defensive linemen this year.

Buffalo is the very definition of a team that performs far better than the sum of its parts. Sean McDermott and Brandon Beane need to be commended for building a team that's surpassed expectations time and time again. 

The Bills have a bit of a precarious situation along the front lines of their defense. With Lorenzo Alexander retiring, Shaq Lawson signing over in Miami, and Jordan Phillips leaving for the desert, that defensive front was left completely bereft of any noteworthy players. McDermott and Beane responded quickly by spending some serious coin during free agency to poach Mario Addison and Vernon Butler away from Carolina's locker room. It remains to be seen whether both players will pan out. Neither one impress me much at first glance.

Another acquisition worth noting is that of Josh Norman. Norman's best days actually came under McDermott's guidance, so it'll be interesting to see whether Sean can breathe life back into the former Pro Bowl corner and have him playing again at a high level. Given his age though, he'll more than likely serve the team as a depth player.

Really though, all these points are fairly minor compared to the one real weakness that's been dragging this team down for the past two years - Josh Allen. Simply put, Allen can't throw deep. His accuracy can best be summed up as rancid ass. All right, that's not a fully fair representation of his accuracy - his short and intermediate passes are usually money. But no passing game can really sustain itself on those short throws. It's the deep ball that really gives the air game any bite. If the Bills can't incorporate that dimension into their offense, then Buffalo can only hope to win the championship on the backs of a historic defense. 

Yet a quick look at the players I marked as notable defensive players should give anybody pause on that point. A great defense is only possible with enough talent on the roster. Buffalo doesn't have the requisite amount of high-level talent on that side of the football, period.

With that said, a playoff berth is a possibility, given the coaching, the consistency of personnel from last season, and the fact that the Patriots defense will be nowhere near as dominant this year as last year.
