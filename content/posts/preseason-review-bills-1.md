**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense and defense, I noticed a few junior assistants have been reassigned or have had their titles clarified.

The only major change came with the coach overseeing the defensive line leaving voluntarily to return to college football. That resignation prompted Sean McDermott to reach out to a former colleague from his Carolina days to come and coach the defensive linemen this year.

The Bills have a bit of a precarious situation along the front lines of their defense. With Lorenzo Alexander having retired, Shaq Lawson signing over in Miami, and Jordan Phillips leaving for the desert, that defensive front was completely bereft of any noteworthy players. In response to the talent exodus, McDermott and Beane spent quite a bit of coin to poach Mario Addison and Vernon Butler from Carolina's locker room. It remains to be seen whether both players pan out.

Another acquisition worth noting is that of Josh Norman. Norman's best days actually came under McDermott's guidance, so it'll be interesting to see whether Sean can breathe life back into the former Pro Bowl corner and have him playing at a high level. Given his age though, he'll more than likely serve the team as a depth player.
