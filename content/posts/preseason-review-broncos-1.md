**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Rich Scangarello was quickly ousted as offensive coordinator following a pretty sad showing from the offensive unit last year. Former Giants head coach Pat Shurmur has been brought in to replace him. Shurmur also brought along his former offensive coordinator in Mike Shula to take over as quarterbacks coach.

The defense lost a linebackers coach to the Los Angeles Rams. In his place is John Pagano, recently fired from Houston after a disappointing season from his outside linebackers over there.

On paper, this Broncos team should be better than last year's squad. Drew Lock maturing into his second year, Von Miller no longer being the sole anchor along that defensive front now with Bradley Chubb returning from injury and Jurrell Casey joining the fray, young promising talent ready to step up as reliable skill position players...all these facts point to an upsurge here.

Yet, I can't shake this feeling that Vic Fangio doesn't quite get it. The friction between him and his offensive staff last year didn't quite rub me right. It's one thing for a coach to privately chastise his offensive coaches. It's a whole another thing to outright berate them in the midst of a game. Then again, Scangarello's flaccid play-calling deserved to be derided. Victory favors the bold in the professional leagues - an offense built on conservative decisions won't be going far.

Pat Shurmur was very clearly hired to hone Drew Lock into a franchise-caliber quarterback. His reputation as a quarterback whisperer was built from working with the likes of Donovan McNabb, Nick Foles, and Case Keenum. It's clear Shurmur's better than most other coaches at developing quarterbacks. So it's easy to buy into this argument that Drew Lock should elevate his level of play going into this new season.
