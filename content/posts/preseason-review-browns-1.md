**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, only the running game coordinator managed to survive the regime change. It makes sense, given Nick Chubb's fantastic season last year.

On defense, all the assistants from last year have been replaced, following the arrival of Joe Woods as the team's new defensive coordinator.

First thing I notice when studying this team is that the organization committed itself to fixing its offensive line this season. Signing Jack Conklin in free agency and drafting a tackle in the first round were both much-needed investments after last year's disastrous experiment at left tackle.

Second thing I noticed is that Haslem and his inner circle were truly committed to a complete overhaul of management. Only one assistant coach from last year survived the regime change - all other faces along the coaching ranks come into Cleveland as fresh faces. It was a much-needed change too. Freddie Kitchens lacked the organizational and team-building skills a professional head coach needs to win respect and instill a winning culture. Largely because of his deficiencies, his team lacked discipline, unity, attention to detail, and a willingness to change until it was too late. Todd Monken wasn't doing the team many favors too, forcing the offense to adopt too many air raid principles at the expense of playbook creativity and flexibility.

And on that point, the reality is that Baker cannot operate within a conventional spread-style offense. Maybe it's his inability to really see the field past the line of scrimmage, maybe it's his struggles to read defensive formations and anticipate open windows...I'm not sure. But Baker performs much better running plays thematically designed to keep defenses guessing.   Gadget plays, bootlegs, two tight-end sets....these plays bring the best out of Mayfield.
