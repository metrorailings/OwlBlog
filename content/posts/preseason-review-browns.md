**Coaching Turnover:**

A new head coach brings quite a few new faces to the coaching staff. Todd Monken will now serve as the offensive coordinator. Interestingly enough, the running backs coach from last year, Ryan Lindley, has been retained as the quarterbacks coach for this year. I suppose it makes sense given that Lindley is a former quarterback. Anyway..the wide receivers coach has been retained for the same role as well. Otherwise, all the other people on the offensive coaching staff came with the new regime.

On defense, we see a bigger transformation. Save for the secondaries coach, the defensive coaching staff there has been completely revamped, with former head coach Steve Wilks now in charge as defensive coordinator.

How quickly things (or rather, perceptions) change. The Browns went from being considered league fodder under Hue Jackson to now being hyped as Super Bowl contenders. And it’s hard not to be excited for the Browns. A talented quarterback entering his sophomore year _should_ take some strides forward, especially with a receiving corps headlined by the likes of Odell Beckham and Jarvis Landry. The defense should improve as well now that Olivier Vernon will be joining Myles Garrett in the trenches - so long as the offense keeps the team playing from ahead, those two should have plenty of opportunity to hunt down opposing quarterbacks.

Even though he’s a rookie coach, Freddie Kitchens is seen as something of a tested commodity, having some success working with Baker Mayfield last year after Todd Haley was fired. After all, there’s a reason the Browns opted to promote Kitchens to head coach over the veteran Gregg Williams.

That being said, we must throw some cold water on the team’s championship prospects here. An entirely new coaching staff brings change...and change is something that takes time for players to absorb and handle. Furthermore, it remains to be seen as to whether Kitchens is ready for the stresses of being the lead coach. And honestly, there is reason to cast doubt. The team has been sensationalized in the media ever since Dorsey managed to poach Odell Beckham from the Giants. Instead of tamping down expectations and reminding the team that nothing great has been achieved as of yet, the coaches and management seem (more or less) content letting the spotlight rot this team’s collective psyche. Odell Beckham being a prima donna will not make things any easier for Kitchens - if the team goes into a slump, Odell will start chirping. In fact, his diva behavior has already been an issue this season when he opted to skip OTAs against his new head coach’s wishes.

The sportsbooks have upped the Browns’ win total to 9.5 this season, off the hype that followed the trade for Odell. It’s a very rosy outlook for a team buying too quickly into narratives about their greatness. I see the Browns ending this season with a last-minute push for the postseason that ends up falling just short.
