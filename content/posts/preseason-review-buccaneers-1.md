**COACHING TURNOVER  
**On offense, the staff has been completely retained. But let's be real - Byron Leftwich is no longer the offensive coordinator. That title now belongs to Tom Brady.

On defense, nothing has changed.

Coaching continuity is a lovely determinant of success in the National Football League. Players operate at a higher level when the organizational framework under which they operate doesn't change much through the offseason.  This continuity factor alone should be a huge boon in a year when practice schedules and teaching sessions have been significantly reduced. But then again...Tom Brady and his ego coming into town introduces a new dynamic that may upset that equilibrium.

Bruce Arians and Tom Brady make for one strange marriage. One wants to heave the ball deep as much as possible. The other prefers moving the ball methodically down the field with controlled passes to receivers running lateral routes. Both men stand at odds against one another - whether this marriage works depends on the level of compromise we see from the two of them. It helps that the Buccaneers are absolutely stacked in terms of offensive weaponry. Still, that luxury comes at the cost of an offensive line that struggles in pass protection. Weapons matter little if Brady's not allowed to take a breath or two in the pocket. It's an issue Brady's never seriously handled in his career, so it's going to take some time to work through this. 

Forget offensive philosophy for a minute though. Just remember that Tom Brady is 42 years old going only into his second team. For all intents and purposes, he's institutionalized. It'll be incredibly difficult for him to adjust anywhere else outside of the Patriots bubble. No other organization runs as smoothly as the one in New England. Their culture and their methodical way of thinking has never been seen elsewhere. For Brady to gamble on himself and his own brand like this smacks of hubris. I do expect Arians to give him quite a bit of leeway when it comes to the offensive playbook, but only so much can be done to give Brady comfort. The biggest point of concern for Tampa Bay will be how much time Brady will need to _truly_ settle in. It could be a few weeks. A month. Two months. Or possibly a whole season.

Defensively, this team remains just as interesting. The Buccaneers feature up to four potentially dominant defensive linemen, a real luxury almost never enjoyed in today's NFL. Tampa Bay can become a real destructive force on defense should three of those four be able to ball out at a high level, like what we saw from last year's 49ers.

That pass rush plays a more important role given the state of their secondary. The lack of playmakers in that part of the field bit them in the ass quite a bit last season. The hope this year is that the three defensive backs drafted last year and the safety drafted this year elevate that entire unit to something that no longer resembles a liability.  If those young players do pan out, Tampa Bay will have a complete defense at all three levels. Last year's squad ranked fifth in DVOA, so a more complete defense should make this unit truly elite.

Tampa Bay has some great potential this year. A trip to the postseason is definitely possible here, so long as Brady and Arians can keep this offense humming through the better part of the season.
