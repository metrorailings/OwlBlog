**Staff Turnover:**

The entire offensive coaching staff has been revamped under new head coach, Bruce Arians. Arians sweeps in with an entirely new coaching staff, starting with Byron Leftwich as the offensive coordinator and Todd Bowles at defensive coordinator, followed by a whole slew of fresh position coaches working underneath them.

Last year, I correctly billed this team as a bottom-feeder. Jameis Winston disappointed, as expected. The defense didn’t live up to its potential as well, resulting in Mike Smith getting canned midseason.

This year though...I do expect a bit of a renaissance for Tampa Bay. Sure, the team lost some talent on both sides of the ball - linebacker Kwon Alexander, wide receiver Adam Humphries, and star defensive tackle Gerald McCoy are no longer with the team. But the team’s potential here stems from its solid coaching staff and the surprise factor involved with the arrival of a new coaching regime. I have faith in Bruce Arians being able to correct Jameis and most of his bad habits. I have faith in Todd Bowles conjuring up a defense that’s greater than the sum of its parts. Maybe best of all, I have faith in the history between Arians and much of his coaching staff. There’s a reason why Arians refused to come out of retirement unless he was able to bring many of his former associates with him to Tampa. The rapport that many of the new coaches have with one another (and more importantly, with Arians) will help speed the regime transition along.

It’s worth noting that Jameis Winston is so much more likely to thrive under Arians. If there’s one thing both men love, it’s the deep ball. After all, Winston’s recklessness with the football stems from his pathological love of big plays. Even though Dirk Koetter labored to turn Jameis into a more traditional quarterback with structured reads, it didn’t work - his eyes would always trend towards receivers running deeper routes. But Bruce Arian offenses are known for their religious devotion to the big pass play. So unlike most other coaches, Arians would actually encourage Jameis to embrace his risky tendencies and throw the ball deep. In other words, we may end up seeing a surprisingly strong marriage between these two.

I actually think the Buccaneers can get more than six wins this season. In fact, the Buccaneers have an outside shot at winning the division outright. Honestly, I’d be so much more confident declaring Tampa Bay a solid team if this defense wasn’t so woefully lacking in talent. But if younger players like Vita Vea finally step up this year, then this defense may be serviceable.
