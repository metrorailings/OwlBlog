**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, nothing significant has changed. Almost everybody from last year's staff has been retained.

On defense, the only major change comes with the defensive line coach from last year being replaced with Brentson Buckner. Buckner's last stint in Oakland didn't end well, but I do respect his blunt acceptance of his tenure there - he openly admits to getting fired from there. None of that "it wasn't the right fit for me" bullshit.
