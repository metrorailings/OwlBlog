**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, nothing significant has changed. Almost everybody from last year's staff has been retained.

On defense, the only major change comes with the defensive line coach from last year being replaced with Brentson Buckner. Buckner's last stint in Oakland didn't end well, but I do respect his blunt acceptance of his tenure there - he openly admits to getting fired from there. None of that "it wasn't the right fit for me" bullshit.

Arizona surprised me last year. I fully expected Kliff Kingsbury to predicate the entire offense on the air raid philosophy. Instead, Kingsbury took a more balanced approach, opting to rely on the ground game on roughly 40% of offensive plays. It's likely elements of the air raid were weaved into the playbook, but the team's identity on offense resembled a much more traditional spread offense than the air raid.
