**-STAFF TURNOVER-**

On the offensive side, we have no significant turnover. Mike Groh was added to the staff as a wide receivers coach. Last year's wide receivers coach has been re-assigned as a passing game specialist.

On the defensive side of the ball, everybody was retained except for Mike Phair, the defensive line coach. Phair voluntarily left the team to go join old friends over in Carolina. In his place is Brian Baker.

As expected, the Colts fell a little short of the playoffs last year, mostly because Jacoby Brissett couldn't step up as a starting quarterback. Interestingly enough, the Colts were mostly solid on so many other points, especially on offensive line. But those strengths weren't enough to overcome their deficiency at quarterback.

This year is a brand new year, though. Philip Rivers has now been hired to command this offense from behind center. Unlike Brissett, Rivers is a proven franchise quarterback. Indianapolis can trust him to make their passing game competent once more, even if Philip's age may have started catching up to him. Watching a few of his plays from last year, I know the arm strength and the intellect is still there.

On the defensive side, the addition of DeForest Buckner gives this defense  a true cornerstone player that can dominate the line of scrimmage. Last year, the only player on this squad worth his salt at rushing the passer was Justin Houston, who could only play spot duty. Buckner though is a down-to-down player, so the Colts should always be able to field a dominant pass rusher on the field so long as the two remain healthy.

Oddly enough, the Colts opted to leave Pierre Desir out on the streets this year, instead bringing in Xavier Rhodes to fill his roster spot. It remains to be seen whether Rhodes is an adequate replacement given his shit play from last year. Maybe a change of scenery could do him good? If Rhodes can at least regress back to average form and Rock Ya-Sin (last year's first round pick) can take the next step in his development, this Indy defense will be complete at all three levels.

So in the end, we have a few major factors of uncertainty here that keeps me from crowning this team as championship contenders. Despite these unknowns though, I still feel good calling these Colts as an elite team given that they have one of the best coaching staffs in the league. In Reich I trust.
