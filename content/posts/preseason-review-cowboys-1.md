**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Only offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, defensive line coach Leon Lett, and position coach Doug Nussmeier survived the transition from the Jason Garrett era to the Mike McCarthy era. Every other coach will mark their first year with the Dallas Cowboys this season.

The Cowboys start fresh with a new coaching regime. Unfortunately, this coronavirus situation will stunt the gelling process that needs to take place whenever a new coaching staff is introduced to an existing roster. 

Yet I still have them billed as a top-tier team. A large part of the reason why is the quality of their roster - with the exception of a few position groups, all facets of their roster feature quality talent. Quarterbacks, halfbacks, wide receivers, linemen, linebackers...this team's loaded with them. Only their secondary and tight end positions lack real depth.

The Cowboys success this year depends on whether the coaches and players can sync up. And I do believe that can happen. McCarthy has retained Kellen Moore for good reason - last year's offense was ranked as one of the most proficient in the league. McCarthy seems perfectly intent keeping Moore's system in place, though few revisions will likely be made to introduce more west-coast style concepts into the playbook.

The defense will have a harder time adjusting though. Mike Nolan prefers a 3-4 defense over a 4-3 one. The Cowboys have been running a traditional 4-3 defense under Marinelli for the past several years, so a change that drastic will not be easy. Nolan will need to integrate some sort of hybrid approach here as a compromise. Either way, historic record suggests elite defensive ends haven't slowed down in any of his defenses, so expect DeMarcus Laurence and Everson Griffen to have a beautiful season together.

Speaking of which, the Cowboys landing Griffen is _huge_. Super Bowls are won off the backs of pass rushers. A organization must have at least two pass rushers worth their salt should they want to be taken seriously as Super Bowl contenders. And with the acquisition of Griffen and Gerald McCoy, Dallas should be able to muster a highly capable pass rush here.

Only major point of concern is their defensive backfield. With the departure of Byron Jones, Dallas lost a major cornerstone in that secondary. The hope here is that Darian Thompson, Ha-Ha Clinton Dix, or Chidobe Awuzie will step up their game and keep the unit playing at a serviceable level. 

Given the balance across that roster and the fact that new coaches can spark some life in teams that have fallen into a rut, I really like this Dallas squad. I can see a Super Bowl berth.
