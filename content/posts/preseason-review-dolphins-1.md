**COACHING TURNOVER**  
The team blew up their offensive coaching staff after only one season under Brian Flores' tenure as head coach. Not sure why, as Chad O'Shea wasn't given much workable talent in the first place. Chan Gailey comes into the organization as the new offensive coordinator this year. Only the coaches training the halfbacks and the tight ends were carried over from last year.

Likewise, the defense went through a reshuffling of its own. Flores replaced last year's coordinator with a friendly face in Josh Boyer, who was a colleague from his days in New England. Most of the assistant defensive coaches from last year were retained as well. Four new coaches were hired to mentor the linebackers and defensive backs.

I'm a little concerned at all the coaching changes in the offseason. Major organizational revisions don't usually follow a season where the team exceeds expectations. Maybe this shake-up will ultimately produce an even better team, but the whole thing just seems so bizarre to me, especially considering some assistant coaches held on to their jobs despite the coordinators getting fired.

Tua Tagovailoa is another point of concern for me. Given his injury history, he may be too brittle for this league. And on top of that, it's been years since he's seen meaningful action on a football field. Combine that with shortened practices this season and don't be surprised if Tua suffers through some rough outings his first year in the professional leagues.

Then again, quarterbacks like Robert Griffin, Andrew Luck, and Lamar Jackson managed to thrive in their first years in the NFL. If I had to reason why these players manage to perform well in their rookie season, I'd chalk it up largely to two things - dynamism and charisma. Quarterbacks possessing those two qualities are simply better fit to negotiate their way through negative game script. See, the psychological toll of negative game script can be particularly taxing on rookie passers - to marshal an offense is hard enough as is, but once momentum starts swinging hard against you and it seems as if your team is failing at every level, it becomes especially grueling. Metaphorically, it's like paddling against whitewater rapids. Quarterbacks with charisma and athletic ability are better able to will their team out of these depressions quicker compared to other players. And I do believe Tua Tagovailoa has those qualities in spades, even if he's rusty.

The defense has seen some massive upgrades this season thanks to free agency. Every level of the defense now features a proven player.  A pretty jarring contrast to last season, when Flores and Grier seemed more than happy to shed off any promising talent on the roster in order to build up draft capital and salary cap.

The Dolphins seem like they'll be taking things much more seriously this year. What worries me about this shift in mentality is that the coaches may try to inject Tua into the game plan earlier than necessary. Maybe Tua will carry this team to the next level, if only for a year or two. Maybe he'll break down after a few hard hits. I'm not sure. It's hard to gauge this team's prospects.
