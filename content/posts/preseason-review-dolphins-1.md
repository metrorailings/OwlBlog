\**COACHING TURNOVER  
\**The team blew up their offensive coaching staff after only one season under Brian Flores' tenure as head coach. Not sure why, as Chad O'Shea wasn't given much talent to work with. Chan Gailey comes into the organization as the new offensive coordinator this year.

I'm a little concerned at the coaching changes in the offseason. Major organizational changes don't usually follow a season where the team exceeds expectations. Maybe this shake-up will ultimately produce an even better team, but the whole thing just seems so bizarre to me, especially when considering some assistant coaches held on to their jobs even as their superiors ended up getting canned.

Tua Tagovailoa is another point of concern for me. He may be too brittle for this league. And on top of that, it's been years since he's seen action on a football field. Combine that with the lack of practice this year
