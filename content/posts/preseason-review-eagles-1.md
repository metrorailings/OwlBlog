**COACHING TURNOVER**  
After a rather flaccid season last year, Mike Groh and his wide receivers coach was fired. While a replacement was found to train up the wide receivers, it seems Doug Pederson decided to assume coordinator duties himself, though he'll have quite a bit of help from his quarterbacks coach. Aside from those changes, the team added a few noteworthy names as assistants/consultants - Rich Scangarello and Marty Mornhinweg. My hunch tells me both men will have significant input over the playbook.

On defense, we see a bit of reorganization as well as a new face in Marquand Manuel. Manuel was brought in to coach the defensive backs after last year's coach voluntarily left the team to go become a coordinator in Detroit. Also noteworthy, an assistant from last year was promoted to replace last year's defensive line coach after the latter mutually parted ways with the team.
