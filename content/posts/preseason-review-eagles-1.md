**COACHING TURNOVER**  
After a rather flaccid season last year, Mike Groh and his wide receivers coach was fired. While a replacement was found to train up the wide receivers, it seems Doug Pederson decided to assume coordinator duties himself, though he'll have quite a bit of help from his quarterbacks coach. Aside from those changes, the team added a few noteworthy names as assistants/consultants - Rich Scangarello and Marty Mornhinweg. My hunch tells me both men will have significant input over the playbook.

On defense, we see a bit of reorganization as well as a new face in Marquand Manuel. Manuel was brought in to coach the defensive backs after last year's coach left the team to go become a coordinator in Detroit. Also worth noting, an assistant from last year was promoted to replace last year's defensive line coach after the latter mutually parted ways with the team.

The Eagles are a case study in chronic injury. Football hasn't officially started yet and the team is down multiple key players. Their starting left guard is out for the season, leaving a patchwork offensive line in an even more precarious situation. Alshon Jeffery and their first-round draft pick Jalen Reagor are dealing with their own spate of injuries, which means the team will once again rely on depth receivers to play significant snaps. On top of that, you have a quarterback prone to injury leading this beat-up offense.

The theme for this season will likely be "wasted talent". Philadelphia is studded with so much talent along the trenches, particularly along their defensive line. But that luxury comes at the expense of an injury-laden receiving corps and a young inexperienced defensive backfield. Sure, Darius Slay gives Philly the veteran shutdown corner they were so clearly missing last year, but I'd say that's not enough to make up for the loss of Malcolm Jenkins. Jenkins was so much more than just a highly capable player - he was a captain who commanded respect on and off the field. Without him, expect the secondary to struggle without any real veteran leadership to offer direction.

The coaching and the spotty talent is good enough to notch several wins. Just not good enough to go to the playoffs.
