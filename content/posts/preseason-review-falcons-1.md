**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the only major change was a new tight ends coach coming into the organization after Mike Mularkey retired.

On defense, just about the whole staff has been shaken up from last year. Some assistants have been retained, but reassigned into different (usually more specific) roles. Other assistants have been replaced by new faces or junior assistants from last year. Clearly, Dan Quinn was convinced another set of changes were due this offseason. One more thing worth noting is that Bob Sutton was brought on as an advisor.

The Falcons are an interesting bunch. They always feel like a team that falls below expectations too many times. Last year was yet another mediocre chapter in the organization's history.

This year brings some new hope. For one thing, Atlanta splurged a bit in free agency, notably in an attempt to bolster their defensive front and add some muscle along their offensive backfield. Sure, they lost their starting corner, a flexible piece of their offensive line, and a Pro Bowl tight end, but otherwise, the Falcons did well. Speaking of which, the loss of Austin Hooper wasn't taken lightly, as the team doled out some draft capital to acquire Hayden Hurst from the Ravens, the hope being that Hurst can fill in admirably for the Pro Bowler. Neither was the loss of Desmond Trufant taken lightly as well - Dimitroff spent a first-round draft pick to acquire a cornerback that will be starting for them as soon as this season, apparently.  The rookie will likely go through some serious growing pains prior to developing into a capable defensive back. 

Still, Atlanta's biggest problem has been its tendency to underperform by its own standards. Their only great year came courtesy of Kyle Shanahan and his brilliant scheming - all other years ultimately yielded nothing but dashed hopes. Perhaps part of that can be attributed to the fact that since Shanahan, the Falcons offense has been left entirely in the care of coordinators who can't pull together an offense greater than the sum of its parts. Or perhaps it's partly because Dan Quinn is an overrated defensive mind who lucked into his job by riding the coattails of a historic Seahawks defensive unit. All his years in Atlanta, Quinn has failed to give the city a  top-tier defense capable of wreaking havoc. Why should this year be any different? All the changes he made on the defensive coaching staff may produce some positive results, but the future prospects of the defense ultimately depend on his decisions. Unless Quinn changes his philosophy and approach considerably this season, I don't expect Atlanta's defense to be feared much this year.

With a pretty easy schedule, the Falcons may be able to profit from enough lucky plays to earn a wild card ticket to the playoffs. Any higher expectations are foolish.
