**Staff Turnover:**

The turnover here is complicated.

Dirk Koetter was brought in to take charge of the offense after the higher powers in Atlanta fired Steve Sarkisian following his shaky mismanagement of the offense last year. The quarterbacks coach, the offensive line coach, and the wide receivers coach from last year were retained, though the receivers coach will now be training running backs instead this year. Oversight responsibilities for the wide receivers will now fall into the hands of assistant head coach Raheem Morris. The assistants and tight ends coach from last year were replaced with new personnel this year. It’s worth noting that former Titans head coach Mike Mularkey will now be training up the tight ends.

On defense, Marquand Manuel was ousted after a disappointing year managing Atlanta’s defense. Instead, Dan Quinn will now be handling coordinator duties directly. Most of the staff from last year was retained, with the only major change coming with defensive line coach Bryant Young being swapped out for Jess Simpson. Interestingly enough, the team brought Bob Sutton over from Kansas City to serve as a senior assistant on defense.

It’s hard to get a beat on these Falcons. It’s clear the offense and defense were off last year. The changes to the coaching staff on both sides of the ball this year are a testament to that. And interestingly enough, Atlanta hired a familiar face to coach the offense - Dirk Koetter. The last time Koetter was there, the team only posted six wins to ten losses. Not all of those losses fall on his shoulders however - to his credit, Julio Jones and Matt Ryan were both selected to the Pro Bowl that year, though it’s hard to say whether the former even needs a coach.

Last year made it clear the Falcons feature some solid talent on offense, despite Steve Sarkisian’s schemes constantly putting his skill players in disadvantageous positions. First-round rookie Calvin Ridley showed some promise as a big-play threat. Meanwhile, Matt Ryan finally found a reliable tight-end in Pro Bowler Austin Hooper. And Julio remained as dominant as ever, racking up enough yards to be crowned the league’s receiving champion. The offensive line **_may_** have been a point of weakness last year though, which may explain why the team restocked the line this year with fresh faces, signing veteran guards during the offseason and then spending two first-round draft picks on college linemen. So if Koetter can learn from his predecessor’s mistakes and not hamstring his skill players, the Falcons can have one of the best offenses in the league this year, especially if that run game plays as big a role as it did the year the Falcons went to the Super Bowl.

On defense, their undoing last year were injuries and an underwhelming defensive line. Without cornerstone players like Deion Jones and Keanu Neal and lacking a pass rush with any teeth, opposing offenses didn’t have to work hard to mow down that defense. This year, Dan Quinn himself will be calling the plays on defense. On top of that, a new coach will be training up the players lining up along the defensive front. Will those two changes (along with a little bit of injury luck) be enough to turn things around this year? Maybe. At the very least, I see a slight uptick in their performance given how bad they were last year. A defensive-minded head coach should be able to fix a few deficiencies on a defense that ranked among the dregs of the league.

I actually see the team doing far better than it did last year. That being said, the team will struggle to break into the double-digit win territory this year - the Falcons reside in the hardest division in the NFC. Furthermore, Atlanta will be facing off against the Vikings, Eagles, Rams, and Seahawks. A winning record is certainly possible though, so long as Atlanta plays at a high level for most of the season and has a little luck avoiding injuries.
