**COACHING TURNOVER**  
After spending all season last year among the dregs of the league, Gettleman decided to burn everything down and start all over with Joe Judge as the new head coach. The wide receivers coach and the junior offensive line assistant from last year were the only folks to survive the transition of power.

Ah, my Giants. How I miss having high expectations for them going into a new season...

This season should be a lost cause, unfortunately. The coronavirus pandemic and the shortened training camp schedule means it'll take longer for the coaches to indoctrinate the players with their style of football. A particularly troublesome fact given Daniel Jones is entering only his second year as the foreman of the offense. Unless he immediately clicks with whatever playbook Jason Garrett drafts for him, it'll be a good minute before the sophomore quarterback settles comfortably with the new offense.

The good news is that the Giants feature a whole assortment of talented skill players, particularly among their receiving corps. If Jason Garrett can instill some complex schemes into his offensive packages to take advantage of all his offensive playmakers, the end result can be an offense that runs amuck against opposing defenses. But Garrett's history with the Cowboys gives me some room for doubt. I can only hope that Garrett can forget about his clapping days and reinvent himself in a new city.

On defense, things are more problematic. New York spent considerable money in free agency to sign Blake Martinez, James Bradberry, and Leonard Williams, the hope being all three can become foundational pieces of the team. I'm not sure I trust Gettleman's judgement at all for eyeing talent without bias...after all, it's pretty clear Williams and Bradberry were players that he loved, not necessarily players that he think could fit well with the new coaching regime.

That brings me to the biggest issue dragging this team down - Gettleman and his old-school approach to team-building. Gettleman wants to operate in a world in which a general manager has free rein to draft players of his choosing without much input from coaches. His coaches would have no choice but to incorporate those players into their framework somehow. That style of roster construction is no longer tenable. Things have advanced. Speaking of which, technology and data has become so much more important in assessing players today. The fact that Gettleman is only now boarding that train stands as yet more proof to his old-world mindset.

New York will not recognize any of their potential until next year though. Honestly, six wins to me seems a bit of a stretch. It's certainly possible with a little luck though.
