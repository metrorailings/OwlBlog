**Coaching Turnover:**

The Giants have kept their whole offensive coaching staff from last year.

On defense, only about half the coaches have been retained. The assistant linebackers coach and the two defensive backs coaches have been replaced this year, likely in an attempt to improve the lagging passing defense in a league predisposed to airing the ball out.

It’ll actually be interesting to see how the Giants do this year. Despite Dave Gettleman’s criminal mismanagement of this organization, the roster still features some considerable talent. Pat Shurmur has kept many of his coaches from last year too, so nothing much changes from a schematic standpoint - players should have an easier time settling into their groove this year.

Unfortunately, the Giants have a major problem at quarterback - Eli Manning. The man is a danger to this team. His unwillingness to throw the ball any further than ten yards severely limits the team’s potential on offense. And in today’s NFL, a team that cannot effectively air the ball out is doomed to failure. Listen, I love Eli and I’ll always cherish him for bringing two Super Bowl rings to the team. 2011 was the year I fell in love with football, and it was all because Eli single-handedly dragged these Giants to the championship that season. It was a season that forever cemented his legacy as a Giant great. But all great men fall victim to father time sooner or later - Manning is no different. His era has passed. It’s time for Daniel Jones to succeed him as the franchise quarterback.

That being said, it’ll take time for Jones to adjust to life in the NFL. Rookie quarterbacks almost never see immediate success their first year in the league. And according to the experts, Jones is still rough around the edges coming out of college - if so, then expect the man to take a year or two making quite a few mistakes as he hones his talents.

It also doesn’t help that the team is absolutely gutless at the pass rush. After dealing Olivier Vernon to the Browns, Gettleman has left this team completely bare along the edges of the defensive line. The hope here is that Lorenzo Carter and Markus Golden can serviceably fill in that void, what with the former having a full year of experience under his belt and the latter having thrived before under James Bettcher back when Bettcher was the defensive coordinator for the Cardinals. But we’ll need to wait and see whether this plan pans out.

You know what though...if there is one good thing to be said about New York’s defensive front, it’s that the Giants are fielding some big bodies along the trenches. B.J. Hill, Dalvin Tomlinson, and Dexter Lawrence lend some serious size to that defensive line, and that’ll be key at stopping opposing rushers from running buck wild up the middle.

The Giants are still rebuilding. That defense will need roughly two to three years to regain top form now that most of their major players from recent years past have been shipped out or unsigned. And that’s fine, as Daniel Jones will need a few seasons to sharpen his skills as a passer. It’s possible the team could pull as many as six wins this season, but expect nothing more than that.
