**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Obviously, the biggest change at offense comes at the coordinator position. With the sunset of the Nick Foles era, John DeFillippo has been let go in favor of Washington's former head coach Jay Gruden. Interestingly enough, the vast majority of offensive assistant coaches from last year have been held over during this transition. Last year's quarterbacks coach Scott Milanovich bailed after securing a head coaching position in the Canadian Football League, so he's been replaced with Ben McAdoo, arguably the worst coach in Giants history.

On defense, the only significant change came with the team replacing the junior linebackers coach.
