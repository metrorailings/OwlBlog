**COACHING TURNOVER**  
Obviously, the biggest change at offense comes at the coordinator position. With the sun setting on the Nick Foles era in Jacksonville, John DeFillippo has been let go in favor of Washington's former head coach Jay Gruden. Interestingly enough, the vast majority of offensive assistant coaches from last year have been held over during this transition. Only last year's quarterbacks coach Scott Milanovich managed to bail after securing a head coaching position in the Canadian Football League, so he's been replaced with Ben McAdoo, arguably the worst coach in Giants history.

On defense, the only significant change came with the team replacing the junior linebackers coach.

Are the Jaguars tanking for Trevor Lawrence? Good question. It's hard to argue that Jacksonville's not in a rebuilding mode. I mean...three of their best defensive players have been traded away for draft selections. Nick Foles has been unceremoniously shipped away after the Jaguars shelled out some serious coin for him a year before. The team's perfectly content keeping sixth-round sophomore player Gardner Minshew in place as the starting quarterback and giving him little in terms of weaponry. The team made no splashy moves in free agency.
