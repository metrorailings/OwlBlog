**Staff Turnover:**

On the offensive side, quite a few of the assistant coaches from last year were retained, despite the hiring of a new offensive coordinator in John DeFillippo. Only offensive line coach Pat Flaherty and running backs coach Tyrone Wheatley were let go. While I don’t have much of an opinion on the latter, I can say that firing Pat Flaherty is likely a good move. Flaherty has been lousy at training up offensive linemen since his days with the New York Giants. Jacksonville’s ragged offensive line last year is yet another blemish on his resume.

On the defensive side, Perry Fewell was released from his duties overseeing the secondary in favor of a two-man coaching set-up. Furthermore, Dom Capers joins the staff as an advisor to Mark Wash.

How wrong and right I was last year…

I was (pretty obviously) right in that Blake Bortles could torpedo this team’s Super Bowl hopes. But I was devastatingly wrong as to how low the Jaguars would sink if the Bortles train were derailed. Once Bortles lost whatever little confidence he had following a humiliating performance in Arrowhead, the rest of the team collectively gave up on the season. The defensive backs soon lost their swagger while the defensive linemen lost their cool. The locker room environment quickly became toxic, as defensive players were fighting one another and some of the offensive players were stewing angrily over their quarterback situation.

Anyway, the powers that be in Jacksonville eventually reached a hard conclusion - that the promised land would always be out of reach so long as a simpleton like Bortles continued helming their offense. So Bortles was let go and a four-year contract was dealt out to Nick Foles to replace him. Any hopes of the Jaguars making the postseason rests on the shoulders of the former Super Bowl MVP.

So can the Jaguars fight their way back to respectability this season? Sure, they can. Will they though? A few variables stand in the way of a solid prediction here. The biggest variable is whether John DeFillippo and Nick Foles could gel together. While DeFillippo worked well with Foles two years ago during Philadelphia’s championship run, he was only a quarterbacks coach then. It still remains to be seen whether DeFillippo is able to coach a competent offense as a coordinator. His last stint in that same role ended with him getting fired mid-season. A firing that was made all the more curious given that the Vikings have one of the best coaching staffs in the league.

Another major variable is whether Doug Marrone and Tom Coughlin can reinstill a sense of discipline in a team that lost its religion last year. And signs seem to indicate that the two men are doing a fine job so far at wrangling this team’s chaotic impulses. Nothing best exemplifies this then the way the team handled the contract situations for Myles Jack and Yannick Ngakoue. One of those two men actually showed up to all team activities and participated without complaining about ongoing contract negotiations. The other man did the opposite, protesting his contract situation by refusing to participate in any preseason team activities. The Jaguars management did the right thing and rewarded the team player while stalling contract talks with the player holding out. Decisions like that go a long way to building a culture that prizes teamwork and unity, the exact two things the Jaguars were missing last year.

Given that the Colts no longer have a franchise quarterback and the Texans are making stupid decisions in pursuit of some superficial show of championship potential, the Jaguars have a very real chance of winning this division outright. Much of that will depend on whether Foles can flourish under DeFillippo. So here’s hoping that DeFillippo can go back to his days in Philadelphia and find plays that bring the best out of his quarterback.
