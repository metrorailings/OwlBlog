**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the team replaced one junior assistant with another.

On defense, the biggest change came with last year's junior secondary getting replaced by a former cornerback turned coach.

The one theme that defined the Jets this offseason was offensive linemen. Not only did the Jets use a first-round pick on an offensive lineman, but general manager Joe Douglas spent a pretty penny signing some premium linemen during free agency.

Other than that, the team will be back in pretty much the same form as last year. However, they'll be missing a critical playmaker in Robby Anderson. And that loss will hurt - the offense is sorely lacking skill players that can help Sam Darnold matriculate the ball downfield.

A weak offense isn't doing that pathetic defense any favors either. Jamal Adams, a strong safety, was the team's best pass rusher last year. Pretty strange for a defensive back to outdo the trench players at one of their core competencies. In all fairness though, it seems the Jets defensive line sold themselves out to stop the run  - New York did finish last year as one of the two best teams at defensing against the run.
