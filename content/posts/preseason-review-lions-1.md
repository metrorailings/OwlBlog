**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the only position group to have a new coach this year are the tight ends.

On defense, the changes are more drastic. Paul Pasqualoni will no longer be overseeing that unit, having voluntarily left the organization to "be closer to his family." The linebackers and cornerbacks coaches were fired unceremoniously at the end of last season. New hires were brought in to replace Pasqualoni and the old linebackers coach while a junior assistant from last year will now be mentoring the secondary.

Detroit starts the best quarterback in the division and yet oddsmakers still see them as the worst team in the NFC North. It takes quite a bit of tomfuckery to achieve that honor. Of course, Matt Patricia is one of those few coaches in the league that can sink a team to that level.

I feel dirty talking about this team. Matt Patricia being such a terrible coach is a major reason why. Instead of spinning his own culture there with the Lions, he's trying hard to recreate the Patriots' ecosystem inside Detroit . Except his attempts to emulate the Patriot way are so inauthentic. The culture in New England works simply because it genuinely reflects the mindset of the man that runs the organization, warts and all. Matt Patricia can try his best to copy the culture as much as possible, but his attempts are stupidly superficial - the players there clearly aren't buying his message.

Speaking of stealing things from the Patriots, one of the Lions' biggest free-agency hauls was (of course) a player that was on New England's roster last year - Jamie Collins. The other two major players the Lions pulled in the offseason are Desmond Trufont and Hallipoulivaati Vaitai. The latter is famous for getting his quarterbacks killed soon after being inserted into the lineup. Why the Lions doled out a five-year contract for his services is beyond me.

Still, the bigger question remains whether their defense has taken a step forward. From a statistical viewpoint, the answer is likely yes. Don't expect any big leap though - their potential is capped given the limited talent on their roster as well as the undeserved ego of their head coach.

And I suppose that brings me back to the biggest question dogging this team - can an elite quarterback overcome an awful coach? That's hard to say. I would think an overbearing coach would quash any promise a great quarterback would show. But then you look at teams like the Texans and you see Deshaun Watson thriving despite Bill O'Brien's incompetence. And unlike Matt Patricia, O'Brien has full control of his offense. At least in Detroit, Stafford and Bevell enjoy some degree of freedom given Patricia specializes in defense.

It's quite possible that Detroit can end up in the playoffs largely thanks to Stafford. It would be one hell of a surprise.
