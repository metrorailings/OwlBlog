Detroit starts the best quarterback in the division and yet oddsmakers still see them as the worst team in the NFC North. It takes quite a bit of tomfuckery to achieve that honor. Of course, Matt Patricia is one of those few coaches in the league that can sink a team to that level.

I feel dirty talking about this team. Matt Patricia being such a terrible coach is a major reason why. Instead of spinning his own culture there with the Lions, he's trying hard to recreate the Patriots' ecosystem inside Detroit . Except his attempts to emulate the Patriot way are so inauthentic. The culture in New England works simply because it genuinely reflects the mindset of the man that runs the organization, warts and all. Matt Patricia can try his best to copy the culture as much as possible, but his attempts are stupidly superficial - the players there clearly aren't buying his message.

Speaking of stealing things from the Patriots, a couple of the Lions' biggest free-agency hauls were (of course) players that played on New England last year - Jamie Collins and Danny Amendola. The other two major players the Lions pulled in the offseason are Desmond Trufont and Hallipoulivaati Vaitai. The latter is famous for getting his quarterbacks killed soon after being inserted into the lineup. Why the Lions doled out a five-year contract for his services is beyond me.
