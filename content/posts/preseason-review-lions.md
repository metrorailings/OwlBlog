Despite hiring a new offensive coordinator to helm the offense, the Lions didn’t flip much at the position group level, only replacing the coaches overseeing the quarterbacks and running backs.

On defense, things have remained mostly intact from last year.

Last year was a disappointment. Matt Patricia came in and took a very eccentric approach to the way he conducted things as a head coach, even going as far as telling a beat reporter to sit up straight at a press conference. And now this year, the man is proud to have his team straight up touted as the Detroit Patriots, given all the things he’s done to emulate the Patriots’ approach to football and team-building. Apparently, Patricia doesn’t understand that emulating a winning formula is not enough to actually build a winning team. Every organization must foster their own culture and develop their own way of doing things in order to succeed. It’s fine to borrow elements from other organizations, but to cop another team’s style entirely smacks of naivete.

Besides that, Matt Patricia also gambled on the run game last year, opting to make his Lions a run-first team. It wasn’t a prudent decision. Detroit bottomed out of the division in his first year as a head coach. In his defense, one could argue that the Lions lack the raw talent necessary to engineer a dominant rushing attack. But does that even matter? In today’s game, it should be obvious that the air game is so much more valuable compared to the run game. So prioritizing the latter at the expense of the former once again smacks of naivete.

This year, the Lions may see a bit more life on offense under new offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell, but let’s not forget Bevell was run out of Seattle for good reason. Bevell had a strange playbook that mixed good and bad concepts in equal parts. That inconsistency makes failure a very real possibility here. The defense doesn’t seem much better, though it’s worth noting that since scooping up Mike Daniels, the Lions now feature one of the league’s heavier defensive fronts. That should bode well against other teams that need to rush the ball to open up the offense.

All things said, I have a hard time finding positive things worth mentioning about this team. Matt Patricia may be a good coordinator, but his actions as a head coach leaves me baffled. I cannot be high on a team when its head coach perplexes me. Expect a losing season here. It’s very possible for the team to end up as a bottom feeder as well.
