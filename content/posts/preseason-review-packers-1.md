**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the only significant change was a new coach being hired this year to oversee wide receivers after last year's coach was fired for training a sorry bunch of receivers outside of Davante Adams.

On defense, an assistant coach from Minnesota's staff has been poached to come in and mentor the secondary.
