**Coaching Turnover:**

On offense, only the running backs coach from last year managed to survive the Packers’ transition away from the Mike McCarthy era.

On defense, even though Mike Pettine was retained as the defensive coordinator, most of the assistants underneath him have been flipped. Only the defensive line coach and the secondaries coach have been kept from last year. Interestingly enough, none of the defensive coaches have been designated as run game or pass game coordinators - it seems the end of the McCarthy era means no more defensive sub-coordinators to complicate the coaching structure.

Note that the Packers are favored to end the season on a winning record. I find that fascinating.

On one hand, it’s not that difficult to make a great case for the Packers doing well this year. Aaron Rodgers is still one of the best quarterbacks in the game, injuries be damned. The defensive roster this year better reflects Mike Pettine’s vision of an ideal defense. Matt LaFleur’s approach to offensive football is refreshingly different from that of Mike McCarthy’s.

But on the other hand, pessimists can make the argument that all these coaching, philosophical, and personnel changes are too much for any team to grasp in the matter of a few months - in other words, it’ll take time for these Packers to bond with one another, let alone adopt a new style of offense that’s significantly different from the offense they’ve been running over the last several years under McCarthy.

The pessimist argument rings truer to me then the optimist’s outlook. Sure, I’m more inclined towards arguments that sow doubt over hope...but the reality is that the Packers have made so many dramatic changes heading into this season. All these new parts that were brought into the fold this year need some time to settle into place. So expect a slow start followed by steady improvement. A postseason berth is not completely impossible here, but it’s going to require some serious misfortune befalling on their division rivals and the emergence of a second wide receiver that can complement Davante Adams.
