**COACHING TURNOVER**  
A new regime begets plenty of new faces. On offense, every coach comes into the organization new this year save for one Jake Peetz. The running backs coach from last year will now be training up the quarterback.

On defense, it seems like every coach is fresh this year.

It's worth noting that Michael Lombardi's son is on the coaching staff as a quarterbacks assistant, so Lombardi may have plenty more insight into this team than your average beat reporter. So if he starts making picks in games involving the Panthers, pay close attention.
