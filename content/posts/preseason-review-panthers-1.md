**COACHING TURNOVER**  
A new regime begets plenty of new faces. On offense, every coach comes into the organization new this year save for one Jake Peetz. The running backs coach from last year will now be training up the quarterback.

On defense, it seems like every coach is fresh this year.

The Panthers will be an interesting team to watch, what with this being the first year of Matt Rhule's tenure. He comes with high hopes that he can make Carolina relevant once more as a football powerhouse after a sharp fall from grace following their Super Bowl defeat back in 2016.

Not much can be expected this year though. The coronavirus set back practice schedules, making it harder for Rhule and his assistants to spread their gospel to the players. On top of that, the team needs more talent, particularly along the back end of their defense. The secondary will likely be a major point of weakness going into this season, especially if Eli Apple is that unit's chief cornerback.

I do think a chance is there the Panthers can shock us with some wins this season against quality teams. Carolina has that surprise factor in its favor - nobody around the league really knows what to expect from Rhule or his offensive coordinator Joe Brady, given both are making their NFL debut at their respective positions. Brady does come fresh off winning the college championship as the engineer of a very exciting LSU offense, so I wouldn't be surprised to see him weave quite a few creative concepts into his playbook.

It's worth noting that Michael Lombardi's son is on the coaching staff as a quarterbacks assistant, so Lombardi may have plenty more insight into this team than your average beat reporter. So if he starts making picks in games involving the Panthers, pay close attention.
