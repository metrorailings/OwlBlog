**COACHING TURNOVER**  
The offense is a bit of a strange mess. All the coaches from last year are returning except for the retired Dante Scarnecchia. It seems like most of those coaches have been reassigned to other position groups. Not sure if this is an intentional move by Belichick to cross-train his assistants. Or perhaps Bill simply reorganized his staff in order to better accommodate his new hires. Whatever the reason, we now have three new coaches in place on the offensive staff.

The defense went through the same reorganization as well. All the coaches from last year have been retained, save for the defensive line coach Bret Bielema. Bielema skipped over to the Giants in order to judge former Patriot coordinator Joe Judge. Staff assistants from last year were reassigned to different positions this year, perhaps for cross-training purposes. Belichick also added another of his sons to oversee the safeties.

The trajectory of this Patriots team will be interesting to watch.

On defense, expect some serious regression to the mean here. That dominant New England defense of yesteryear grew fat playing nothing but bad teams in six of their first eight games. A reputation built by feasting on bottom-feeders won't hold up against a much tougher schedule this year. More importantly though, many of the players that defined that defense have moved on or opted out of the season - D'onta Hightower, Patrick Chung, Kyle Van Noy, Jamie Collins, Danny Shelton, and Duron Harmon will be missed from New England's defensive ranks this season. This many critical soldiers missing in action cannot be good for any outfit, let alone the Patriots defense.

On offense though, things should be much better compared to last year. The bitter truth of last season was that Tom Brady was terrible. Maybe age finally caught up to him, but it's also pretty damn clear Brady wanted no part of the offense the Patriot coaches wanted to run. He failed to build rapport with any skill player not named Julian Edelman or James White. He'd pass up open receivers to force passes towards the few players he actually trusted. It was an ugly turn downward for him, and his move to Tampa Bay makes so much more sense in this light.

This year though, Belichick will be working with a former MVP in Cam Newton. And Cam is especially hungry this year, looking for some sort of redemption after being unceremoniously ousted from the Panthers. Unlike Tom, Bill has a truly dynamic figure in Cam - his mobility and athletic build should give Josh McDaniels plenty more material to load into his playbook. On top of that, Cam should be more willing to work with skill players who couldn't develop a bond with Brady. Not to mention Cam is much more willing to throw the ball outside the numbers.

So long as the offense can outpace the expected defensive regression, New England should be the favorite to take the division yet again. A long playoff trip is probably unlikely though.
