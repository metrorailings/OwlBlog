**STAFF TURNOVER**  
The one major change here comes with Rod Marinelli now overseeing the defensive line. Marinelli's great work in Dallas bodes well for Las Vegas here, as the Raiders were one of the worst teams at pressuring the passer. Not one defensive player last year really staked a name for himself as a marquis pass rusher.

Three. That's the total number of touchdowns these Raiders scored during the third quarter _in all 16 games last season_ - 3 touchdowns. Last year's Raiders were so bad, that not one player on that team was invited to the Pro Bowl. Think about that - the team with the most deluded fanbase in the league couldn't even manage to send one of their own to Hawaii.

Gruden is heralded as some offensive genius, yet his offense seeing the end zone only three times coming out of halftime last year tells me otherwise. It seems to me that teams managed to figure Jon's game plan out after a few quarters. Normally, great coaches would adjust accordingly in order to keep opposing defenses guessing, but Gruden seemed incapable of that. Pretty worrying for the man tasked with helping the Raiders relive their old days of glory.

It's not even a difficult game plan to figure out. It's a power rushing attack combined with short passes. The offense only saw success on a given drive so long as the vast majority of plays netted positive yards. Should Oakland fall behind schedule, the drive was essentially doomed.

It's not just the poor game planning either. His personnel decisions has been horrific. And his quarterback situation still remains a bit of a train wreck. Neither Derek Carr nor Marcus Mariota give Gruden the type of quarterback he wants - one with juice.

On defense, things still remain questionable. I'm not sure if any of their free agency pick-ups or their draft selections from this year (or last) are ready to step up. Nobody in Paul Guenther's unit really impressed last year heading into their second year under his system. The third year can be that magic year, but it seems ridiculous to me that players would need three years in a system to finally blossom. 

I don't feel good at all about this Raiders organization. I don't think they're trending in the right direction quite yet. And the coronavirus will only frustrate them more as they get used to their new venue in Vegas. I'm projecting a bottom-feeder here.
