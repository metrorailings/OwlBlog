21 points. That's the total number of points these Raiders scored during the third quarter _in all 16 games last season_ - 21 points. Last year's Raiders were so bad, that not one player on that team was invited to the Pro Bowl. Think about that - the team with the most deluded fanbase in the league couldn't even manage to send one of their own to Hawaii. 

Gruden is heralded as some offensive genius, yet his offense kept stalling coming out of halftime last year. It seems to me that teams managed to figure Jon's game plan out after a few quarters. Normally, great coaches would adjust accordingly in order to keep opposing defenses guessing, but Gruden seemed incapable of that. Pretty worrying for the man tasked with helping the Raiders relive their old days of glory.

It's not just the poor game planning either. His personnel decisions has been horrific. And his quarterback situation still remains a bit of a train wreck. Neither Derek Carr nor Marcus Mariota give Gruden the type of quarterback he wants - one with juice.
