**STAFF TURNOVER**  
Aside from the running backs coach, the offensive coaching staff has been kept intact from last year. It's worth noting that this team has opted to keep Tom Cable around as the offensive line coach, despite his track record of failure. So not much is to be expected from the offensive line this year, putting even more pressure on an easily frightened Derek Carr.

On defense, we see a bit of reorganization. The defensive line coach from last year is now a senior assistant on the defensive staff. A new coach was hired to take on oversight duties over the defensive line. On a similar note, the senior assistant from last year will now be training the defensive backs exclusively - the old coach that managed the secondary has been sent packing.

Once again, I was wrong last year. I truly believed Gruden would work his magic and turn the Raiders into a decent team. Instead, the man literally traded away two of his best players, leaving the roster truly bereft of any real talent outside of Jared Cook, who took his talents to an actual contender this year. Too many holes on the roster and a lack of identity led the Raiders to only four wins last year.

Before delving into the negatives, let’s start off on a positive note. Oakland did score a victory in the offseason by scooping Antonio Brown away from the Steelers in what literally was more a fire sale than an equitable trade. Despite his diva-like ways, Antonio Brown will be fundamentally critical to any success the Raiders see on offense. With Brown lining up for the offense, the Raiders can actually threaten opposing defenses, forcing them to commit too many resources to one player and thereby opening up opportunities for the other skill players running routes. Should Gruden be able to scheme well and Derek Carr be able to execute consistently enough, we could see some great performances this year from the likes of Tyrell Williams and Jalen Richard.

But those are big ifs that largely hinge on Gruden and his coaching ability. It’s funny that I write this just as Gruden has gone on record to state a growing affection for _Nathan Peterman,_ of all players. The same Nathan Peterman that notoriously threw five interceptions in his first start ever in the NFL and has failed to redeem himself ever since. The same Nathan Peterman some claim to be the worst quarterback to ever start an NFL game. What does this say about Gruden and his grasp on reality? Maybe Gruden sees something in him I don’t? Then again...maybe it’s simpler than that - the man just doesn’t have an eye for talent. After all, shipping out proven players in Khalil Mack and Amari Cooper for draft picks were idiotic moves. And in fact, those moves look all the more foolish when you consider Oakland’s first draft pick this year was an overreach, according to some reputable analysts. Allegedly, the Raiders could have flipped the fourth pick for more draft value and still have ended up with the man they would have drafted anyway at that spot.

Speaking of which, their draft board emphasized men of character above most other factors. It’s a preference that I honestly find peculiar - this team went out of its way in the offseason to sign Vontaze Burfict and Richie Incognito, both players known for being dysfunctional jackasses. The latter has already been suspended two games this year for unprofessional conduct. So this whole idea of mixing impressionable rookies with veterans prone to reckless behavior doesn’t sound right to me. Once again, strange marriages like this hinge on Jon Gruden’s ability to lead, but his failure as a schemer and talent evaluator last year has me wary of his overall competence as a coach. Put simply, I’ve lost faith in Gruden.

But at the very least, the Raiders do have a better roster this year compared to last year’s. Even the defense is a slight step up, though not much has been done from a personnel standpoint in the offseason. The hope here is that the defensive players drafted last year are able to mesh into a functional defense this year, given all the action they’ve seen in their rookie seasons. It would also help if some of the defensive rookies drafted this year are able to contribute as well. So there’s a remote possibility that this defense may actually be serviceable.

**_UPDATE_**

After an offseason full of needless drama, Antonio Brown is gone. The team released him after Brown publicly expressed a desire to leave the team. Honestly, it was a good move given the circumstances. Unfortunately, this also puts the kibosh on the Raiders season. I had to downgrade them to the very last tier. Oakland's offense will be incredibly pedestrian this year.
