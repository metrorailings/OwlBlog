**Coaching Turnover:**

On offense, we see quite a bit of reorganization this year now that Mornhinweg has been replaced with one of the main assistant coaches from last year, Greg Roman. Only one face is missing from last year - Thomas Hammock. Hammock left to become the head coach for a Division I college. In his former role is Matt Weiss, the wide receivers coach from last year. Speaking of which, the team’s only offensive coaching hire this year is David Culley, who’ll be overlooking the receiving corps now that Weiss will be managing the running backs. Kind of confusing how the Ravens shifted offensive coaches around different roles, though perhaps Greg Roman is simply trying to reorg his coaches where he best sees fit.

On defense, a new assistant coach has been added to train up the defensive backs. Other than that, everything remains the same from last year.

The Ravens should do all right this season. The biggest question is whether Lamar Jackson can actually take that next step as a professional quarterback and commit more to passing the ball. Jackson is probably one of the two or three most athletic people in his position, but his skills as a traditional passer are just nowhere up to snuff. His balls are usually wide off the mark and his decision-making isn’t on point yet.

Luckily for the Ravens, Greg Roman is the type of man that can work with somebody like Lamar. Several years ago, Roman actually made Colin Kaepernick look competent for a whole season. Granted, Kaepernick was fortunate to be on such a strong team in the first place, but the fact that the 49ers went to the Super Bowl one year with Kaepernick at the helm of their offense stands as testament to Roman’s abilities to work with passers that prefer their legs over their arms. Also worth noting, the year after that, San Francisco fell just short of making the Super Bowl yet again with Kaepernick as their signal caller. So even though the Ravens have their work cut out for them, Roman should help make the situation a little easier.

The situation would have been so much easier had the Ravens actually surrounded their young signal caller with adequate talent. The reality here is that Baltimore lacks any dependable receivers that can help the quarterback, as (with one exception) the only skill players worthy of mention are either tight ends or halfbacks. Lamar needs those archetypical X receivers that can make circus catches every now and then. The Ravens have given him anything but that. Marquise Brown seems to be a positive step in the right direction, but it’s worth noting that man is more of a speedster than a jump receiver.

One more thing to talk about - defense. Baltimore had one of the best defenses last year. Not sure if that can be expected for this season though. Four key players were lost during free agency - C.J. Mosley, Za’Darius Smith, Eric Weddle, and defensive stalwart Terrell Suggs. While the Ravens did sign Earl Thomas to shore up the safety position, nothing else was really done to try and fill the vacancies left at other position groups by those free agents. It’s clear the team will be counting on depth players and draft selections to rise up and make this defense truly complete.

So their prognosis here is a middling season. Whether they end with a winning record and a possible postseason berth depends on variance. Given luck was probably on their side last year, I’m inclined to think this year will be a losing year for Baltimore.
