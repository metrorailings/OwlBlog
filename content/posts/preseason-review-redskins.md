**Coaching Turnover:**

On offense, we have a peculiar situation. The offensive coordinator from last year has been demoted to an offensive assistant this year. In his former role goes last year’s quarterbacks coach, Kevin O’Connell. O’Connell is apparently a bit of a rising star within the organization. All the other coaches on the offensive staff have been retained, save for Wes Phillips, who likely left the organization voluntarily to join his pal Sean McVay and his dad Wade Phillips over in Los Angeles. In his place goes a new face that wasn’t on the team before.

On defense, Greg Manusky managed to keep his job and most of his staff. The inside linebackers and defensive backs coaches from last year have both been replaced this year with veteran coaches that have served as coordinators, albeit with muddled degrees of success.

These Redskins are a goddamn mess. Frankly, I’ll be gobsmacked if this team doesn’t end the season with one of the worst records (if not **_the_** worst record).

One thing that baffles me is their decision to demote last year’s offensive coordinator instead of outright firing him. Why keep your old offensive coordinator around in a lesser role? Not only is it demoralizing, but that move potentially jeopardizes any efforts by the team’s senior management to bring harmony back into the organization after a disastrous season last year.

On defense, things are only slightly better from a coaching perspective. Greg Manusky managed to survive despite his defense’s sorry performances last year. However, the Redskins brain trust are trying to help him by hiring two veteran coaches in Rob Ryan and Ray Horton. Both men will serve under Manusky as position coaches and thankfully not as assistant coordinators - neither have succeeded as coordinators themselves. If these three coaches could actually function well together, this defense may actually be serviceable for once. But with Rob Ryan having a bit of a history as a firebrand and Ray Horton not having had much success in his most recent stints, I can’t be certain that these defensive coaches will sync with one another.

Beyond coaching, things don’t get much better. On offense, the Redskins look less like a professional football team and more like a war-torn country. Neither Case Keenum nor Dwayne Haskins look ready to assume control of the offense. That offensive line is in shambles, especially now that Trent Williams seems intent on holding out indefinitely out of concern for his health. And worst of all, Washington lacks any notable skill players. Notice that I didn’t name even a single player as a definitive vector on offense. The Redskins are the only team that lack reliable playmakers on offense. Instead, we have an assortment of players that have only showed up every now and then. If two of the skill players manage to break out as reliable producers, I’ll be impressed, especially given the team’s sad situation at quarterback.

The defense isn’t that bad, but it isn’t necessarily good either. Questions remain about whether this defense can bounce back after a disastrous season last year. The biggest question comes up front, as the defense lacks solid pass rushers now that Preston Smith left for greener pastures over in Wisconsin. Kerrigan cannot carry this pass rush by himself.

All that being said, I expect the Redskins to be one of the worst teams in football.
