Another year of high hopes, another year that'll end with disappointment.

The Saints roster is loaded with high-end talent. The coaches are some of the best in their respective fields. The quarterback still demonstrates moments of brilliance. So what's wrong then? Why can't this team finally make good on their potential and bring home another Lombardi trophy?

A couple reasons why. One, Drew Brees is aging and it's showing, particularly in the latter half of the season - his arm strength fails him as the season rolls on. The passing offense suffers hard as a result. Second, the defense isn't just good enough to carry the team once the offense begins dragging its feet. It's the defensive front that bears so much of the blame in this regard - only one player on that line can be counted as elite. Marcus Davenport was drafted a few years back to give the defensive front a dominant bookend opposite Cameron Jordan, but he hasn't really panned out as of yet. New Orleans better hope the third year is his breakout year...

It's those reasons that'll damn the Saints once they reach the postseason. It's entirely possible New Orleans may finish with the best record in the NFC once again this season, but that achievement does little to remediate the issues I outlined above.
