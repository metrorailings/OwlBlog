High expectations. The Saints rightfully stand as the presumptive NFC favorites to advance to the Super Bowl. Last year, Brees’ shoulder injury proved to be their undoing in the postseason. With Brees returning to top form this season and the coaching staff from last year having been fully retained, New Orleans stands as the favorite to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl this year.

If the team does have a particular point of weakness, it’s the receiving corps. Poaching Jared Cook from Oakland is a good start towards addressing the deficiencies in this unit, but the Saints need more options at receiver to weather the injury bug and to exploit defenses that shift too much coverage over to Michael Thomas. As I noted above, Tre’Quan Smith and Ted Ginn **_may_** be those alternative options, but that remains to be seen.

Also should talk about the defense a bit. All three levels of the defense feature solid talent. Their only deficit comes in the trenches - New Orleans doesn’t have that complementary pass rusher lining up opposite Cameron Jordan. The hope here is that Marcus Davenport can take that next step forward and become a featured edge rusher in his own right.
