**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, the team restructured their organization. Schottenheimer will now have two junior coordinators reporting to him, Dave Canales as the passing game coordinator and Brennan Carroll as the run-game coordinator. Interestingly enough, most of the offensive assistance coaches from last year have been retained, just shifted into revised roles.

On defense, the only major change is Damione Lewis coming into the fold as the defensive line coach, replacing Jethro Franklin from last year. It's unclear whether Franklin was actually fired in the offseason, but it's worth noting that last year's defensive front was barely serviceable. So it seems likely the Hawks' brain trust actively sought to bring in a new coach this year to oversee that unit.

For some reason, I didn't expect much of this Seahawks teams before I started researching them. Maybe trading away two first-rounders for Jamal Adams left a bad taste in my mouth. Or maybe it's the fact that this team doesn't respect its marquis pass rushers much. But after conducting some research and hearing a few other folks analyze this team, I have to conclude that the Seahawks are one of the more complete teams in the league.

On offense, Seattle's pretty blessed to boast four notable skill players and the services of an elite quarterback in Russell Wilson. Seems like a damn shame that this team spends so much time running the ball when it can afford to be much more dynamic on offense. If Schotty and Pete Carroll are truly intent on bringing home a championship this season, then abandon the old-school mentality and open this offense up.

On defense, the team's in good shape along their back seven. Acquiring Jamal Adams from the Jets gives the Hawks a safety that can double as a quick-footed linebacker inside the box. It's a luxury Carroll's been missing since Kam Chancellor retired. I suppose it makes sense - the Seahawks need to hold their own against San Francisco's creative ground game should they want to wrest the division title from them this year. But the pass coverage still concerns me on a few levels. For one thing, Quandre Diggs isn't nearly talented enough to man the free safety role in Pete Carroll's cover-three system. Playing free safety in this style of defense is a highly stressful job, as the free safety is the only defender patrolling the deep middle of the field. In this respect, Earl Thomas was arguably far more important than Kam Chancellor during the Seahawks' championship years. Yet, Carroll opted to trade away valuable draft capital to find a suitable replacement for the less important player.

A team could live with one weak point in their pass coverage. But add a second weak point and the pass coverage presents itself as a serious vulnerability. In the case of the Seahawks, that second point of weakness comes up front with their lack of a pass rush. If anything, this concerns me far more than Quandre Diggs. After all, the most important defensive players during their golden years were their pass rushers. And this year, the Seahawks are relying on a bunch of unproven draft picks to carry this pass rush. Sure, the Hawks can luck out with both Jarran Reed and L.J. Collier developing into dominant trench players this season. But past experience tells me this is _highly_ unlikely. It's hard enough to raise one quality pass rusher, let alone two.

The pass rush isn't quite as critical during the regular season as much as the postseason. So I expect Seattle to fare well in their regular outings. It's the playoffs that'll doom them so long as their pass rush remains virtually nonexistent.
