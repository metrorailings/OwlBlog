Before I started looking at this team, I wasn’t expecting much. The Seahawks lost a few too many critical players from last year - Doug Baldwin, Earl Thomas, and Frank Clark. Upon further review though, it became evident I was overrating some of these players. Baldwin has aged out of his prime and Earl Thomas is approaching the tail end of his career. Frank Clark’s presence will be missed though, as he was the best pass rusher on a team that was pretty bare along the defensive front in the first place. But after doing some accounting of players on the roster, I realized that the team has been going out of its way to address its deficiencies along the defensive line.

It all started with John Schneider taking a low-risk gamble by signing Ezekiel Ansah to a one-year deal - if Ansah can finally buck the injury bug that’s plagued him the past few years, then it’s likely this gamble pays off big. Then the Seahawks went and spent premium draft capital on a promising edge rushing prospect in L.J. Collier. While Collier is not expected to replace Frank Clark’s production right away, I think the team thought that pairing him with Ezekiel Ansah and Jarran Reed may be enough to keep that pass rush humming. However, seeing the Texans desperate to rid themselves of Jadaveon Clowney, Schneider jumped at the opportunity to acquire the former first-pick from Houston for next to nothing. Clowney is a proven commodity as a defensive end - so long as the man remains healthy, the Hawks can count on him as a premiere pass rusher. So it seems the Seahawks defense may not be as barebones as I once thought.

Same with the offense too. Doug Baldwin will be sorely missed as a veteran leader and an outside receiver, but Seattle still has options at offense. If player performances from last year are strongly indicative of player performances this year, then Seattle should be able to count on Tyler Lockett, Chris Carson, and Will Dissly to produce on offense. Generally, good coaches can keep good players playing well year-over-year, so I expect all three skill players to stand out yet again. Best of all, those three have different roles from one another on offense, giving Seattle the freedom to weave more creative and intricate concepts into their playbook.

So given the surprisingly robust roster and the coaching staff remaining almost entirely intact from last year, I actually expect good things from the Hawks this year.
