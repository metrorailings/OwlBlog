**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, a quarterbacks coach has been hired so that Randy Fichtner can focus more on his coordinator duties. The team also found their long-term replacement for the late Darryl Drake.

On defense, nothing has changed from last year.

I never realized before running through their roster that this team is remarkably stacked along all levels of their defense.  The secondary, long seen as a liability, now resurfaces as an area of strength after Minkah Fitzpatrick was brought into the fold last year. The front seven has regained its former dominance after the emergence of T.J. Watt and the introduction of first-round rookie Devin Bush. Pittsburgh's defense looks to shape up as one of the best, so long as injury doesn't rob the team of their primo talent.

It's the offense that worries me a bit. James Conner is a nice little story, but his ability as a runner is so limited. Conner is not the solution the organization has been seeking ever since Le'Veon Bell bitterly parted ways with Pittsburgh. On top of that, Roethlisberger is an injury-laden quarterback entering the twilight years of his career. Because of that, two questions will naturally plague the Steelers this season - will Ben play well and can he survive the better part of the season healthy?

The addition of Eric Ebron will help things a bit, as Heath Miller has been sorely missed ever since his retirement. Ebron may finally give the team a dependable option at tight end, so long as he doesn't miss a beat from his days in Indianapolis. Furthermore, Diontae Johnson and James Washington may be able to compliment Juju and give Big Ben some viable outlets in the passing game. But that's far from definite.

And that's the key point here when we look at the offense. Things are anything but certain regarding the future prospects of this unit, as too many questions keep the outlook here muddy. The quarterback, the wide receivers, the halfbacks, the tight ends...all of those position groups are laden with uncertainties. Can Roethlisberger play well heading into his 17th season? Will James Conner blossom this year and give this team a serious rushing attack? Can anybody else but Juju on this team step up in the receiving game?

It's out of respect to the coaching staff, the stacked defense, and the overall continuity of the personnel that I'm labelling this team as playoff contenders. I think a wild-card ticket will be their reward when the regular season ends.
