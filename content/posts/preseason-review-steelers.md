**Coaching Turnover:**

On offense, only the running backs coach has been formally flipped during the offseason. However, with Darryl Drake’s sudden death, the Steelers are now without their wide receivers coach from last year. Interestingly enough, it seems the team is content leaving Drake’s role vacant this year, maybe as a sort of tribute to him. One more thing worth noting....Mike Munchak, the offensive line coach last year, left during the offseason to join Vic Fangio’s staff over in Denver - instead of shopping around for a new coach, the Steelers simply promoted his assistant to oversee the offensive line this year.

On defense, outside linebackers coach Joey Porter was fired during the offseason. Defensive coordinator Keith Butler will now be directly overseeing the outside linebackers on top of his regular coordinator duties. Other than that, the staff has remained intact from last year, save for the addition of Teryl Austin in an advisory role.

The Steelers have finally rid themselves of locker room cancers in Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell. Some analysts predict a year of redemption for Ben Roethlisberger following a season dominated by petty drama and sloppy infighting. I say hold the brakes here. Even though Ben still has some life left in him, time is starting to wear him down. Last year, his quarterback play left much to be desired - mistakes were more common in his game than I could remember in years before. Perhaps nothing better exemplifies this than the game against the Broncos last year. Waning moments of the fourth quarter, third down, the Steelers are a yard or two away from tying the game up. In what looked like a run-pass option, Big Ben opted to pass. Except his pass ended up laughably short, right into the arms of a _defensive tackle,_ of all people_._ It’s moments like these that make me wonder whether Roethlisberger can still demonstrate competence consistently enough to take this team far into the playoffs.

Now one could argue Ben’s job is made all the more difficult now that Antonio Brown is no longer with the team. While a valid point, I trust the Steelers brain trust to field a receiving corps that will far surpass expectations. After all, Mike Tomlin and his staff has had an entire offseason to scheme up a passing game that’s no longer headlined by Antonio Brown. So even if Pittsburgh doesn’t have a player of the same caliber as Brown, I do expect a few receivers to step up in his absence.

On defense, the team is looking more hopeful. T.J. Watt’s breakout last year was good news for a team that hasn’t had a dominant pass rusher the last few years (unless you count the aging James Harrison). The drafting of Devin Bush this year was yet another good move for a team that desperately missed the presence of an athletic linebacker. And the signing of free agent Steven Nelson should help shore up a secondary missing a legitimate cornerback opposite Joe Haden. If there is an area of concern, it’s depth - a key injury or two could cripple them defensively. Unless several other players step up, the Steelers need to hope the god of good health smiles upon them this year.

Overall, I expect a postseason berth. A Super Bowl is a possibility, albeit a remote one.
