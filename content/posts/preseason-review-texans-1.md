**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, we see a bit of reorganization. Carl Smith is no longer the quarterbacks coach, though he will remain with the team as a consultant. In his place is T.J. Yates, a junior assistant from last year. Other than that, no major change.

On to the other side of the football, we have a surface-level change in new defensive coordinator, Anthony Weaver. In reality, it's not a major reset, as Romeo Crennel actively reduced his role in the organization given his advanced age. His defensive line coach from last year has been promoted to oversee the defensive unit in his place. The more significant changes on this defensive staff come in the form of Chris Rumph and D'Anton Lynn. The former was brought into the fold to replace last year's outside linebackers coach, who was fired during the offseason. The latter has been promoted to oversee the entire secondary after last year's defensive backs coach mutually parted ways with the organization.

As long as Bill O'Brien is head coach, this Texans organization is doomed to crash and burn every year. Sure, they may have won the division four years over, but that crown has been utterly meaningless going into the postseason. Each of their playoff campaigns ended pretty dismally.

Simply put, O'Brien doesn't get it. He doesn't understand what it takes to build a truly great organization. Championship teams don't trade away their best playmakers for a cool nickel. Championship teams don't then replace those playmakers for busted talent with elaborate injury histories. If O'Brien expects this offense to not miss a beat after donating away Nuke Hopkins, he's mistaken. Brandin Cooks won't be swooping in to save the day, that's for sure. There's a reason why ace coaches like Sean Payton, Bill Belichick, and Sean McVay were quick to trade him.

The silver lining in that Hopkins trade comes in the form of David Johnson. Unlike Carlos Hyde, David Johnson can function in multiple roles. Hyde was the hammer to their power rushing game but lacked the tools to run receiving routes out of the backfield. David Johnson can be that bell-cow runner capable of playing receiver as well.

Still, the offense will be invariably worse this year. The defense may not be worse, but it'll still likely be an underperforming unit, given much hasn't been done to fix its shortcomings. A new outside linebackers coach has been installed this year in the hopes that somebody can finally develop another pass rusher who can aptly compliment J.J. Watt. I'll believe that's possible when I see it though. Furthermore, those coverage defenders still remain a bit of a liability, though the addition of Bradley Roby last year has given the unit some semblance of respect. Their draft acquisitions this year may remediate those weaknesses somewhat, but it'll take time for the rookies to settle into place and reliably contribute value.

It's not going to be a pretty year for these Texans. The loss of Hopkins will be too much to overcome, even for the resourceful Deshaun Watson. It's out of respect to Watson and his weapons that I'm even considering Houston as a fringe contender for a wild card seat, but the team is still missing too many pieces needed to survive well into the postseason.
