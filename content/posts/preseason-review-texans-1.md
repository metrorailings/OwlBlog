**COACHING TURNOVER  
**On offense, we see a bit of reorganization. Carl Smith is no longer the quarterbacks coach, though he will remain with the team as a consultant. In his place is T.J. Yates, a junior assistant from last year. Other than that, no major change.

On to the other side of the football, we have a major surface-level change in new defensive coordinator, Anthony Weaver. In reality, it's not a major reset, as Romeo Crennel actively reduced his role in the organization given his advanced age. His defensive line coach from last year has been promoted to oversee the defensive unit in his place. The more significant changes on this defensive staff come in the form of Chris Rumph and D'Anton Lynn. The former was brought into the fold to replace last year's outside linebackers coach, who was fired during the offseason. The latter has been promoted to oversee the entire secondary after last year's defensive backs coach mutually parted ways with the organization.
