On the offensive end of things, Houston will now be shifting offensive coordinator duties away from Bill O’Brien. Oddly enough, the tight ends coach from last year will now be the offensive coordinator. A bit of a bizarre choice given that the tight end position group was arguably the weakest link of last year’s Texans. Besides that, the quarterbacks coach has been replaced with another journeyman quarterbacks coach.

On defense, every key coach from last year has been retained.

***

So my analysis from last year was on point, except I underestimated how awful Bill O’Brien’s decision-making can get. His old-school thought process is not workable in today’s NFL. And frankly, it’s indicative of his limitations as coach. Good coaches adapt to the times. Mediocre coaches stubbornly cling to outdated traditions.

To his credit, the offense (when healthy) ran smoothly as O’Brien adjusted to his personnel on offense and drew up more pass-friendly schemes. The key here is health. Sophomore player Keke Coutee and speedster Will Fuller have to remain on the field for this offense to be functioning at an incredibly high level. Should Fuller, Coutee, Deandre Hopkins, and Deshaun Watson avoid major injury, this offense has the potential to be the best in the league.

The defense is still reworking things in the secondary. Kareem Jackson and Tyrann Matthieu were ousted in favor of Tashaun Gipson and Bradley Roby. Neither player is expected to elevate that sluggish passing defense. Once again, the performance of this defense will have to rely on JJ Watt, Jadaveon Clowney, and the other pass rushers being able to control the line of scrimmage this season.

That being said, I’m not sure I understand the thinking guiding the team’s management this year. The Texans are running experiments this year in the front office, purposely leaving the general manager role vacant in favor of a committee approach. Furthermore, O’Brien promoting the coach who oversaw the worst position group last year to the role of offensive coordinator this year leaves me even more wary. On paper, this team should be considered Super Bowl contenders. But the shaky management means that the team needs to be stacked from a talent perspective for me to have any confidence in their championship prospects. Anyway, I do expect another trip to the postseason this year, but that trip will be cut short early. Then again, a few key injuries on offense or defense would torpedo their postseason hopes.

**_UPDATE_**

Two key players will likely not be playing for the Texans this year - Lamar Miller and Jadaveon Clowney. The former suffered an ACL tear during a preseason game while the latter will likely be traded away.

On Lamar Miller, his absence robs the team of depth in the backfield. While Duke Johnson is expected to step up as the team’s bellcow halfback, the Texans have nobody worthwhile behind him on the roster. Houston will be forced to go to the junk heap to pick up running backs capable of working relief duty behind Johnson.

On Jadaveon Clowney, the Texans are gambling here - the team will be relying on Whitney Mercilus or somebody else making up for Clowney’s pass rush production. If last year was any indication though, the team lacks players capable of consistently harassing quarterbacks outside of Jadaveon and JJ Watt. Speaking of which, it’s not even certain Watt can play through another season without injury given his past history. Should injury once again sideline him this year, Houston’s passing defense may be effectively reduced to shambles.

**_UPDATE 2_**

The Texans made silly moves as training camp wounded down, sacrificing a boatload of high draft picks for an elite left tackle. Not only that, but Jadaveon Clowney was finally dealt out to the Seahawks for literal peanuts. And it reminds me that these Texans seems to do more things wrong than right as an organization.

I was looking at the coaching staff again and I realized that the offensive line coach from last year is still gainfully employed in the same position this year, despite Deshaun Watson being sacked more than any other quarterback in the league last season. It’s further proof that management cannot be trusted. And in football, coaching is just as critical (if not more) than roster talent. Therefore, I’m downgrading Houston here. And that means this team won’t be taking another postseason trip this year.
