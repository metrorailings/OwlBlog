**COACHING TURNOVER**  
After some surprising performances from Ryan Tannehill and Derrick Henry, the entire offensive coaching staff has been retained from last year.

On defense though, we do see some changes. The biggest change comes with Dean Pees retiring yet again, leaving defensive play-calling duties up in the air for the time being. Aside from that, the team lost two of their assistants last year, so new coaches have been introduced to replace them - Jim Haslett for the outside linebackers and Anthony Midget for the secondary.
