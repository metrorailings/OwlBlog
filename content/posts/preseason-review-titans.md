**Staff Turnover:**

Despite Matt LeFleur’s departure for greener pastures in Wisconsin, the team managed to retain the rest of its offensive staff. Tight ends coach Arthur Smith was promoted to the coordinator position this year.

On defense, we have no new faces. Every major staff member from last year has been retained.

Tennessee has quite a few good things going for them - a charismatic head coach in Mike Vrabel, a coaching staff that’s almost wholly carried over from last year, and quite a bit of talent at select spots along their roster.

Still, Tennessee’s biggest problem has always been the durability of their franchise quarterback. Mariota can’t really lead this team to the next level from the sidelines. Sure, Tannehill can spell him here and there if need be...but Tannehill is no Nick Foles. The Titans need Mariota healthy in order to be considered a top contender. And there’s little evidence that he can stave off injury for an entire season, especially if he insists on running with the ball every now and then.

So I think Vegas is spot on with their assessment of the Titans as an unremarkable 8-win team. It’s hard to make a firm prediction here, as variance will likely dictate on what side of 500 they’ll land on this season.

**_UPDATE_**

Michael Lombardi is reporting that the Titans seem to be losing confidence in Marcus Mariota. While Mariota has played well at moments, his career has been marred by injuries and _inconsistency_. The man has yet to put together a whole season of quality work. If the coaches genuinely believe Mariota isn’t the answer at offense, it wouldn’t surprise me if that lack of conviction infects the team with a sort of malaise that drags them down into the dregs as the season progresses. After all, these Titans are a team that generally perform well, but excel at nothing - Mariota is more or less the de facto face of this Titan team. I do believe the Titans will be the worst team in the division this year.
