**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, Kevin Stefanski's departure allowed Gary Kubiak to fully assume command of the offense. Stefanski managed to poach away the wide receivers coach to his new home in Cleveland, so Minnesota promoted a junior assistant to oversee that position group.

The changes on defense were much more dramatic. The team let go of last year's coordinator as well as the coaches responsible for the defensive backs. Coordinator duties have been split across two coaches, though in reality, Mike Zimmer will always be the manager in charge of the defense. New names have been brought in to train up the young secondary.
