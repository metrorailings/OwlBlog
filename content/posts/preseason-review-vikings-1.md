**COACHING TURNOVER**  
On offense, Kevin Stefanski's departure allowed Gary Kubiak to fully assume command of the offense. Stefanski managed to poach away the wide receivers coach to his new home in Cleveland, so Minnesota promoted a junior assistant to oversee that position group.

The changes on defense were much more dramatic. The team let go of last year's coordinator as well as the coaches responsible for the defensive backs. Coordinator duties have been split across two coaches, though in reality, Mike Zimmer will always be the manager in charge of the defense. New names have been brought in to train up the young secondary.

Last year's Vikings and this year's Vikings shouldn't be that different. Despite losing Stefan Diggs to the Bills, Minnesota's offensive system should still keep humming so long as the offensive line and Dalvin Cook can continue executing on zone-run concepts. As long as the ground game is productive, Kirk Cousins will still be money on play-action passes. Don't get me wrong, having one less major weapon will hurt, but the coaches should be able to patch things up witht a combination of Chad Beebe, Justin Jefferson, and Tajae Sharpe.

If anything, the defense may present an issue here. I still expect a top-flight defense, but these Vikings need more than that should they want to go deep into the playoffs. Kirk Cousins cannot be trusted to put this team on his back. Barring an _annus mirabilis_, Cousins will need help from everybody - his offensive linemen, his skill position players, and (most importantly) all of his fellow defensive personnel. A defense that can shut down opposing offenses can make things easier on an offense that goes through occasional fits.

But this Minnesota defense is short-handed in a few respect. One, that defensive line is desperately in need of a second playmaker now that the team has cut loose Everson Griffin and Linval Joseph. The Vikings brain trust are hoping that Ifeadi Odenigbo and Jaleel Johnson could replace them at their respective positions, but that remains to be seen. Two, the backfield is a little young. With the release of Xavier Rhodes and Trae Waynes, the team's contingent of cornerbacks have lost quite a bit of veteran experience. Expect teams to be able to throw on these Vikings should the pass rush fail to hit home (which may be the norm if Ifeadi Odenigbo fails to pan out).

A playoff berth is a given here. Minnesota is too good a team to not make the playoffs. The real question to ask here is how far this team advances in the postseason. I don't see any real reason to call this team championship contenders. Key players were lost in the offseason and haven't been adequately replaced. The team's counting on young prospects to step up here, but odds are only a few of them will take their game to the next level.
