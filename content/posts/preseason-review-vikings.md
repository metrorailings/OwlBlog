**Coaching Turnover:**

Even though the interim offensive coordinator has been formally hired into his role this year, things are significantly different on offense. I suspect that’s mostly because of Gary Kubiak coming onboard as an offense guru and the assistant head coach under Mike Zimmer. Other than the running backs coach and an offensive line assistant, the entire staff has been replaced from last year.

On defense, however, things have remained the same. The only change has come with the addition of Terence Newman as an assistant defensive backs coach. While Newman didn’t exactly light the world on fire as a cornerback, the former player understands the finer aspects of Zimmer’s system and has the experience needed to mentor younger defensive backs.

The Vikings last year had their postseason hopes dashed due to some awkward performances from Kirk Cousins, some horrendous pass protection from an underwhelming offensive line, and some bad coaching from then offensive coordinator John DeFilippo. Mike Zimmer thankfully fired DeFilippo near the end of the season the moment it became obvious that the team could not count on him to coach a consistently viable offense. In his place went Kevin Stefanski, who impressed enough to keep his job this year, even as the team brought Gary Kubiak onboard as an advisor.

Honestly, now that I look at this Vikings team....I’m looking at a Super Bowl contender here. Minnesota has the makings of a championship team - a solid coaching staff, a roster loaded with quality players across the board, a franchise quarterback, and a respectable home field advantage.

That’s not to say the team is without weak points. One major downside that concerns me is the offensive line - Minnesota lacks any decent depth along the trenches on offense. Even though the Vikings spent a first-round draft pick this year on a center, it’s still going to take some time for the rookie to get up to speed. Furthermore, the Vikings released most of their guards from last year, leaving them cripplingly thin along the interior of the line. The signing of Josh Kline and the drafting of Dru Samia provides some superficial depth, but one injury along the line could cause havoc and trigger a reshuffling, in which linemen will once again be forced to play out of their natural positions in a desperate attempt to field a workable offensive line. Kirk Cousins would suffer the most if the Vikings are forced to reorganize the offensive line, as the man needs all the help he can get.

We also see some major overhaul along the offensive coaching staff, courtesy of Gary Kubiak. It usually takes some time for a new coaching staff to synergize with the players. But new coaching regimes have taken teams to the Super Bowl before. It does help to have a strong defense that can back up an offense still adjusting to a new scheme. Not only that, but Kubiak has won a Super Bowl in his own right with the Broncos several years ago. So I wouldn’t be too worried about the new offensive coaches here - they should be able to find their bearings sooner rather than later.

I expect this team to win the North and contend with the Eagles and the Saints for the NFC crown.
