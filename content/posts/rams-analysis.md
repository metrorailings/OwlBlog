Rather than list bullet points quickly explaining the Rams victory in the NFC championship game, I'll be doing a deep dive, keeping notes here as I watch coaches' film of the game.

***

##### 1st Quarter

The Saints started out hot, thanks to a smartly executed tight-end screen, Alvin Kamara running wheel routes, and Michael Thomas making catches against tight coverage.

Still...there were indications the Saints' success would be a little unsustainable. First off, Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh were constantly winning battles at the line of scrimmage - the two defensive tackles not only managed to harassed Drew Brees on a few of his pass attempts, but also limited Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram on run plays. Even against six-man boxes, the Rams were able to hold their own against New Orleans' rushers thanks to the play of those two key playmakers along the defensive line. Second, Los Angeles wholly committed themselves to double-teaming Michael Thomas whenever possible. Even though Thomas was able to produce in the first quarter, it would only be so long before Los Angeles would finally put the clamps on him.  And without Thomas, the Saints would have no receivers to depend upon in the passing game. Now if Drew Brees was an elite quarterback, he'd eventually find other receiving outlets as the game progressed...but we'll talk more about that later.

##### 2nd Quarter

The Rams offense finally got going after a successful fake punt deep in their half of the field. Immediately after the chains moved, McVay called in some of his best plays and sped up the tempo in order to try and ensure that fake punt would not be in vain. And it worked. The Rams were able to chew off major yardage on this drive. Thanks to McVay's game management, Jared Goff marshaled his offense down the field in a hostile environment. And even though this drive would only result in a field goal, it helped calm him down.

Drew Brees and company would get the ball back only to go three and out. First down was a failed run that was blown up in the back field courtesy of Aaron Donald. On second down, Brees was trying to hit a receiver running a deep dig route behind another skill player running upfield. But Aqib Talib rushed over from his zone on the other side of the field to cut off the dig receiver at the catch point, forcing Brees to pull the ball back and dump the pass off to a tight end in an act of desperation. On third down, the Saints thought they could flare Kamara out behind two skill receivers, but the Rams reacted too quickly and kept him from even catching the ball cleanly.

Brees would get the ball back soon after following a Rams punt. And the drive was looking positive at first...until Suh and Dante Fowler started wreaking havoc in the backfield. A fresh series of Saints downs began with Suh blowing by the guard to sack Brees for a 6-yard loss. On the next play, Fowler curled around right tackle Ryan Ramcyzk, invading Brees' personal space and throwing him into a panicky state that essentially ended any promise the play might have had. 3rd down, the Saints were content waving a white flag and playing for field position instead on the ensuing punt.

The Rams' last drive of the half ended successfully in a touchdown. Goff deserves some major credit on this drive - playing against nickel coverage in obvious passing plays, he still led his team down the field, his best moment being a dime pass 36 yards downfield to Brandin Cooks against man coverage. On top of that, the New Orleans pass rushers were simply unable to get any consistent pressure on Goff. The only time Goff felt any heat came on blitzes. The Rams adjusted pretty quickly and called max protection sets to ensure Goff had a bit more time in the pocket.

The quarter had eerie similarities to last week...

##### 3rd Quarter

The Rams started off on a weak note, striking out on their first drive without even gaining a single yard. The Saints, on the other hand, came out strong. Some adjustments are obvious here:

* No longer are the Saints halfbacks running headlong towards Suh and Donald. Most of the run plays were angled away from those two.
* Alvin Kamara became the team's bell cow in the pass game. Sean Payton must have noticed the Rams were a little too giddy with the man coverage on the back end of their defense. Which means coming out of the backfield, Kamara would almost always find himself matched up against a linebacker. Brees was more than happy exploiting that obvious mismatch.

The drive ended in a touchdown. The Rams were put in a bad spot - crap out on the next drive and the Saints would have seized all the momentum in the game. But Goff and Brandin Cooks saw to it that their team wouldn't fall too far behind. When the Rams offense stepped back out onto the field, the two connected on three big passes. The Saints' coverage defenders were simply unable to keep pace with Cooks. Eli Apple and Marshon Lattimore didn't even bother pressing the speedster at the line of scrimmage. And in a zone look on one play, not one Saint could track Cooks as he scurried behind his offensive linemen on a bootleg release. Speaking of which, the Saints defensive front fell way too hard for the bootleg on two different occasions, leaving Goff way too comfortable to air the ball out to Cooks.  No surprise then that Los Angeles came away with a touchdown to keep this game within three points.

The Saints started the ensuing drive on a very positive note, moving the chains twice. Then Aaron Donald blew up two consecutive plays to put the Saints into a long 3rd down situation. Given that the referees in the game were content letting defensive backs mug receivers in coverage, it's not much of a surprise that the Saints failed to convert against aggressive man coverage. Once again, the Rams defensive line forced another punt out of the Saints.

##### 4th Quarter

The last three drives stand out in this quarter. On the third-to-last drive, Goff was sensational on two big passes, including one on a long scramble out of the pocket. It's clear New Orleans had no respect for Goff's mobility - the third-year quarterback made them pay dearly for that disrespect here. Now this drive should have ended in a touchdown, but Sean McVay made the unusual move of not chancing a goal-line push on 4th and 1. Apparently, the man was content simply notching the game into a tie at that point. I'm not happy with the decision - the playoffs reward those coaches that make bold wagers. With only one yard to go, McVay needed to show confidence in his offense at that moment.

On the next drive, the Saints desperately needed some positive gains to score and, more importantly, close out the game without giving the ball back to the Rams. After a desperation lob to Alvin Kamara to move the chains, Drew Brees hooked up with Ted Ginn on a huge throw to put the Saints in position for an easy field goal. But then the next play may have been proof positive of something a few astute analysts have noted - Brees has lost some of his magic recently. The veteran passer was simply supposed to complete an easy pass to Michael Thomas on the next down. It was a play designed to keep the clock moving and throw the Rams defense off. 

But the throw was _limp_. It was _weak_. So weak that even the sure-handed Thomas couldn't reel in the ball. It's a damn shame too, as not only did the clock stop, but the Saints lost a down at such a critical moment. So how did Brees fail to make such an easy pass? Is it possible the man has been dealing with a hidden shoulder injury that's been nagging him over the past few weeks? If so, was that shoulder injury aggravated on that big throw? A silent injury would not only explain his lack of strength on this throw, but it would also shed light on his mundane numbers over the past several weeks. Ever since that great midseason run when the Saints declared themselves as the top dog in the league, Brees hasn't been sharp. His deep passes lacked touch and whatever rapport he's developed with his depth skill players was lost.  The Saints were still able to lock themselves in as the top seed of the NFC, but something was off with the man helming their offense. An injury would explain things quite nicely. It would also explain why even on that deep pass, the ball was wickedly underthrown.

Anyway, second down was a failed run. Third down ended with an incomplete pass that should have been flagged as defensive pass interference. And even though some people insist that the Saints had the game stolen from the at that very moment, it's clear to me that the Rams were the better team. Even if the referees called that play properly and New Orleans went on to grind the clock out to a Super Bowl berth, it wouldn't be a good win. New Orleans was **clearly** the weaker team in this match-up.

But with some abetting from the referees, the Rams were still in position to contest the result of this team. A touchdown would have resulted in a decisive Rams victory. A field goal would send this game into overtime.  But the Los Angeles offense would need to push the ball down at least 40 or so yards to be in a position to post points on the board.  Before the game, I wouldn't expect Goff to perform well in such a tense moment. But the man was mostly fantastic, connecting on two big passes to place his team in  position for a mid-range field goal. Only way he could have done better is if he threw a cleaner pass towards Robert Woods on a 3rd down conversion. Had he thrown a better ball, it's possible Woods would have motored into the end zone for a touchdown to end the game once and for all. But instead, the Rams settled for a field goal to push the game into extra time.
