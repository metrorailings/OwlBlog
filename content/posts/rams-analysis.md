Rather than list bullet points quickly explaining the Rams victory in the NFC championship game, I'll be doing a deep dive, keeping notes here as I watch coaches' film of the game.

The Saints started out hot, thanks to a smartly executed tight-end screen, Alvin Kamara running wheel routes, and Michael Thomas making catches against tight coverage.

Still...there were indications the Saints' success would be a little unsustainable. First off, Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh were constantly winning battles at the line of scrimmage - the two defensive tackles not only managed to harassed Drew Brees on a few of his pass attempts, but also limit Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram on run plays. Even against six-man boxes, the Rams were able to hold their own against New Orleans' rushes thanks to the play of those two. Second, Los Angeles wholly committed themselves to double-teaming Michael Thomas whenever possible. Even though Thomas was able to produce in the first quarter, it would only be so long before Los Angeles would finally put the clamps on him.  And without Thomas, the Saints would have no receivers to depend upon in the passing game. Now if Drew Brees was an elite quarterback, he'd eventually find other receiving outlets as the game progressed...but we'll talk more about that later.

The Rams offense finally got going after a successful fake punt deep in their half of the field. Immediately after the chains moves, McVay whipped out some of the best plays from his call sheet and sped up the tempo in order to try and ensure that fake punt would not be in vain. And it worked. The Rams were able to chew off some big plays. For the first time in his overall postseason career, Jared Goff marshaled his offense down the field in a hostile atmosphere. And even though this drive would only result in a field goal, it helped calm him down.
