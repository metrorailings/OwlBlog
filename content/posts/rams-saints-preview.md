The NFC championship will be the Los Angeles Rams visiting the New Orleans Saints in a rematch from the regular-season.

The Rams finally adjusted and began running the ball more, this time with CJ Anderson as the lead halfback. Gurley was the better rusher last week on a yards-per-rush basis, but CJ Anderson was without doubt the team's bell cow in the run game. And Anderson will need to go off again for his team to have any hope of winning in a hostile Superdome this week.

As I noted last week, it's pointedly difficult to win on the road in the postseason. A team needs to be stacked to have a real chance at winning, and the Rams fall short in that regard. Without Cooper Kupp, Los Angeles is one man down from having at least three reliable weapons on offense. It's a problem made all the more worse when you don't have an elite quarterback that can improvise and function under stressful circumstances - let's be real, Goff isn't that player that can put a team on his back, so he desperately needs some help here. On defense, Los Angeles lacks another pass rusher that can truly compliment Aaron Donald. Donkey Kong Suh was fantastic last week, but he's been unable to play at a consistently high level all throughout the season. I don't foresee him carrying over his success from last week into this game...unless a silent injury that's been nagging him the whole regular season has been suddenly lifted going into the postseason.

I feel pretty comfortable taking New Orleans here, especially given the competence of their coaching staff.  After the Eagles exploded out of the gate with two consecutive scores last week, the Saints' coaches adjusted defensively, rendering Philly's offense impotent for the rest of the game. It takes some damn good coaching to adjust that quickly. So Sean Payton and his crew won some credibility in my eyes that day.
