The Baltimore Ravens have stamped their ticket to the American Football Conference playoffs as the 4th seed. With Lamar Jackson at the helm of the offense, the Ravens are one of the more intriguing teams playing in the postseason.

#### Quarterback: _Lamar Jackson_

As I'll discuss at length in the next section, Lamar Jackson has been a jolt his team desperately needed after Joe Flacco went down with injury. But when it comes to executing on quarterbacking fundamentals...the man disappoints. He's not quite there yet as a pocket passer. It seems like every other pass he throws is wildly inaccurate. Any dime he throws is closely followed by a duck.

His numbers bear that out. An average of 156 passing yards over the last six weeks is not good for an NFL quarterback in today's league. Luckily...he is damn good at running the ball though, which plays into our next section.

#### Offensive Weapons: _Lamar Jackson, Gus Edwards, Mark Andrews_

Lamar can run. And because Lamar can run, the offense can avail itself of a new mode of attack - the read option. Not only is the read option an additional dynamic which opposing defenses will need to take into account, but the Ravens use the option with deadly precision. Baltimore may be the one team in the playoffs with the best ground game, thanks largely to the legs of Lamar and Gus Edwards, the team's starting halfback. Their running abilities will factor significantly into any offensive success the team sees in the postseason.

On the receiving end, the only pass-catcher Lamar connects with consistently is rookie Mark Andrews. Even though Lamar only targets him on approximately 15% of his routes, the man catches quite a few deep balls. And big passes usually lead to points. So I'll include him here as a significant offensive weapon.

#### Elite Pass Rushers: _Za'Darius Smith, Matt Judon_

I'll need to watch more game tape to ensure both players pass the eye test, but from statistics alone, both qualify as elite edge rushers. Za'Darius especially impressed me in that game against the Chargers, when he made a living hassling Philip Rivers in the backfield. Likewise, I see from analytical data that Matt Judon was dominant against the Chiefs and their formidable offensive line. I expect both players to show up next week against the Browns, as they'll need to win that game to assure themselves a spot in the playoffs. So I'll update this with more information then should the Ravens earn a postseason invitation.

#### Playoff Experience

While the Ravens are four years removed from their last playoff experience, the fact is that the team has been in contention for postseason placement for the past two years. Last year, the team lost out on the sixth seed after a brutal Week 17 loss against the Bengals. That elimination game should have been the experience they need to foster a playoff mentality.

It's worth noting that the quarterback and most of the starting skill players were not there last year though. In fact, the team's three best players on offense are all rookies. So that's some cause for concern. The defense should be dominant from the get-go, but the offense may need some time to find its rhythm in the first playoff game.

#### Coach: _John Harbaugh (HC), Don Martindale (DC), Marty Mornhinweg (OC)_

I've always respected John Harbaugh and the dignified presence he brings as head coach. His willingness to change was absolutely instrumental to the team winning the Super Bowl in 2012. Likewise, his embrace of Lamar Jackson midway through the season was integral to this team being in the playoffs.

The Ravens are in good hands with John Harbaugh at the helm.

#### Prognosis / Outlook

The Ravens should be able to survive a tight one against the Chargers in the Wild Card round. And should they be fortunate enough to be paired with New England in the division round, the Ravens could go as far as the conference championships. I do expect a division-round loss should they be facing the Chiefs instead.
