It's interesting to note that the Chiefs had some of their least productive passing games this year against the Chargers, a team that runs a defensive scheme pretty similar to that of the 49ers. So I wanted to see exactly _why_ the Chiefs weren't so dominant in the air game against Los Angeles in both regular season meetings. Was the passing game purposefully de-emphasized in favor of the ground game? Or were the Chiefs really stymied by the Chargers and their coverage against the deep pass? Let's find out.

On the first Chiefs drive, it seems evident the Chargers are playing the deep ball first and foremost. Their pass rushers have made sloppy mistakes on two plays though, keeping the drive alive.
