The Chiefs and Titans faced each other once before in the regular season. Let's just watch that match and see if we can pick up some detailed insights that would inform us in their playoff rematch.

***

The Titans are taking advantage of Kansas City's single-high coverage, nailing a big throw off play-action that ultimately led to a touchdown a few minutes later. Kansas City can negate this by emulating the Patriots strategy and keeping two safeties deep, therefore encouraging the Titans into running the ball more and passing to receivers running intermediate routes.

Tennessee's defensive backs are not pressing enough against the Chiefs skill players. But then again...it's a risky proposition considering a failed press can lead to a dismal result for the Titans defense. 

The Titans have been big beneficiaries of luck in this game. Not only has Kansas been hit unfairly with penalties that ended a potential touchdown drive, but the Chiefs have been ravaged by injuries to their offensive front in the first half. Also worth mentioning is Frank Clark dropping a gift of an interception.

I wonder if Carrente is more inclined to calling penalties against road teams. If so, that doesn't bode well for the Titans.

So as it turns out, Carrente is more prone to favoring home teams in terms of penalties. Only two other referees this season have shown more favorability towards the host teams. Good news for the Chiefs.

Tennessee defense masking its coverage scheme while Kansas City continues using layers of misdirection to move the ball down the field. So far, the Chiefs are winning this battle.

Kansas City pass coverage has stifled the Titans passing attack here outside of one play. Their run defense is horrible, but at least the Chiefs can afford to put an extra man in the box and play man coverage against the Titans skill players.

Even against seven-man boxes, Derrick Henry is still chewing off huge chunks of yardage. The Chiefs are going to have a hard time keeping Henry from popping off.
