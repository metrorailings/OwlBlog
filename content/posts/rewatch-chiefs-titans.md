The Chiefs and Titans faced each other once before in the regular season. Let's just watch that match and see if we can pick up some detailed insights that would inform us in their playoff rematch.

The Titans are taking advantage of Kansas City's single-high coverage, nailing a big throw off play-action that ultimately led to a touchdown a few minutes later. Kansas City can negate this by emulating the Patriots strategy and keeping two safeties deep, therefore encouraging the Titans into running the ball more and passing to receivers running intermediate routes.
