Given that the Packers will be visiting San Francisco yet again to contend against the 49ers for the NFC crown, let's see if we can collect some useful insights from the first match that will inform our bets for the rematch.

***

The 49ers defensive line is manhandling this Packers offensive line. Nick Bosa, DJ Jones, Arik Armstead, and DeForest Buckner are all doing well so far to start the game.

Two bad penalties against the Packers have set back their momentum.

Horrible call on a 4th and 1 by Matt LaFleur. Just sad. A run up the middle. Nothing more than that.

I've seen enough. I question whether the Packers are capable of playing drop-back football. At the same time, I wonder the same thing about these 49ers. I'll need to watch a game where the opposing team kept them on their heels to see if Jimmy G is capable of marshaling this offense outside of scheme.
