The Seattle Seahawks are virtually locked into the fifth seed of the National Football Conference. Pretty amazing feat given their low preseason expectations...

#### Quarterback: _Russell Wilson_

Russell Wilson has been up and down this season. His performance against the Chiefs last week was a throwback to the last couple years when he was undoubtedly an elite quarterback. But then watch his game against the Vikings and doubts begin to creep up about whether he's lose some of his touch.

Given his history though, I am willing to give the man the benefit of the doubt here. Not to mention that Pro Football Focus has him pegged as one of the most accurate quarterbacks this season, throwing deep passes with roughly 50% accuracy. His passer rating has been phenomenal as well. So the Seahawks can count on Russell Wilson as a strength heading into the postseason.

#### Offensive Weapons: _Chris Carson, Russell Wilson, Tyler Lockett_

It's unsurprising to see two rushers being deemed as the main offensive weapons given that the Seahawks are the one team in the league most committed to the run. With Chris Carson as its bell cow halfback and Russell Wilson as a mobile quarterback, Seattle has been frustrating defenses for the better part of the season with its multi-dimensional ground game. Pete Carroll has been relentless in his journey to bring back that run-first offense from the Seahawks championship years....and his efforts have finally bore fruit this season.

But on the other hand...the strong ground game comes at the expense of the passing game. It's not as prominent as it was the last couple years. And yet despite that, Tyler Lockett is having his best season in terms of raw yardage.  This offense loves its deep passing off play action, and the one receiver that can truly take advantage of these throws is the 4th-year speedster.
