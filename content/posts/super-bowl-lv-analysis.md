## Chiefs @ Buccaneers

Mahomes vs Brady. I didn't want this Super Bowl, but this is the one I got, unfortunately. Am I a little sad, sure? But at the same time, I could close out the season on a positive note after suffering through a whole bunch of lousy bets in these playoffs. Let's start.

***

### Buccaneers @ Falcons (Week 15)

Buccaneers love their screens - both wide receiver and conventional tailback screens.

Blitzes seem to be very effective against Brady. A whiff of pressure is enough to throw him off his game. On multiple occasions, the Falcons killed Tampa's drives with smartly-designed blitzes.

Leonard Fournette is for real. Him being a viable tailback has taken Atlanta by surprise.

Tampa Bay has been bailed out a few times by incredible catches or lucky penalties.

Sean Murphy-Bunting is a serious point of weakness in this secondary.

### Falcons @ Chiefs (Week 16)

Lots of two tailback sets with these Chiefs. Atlanta is doing a good job playing assignment football though.

Atlanta's defense seeing quite a bit of success using five and six-man defensive fronts. Their blitz packages have thrown Mahomes off his game too on a number of occasions.

Grady Jarrett has forced his way into the pocket on multiple occasions. Very talented player.

Once again, the Falcons are throwing all sorts of blitzes against the Chiefs and most of them seem to be working.

Interestingly enough, Atlanta borrowing quite a few offensive concepts from Kansas City in this game. Wide motioning, the shovel pass, etc.

The Chiefs are pretty good in preventing Atlanta's skill players from breaking tackles. Very necessary given how much man coverage they run.

Tershawn Wharton may be a key player for the Chiefs along their defensive line.

### Chiefs @ Ravens (Week 3)

The Ravens were pretty awful in coverage on the Chiefs first drive. Zone coverage is not something Baltimore runs gracefully.

It's clear the Ravens weren't ready for all the tricks the Chiefs love to run, especially with the skill players they were lining up at tight end. That and Tyreek Hill being able to play at different points in formation put too much stress on Baltimore's defensive unit.

Marcus Peters is a definite point of weakness in man coverage. Wouldn't be surprised to see Kansas pick on Jemel Dean in the same manner.

I'm not a fan of the Ravens running these replacement blitzes. These blitzes rely solely on confusion to hit home instead of numerical advantage or strategic strikes.

Tyreek Hill is such a difference maker even when he's used as a decoy. Baltimore's defense has gone out of its way to watch him, to the detriment of the rest of their coverage.

***

### Chiefs @ Buccaneers (Week 12)

Brady has a pathological dependance on Mike Evans.

Jason Pierre-Paul has been a beast so far.

Brady seems to select his targets before the flop.

Tampa Bay's zone coverage is pretty hopeless against Kansas. In fact, the Buccaneers are suspiciously playing a fair amount of zone coverage against the Chiefs.

Buccaneers love to stack their receivers two at a time at the line of scrimmage.

Tampa's zone coverage near the end of the first half was absolutely phenomenal.

The Buccaneers letting up two big end rushes against the Chiefs on a critical series.  A little worrying considering they forced Kansas into some serious negative game script. Even worse, the drive ended with a Tyreek Hill touchdown coming against single-safety coverage. Why the Buccaneers are insisting on running this traditional single-high look even in the second half is beyond me.

### Buccaneers @ Saints (Divisional Round)

Devin White has been highly effective as the fifth pass rusher on Tampa Bay's blitzing packages.

Sean Murphy-Bunting is now adding serious value to the Bucs secondary. Brees has made it a point to target the man in coverage and the kid has held up so far. He's also made a few impact plays.

...Then again, he's usually followed up those impact plays with boneheaded acts, so things have somewhat evened out with him. Still, better play than what I saw before in his game against the Falcons.

### Chiefs @ Saints (Week 15)

What a heads-up play by Frank Clark, peeling off his pass rush to chase after Alvin Kamara on a wheel route. In fact, it's only been one quarter, but the Chiefs defense have read the Saints pretty damn well so far. Whether it's dropping coverage assignments at the right moments or undercutting the routes their receivers are running, Kansas City has demonstrated to me an understanding of the New Orleans offense.

Kansas City's sticky man coverage is a thing of beauty.

Steve Spagnuolo gambling quite a bit with his jailbreak blitzes on third down. It's working though.

Once again, Kansas City running quite a few option plays coming out of the gate.
