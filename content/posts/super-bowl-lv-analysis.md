## Chiefs @ Buccaneers

Mahomes vs Brady. I didn't want this Super Bowl, but this is the one I got, unfortunately. Am I a little sad, sure? But at the same time, I could close out the season on a positive note after suffering through a whole bunch of lousy bets in these playoffs. Let's start.

### Buccaneers @ Falcons (Week 15)

Buccaneers love their screens - both wide receiver and conventional tailback screens.

Blitzes seem to be very effective against Brady. A whiff of pressure is enough to throw him off his game. On multiple occasions, the Falcons killed Tampa's drives with smartly-designed blitzes.

Leonard Fournette is for real.
