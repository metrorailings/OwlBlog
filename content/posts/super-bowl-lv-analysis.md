## Chiefs @ Buccaneers

Mahomes vs Brady. I didn't want this Super Bowl, but this is the one I got, unfortunately. Am I a little sad, sure? But at the same time, I could close out the season on a positive note after suffering through a whole bunch of lousy bets in these playoffs. Let's start.

***

### Buccaneers @ Falcons (Week 15)

Buccaneers love their screens - both wide receiver and conventional tailback screens.

Blitzes seem to be very effective against Brady. A whiff of pressure is enough to throw him off his game. On multiple occasions, the Falcons killed Tampa's drives with smartly-designed blitzes.

Leonard Fournette is for real. Him being a viable tailback has taken Atlanta by surprise.

Tampa Bay has been bailed out a few times by incredible catches or lucky penalties.

### Falcons @ Chiefs (Week 16)

Lots of two tailback sets with these Chiefs. Atlanta is doing a good job playing assignment football though.

Atlanta's defense seeing quite a bit of success using five and six-man defensive fronts. Their blitz packages have thrown Mahomes off his game too on a number of occasions.

Grady Jarrett has forced his way into the pocket on multiple occasions. Very talented player.

Once again, the Falcons are throwing all sorts of blitzes against the Chiefs and most of them seem to be working.

***

### Chiefs @ Ravens (Week 3)

The Ravens were pretty awful in coverage on the Chiefs first drive. Zone coverage is not something Baltimore runs gracefully.

It's clear the Ravens weren't ready for all the tricks the Chiefs love to run, especially with the skill players they were lining up at tight end. That and Tyreek Hill being able to play at different points in formation put too much stress on Baltimore's defensive unit.

Marcus Peters is a definite point of weakness in man coverage. Wouldn't be surprised to see Kansas pick on Jemel Dean in the same manner.

I'm not a fan of the Ravens running these replacement blitzes. These blitzes rely solely on confusion to hit home instead of numerical advantage or strategic strikes.

Tyreek Hill is such a difference maker even when he's used as a decoy. Baltimore's defense has gone out of its way to watch him, to the detriment of the rest of their coverage.

***

### Chiefs @ Buccaneers (Week 12)

Brady has a pathological dependance on Mike Evans.

Jason Pierre-Paul has been a beast so far.

Brady seems to select his targets before the flop.

Tampa Bay's zone coverage is pretty hopeless against Kansas.

Buccaneers love to stack their receivers by pairs at the line of scrimmage.
