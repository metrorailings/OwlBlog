## Chiefs @ Buccaneers

Mahomes vs Brady. I didn't want this Super Bowl, but this is the one I got, unfortunately. Am I a little sad, sure? But at the same time, I could close out the season on a positive note after suffering through a whole bunch of lousy bets in these playoffs. Let's start.

### Buccaneers @ Falcons (Week 15)

Buccaneers love their screens - both wide receiver and conventional tailback screens.

Blitzes seem to be very effective against Brady. A whiff of pressure is enough to throw him off his game. On multiple occasions, the Falcons killed Tampa's drives with smartly-designed blitzes.

Leonard Fournette is for real. Him being a viable tailback has taken Atlanta by surprise.

Tampa Bay has been bailed out a few times by incredible catches or lucky penalties.

### Falcons @ Chiefs (Week 16)

Lots of two tailback sets with these Chiefs. Atlanta is doing a good job playing assignment football though.

Atlanta's defense seeing quite a bit of success using five and six-man defensive fronts. Their blitz packages have thrown Mahomes off his game too on a number of occasions.

Grady Jarrett has forced his way into the pocket on multiple occasions.
