headline = "Super Bowl LVI: Pass Rush Analysis"

+++
Normally for the two teams in the Super Bowl, I watch games in which they share a common opponent to gauge their pass rush productivity. This year, I'll avoid watching games involving division rivals - the familiarity factor really screws things up. It's much better watching games in which the teams are playing against a common opponent that's not all too familiar with either team, in order to assess things as fairly as possible. 

### Rams @ Ravens

On the second half Raven drives, the Rams front generated six impactful plays, two attributable to coaching, one attributable to Aaron Donald, two tackles for loss courtesy of Greg Gaines, and one end-game sack from Von Miller.
