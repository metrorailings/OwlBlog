My favorite holiday of the year. Not because of the turkey or the food or anything, fuck that. It's all about having the day off to make bets on three consecutive primetime football games.

Let's look through each game and find some bets to like. I feel good about tomorrow's slate of games too.

#### Chicago Bears @ Detroit Lions (+2.5) (Point Total: 43.5)

The spread cleared past the key number of 3 earlier today as word finally got around that Mitch Trubisky was highly unlikely to play.

But would that really change much? Mitch Trubisky hasn't exactly been lighting the world on fire, despite what a quick glance over his numbers may initially indicate. His passing performance has been panned by analytical outlets and respectable commentators alike. What has been his saving grace has been his ability to run circles around defenders. And Chase Daniel doesn't have that talent, unfortunately. Nor is he much of a passer, obviously.

The Bears can still put up points courtesy of some fantastic scripted plays from Matt Nagy, but even he can only draw up so many plays before his well dries up.

Seems like a good time to bet on the Lions, no? Except the Lions will now be missing the services of **both** Marvin Jones and Kerryon Johnson. Kenny Galliday and Theo Riddick will now be the bellcows carrying Detroit's passing attack. And I'm not sure if that's enough to keep this game competitive against the NFL's best defense.

That under is looking sexy though...

**Bet: Under 43.5**

#### Washington Redskins @ Dallas Cowboys (-7) (Point Total: 40.5)

The books seem to think the Redskins will take a step back after Alex Smith's tragic season-ending injury last week. But Alex Smith was never a solid fit in the offensive system Jay Gruden was trying to institute. Colt McCoy, on the other hand, has demonstrated some comfort in Gruden's system. So it's very possible (even likely) that Washington will actually perform better with Colt McCoy at the helm of the offense. Last week actually showed the offense come alive a bit when Colt stepped in - his first pass was a touchdown throw to Jordan Reed.

On top of that, these Cowboys are a little overrated. That win over the Falcons last week was driven mostly by Ezekiel Elliott. And unlike Atlanta's bottom-ranked defense, the Redskins defense have some chops. Not to mention the Redskins boast a bunch of quality pass rushers that can force the easily-flustered Dak Prescott into throwing some bad passes.

**Bets: Redskins +7 & Redskins ML**

#### Atlanta Falcons @ New Orleans Saints (-13) (Point Total: 59.5)

I went into some length in a [post](https://www.owlpicks.com/posts/reviewing-atlanta-s-loss-against-the-cowboys/ "post") yesterday about why the Falcons stand a good chance of covering against the Saints. Towards the end of that post, I also alluded to the fact that both teams should be able to feast on scores. Atlanta is struggling badly against the run, which bodes well for a Saints team that loves to pound the ball on the ground. But at the same time, the Saints defense isn't really anything special. While their run defense has been quite good so far, their secondary needs some work. Marcus Lattimore has lost some of his magic this year. Eli Apple is shaping up into a decent cornerback, but he's only one man in a secondary that now lacks quality personnel in all other positions.

**Bets: Falcons +13 & Over 59.5**
