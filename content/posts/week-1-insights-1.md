#### Cowboys @ Buccaneers

Kudos to Kellen Moore for shelving the ground game against this historically great Tampa Bay defense. Its clear by Dak's stats alone that the Cowboys will be leaning almost entirely on the air game.

Amari Cooper is a weapon.

Gronk is a weapon.

DeMarcus Lawrence with a game-changing forced fumble. Undoubtedly Dallas' best defensive player.

Both Brady and Prescott looking good, making some throws under pressure. Dak in particular is impressing me, coming off serious injury in a road game against the reigning champions.

Dan Quinn experimenting with different concepts - cover zero blitz, two man pass rushes, etc. I wonder if he's finally evolved past a relentless focus on the cover-three defense.

CeeDee Lamb is a weapon.

#### Jets @ Panthers

New York expectedly making mistakes in its first drive.

Zach Wilson can run. And honestly, he's not afraid to throw deep.

Brian Burns and Carolina's defensive line is making mincemeat out of the offensive line.

Darnold is sloppy. I'd say Wilson is so far outperforming him. Shame.

I can't reiterate enough - Darnold is looking mad sloppy. Just inaccurate with his passes. Carolina's offense sees far more success when the ball is in Christian McCaffrey's hands and not Darnold's.

Beautiful play by Joe Brady, running a quarterback draw with Darnold from a 5-wide formation.

Punting from the Jets 33 in the first quarter. What a cowardly punt. It's clear Rhule wants to do everything in his power to make sure the Jets get no momentum, but punting from deep within opponent territory? Come on...

It seems Rhule was all too comfortable playing this game conservatively. Insisting on running the ball with McCaffrey into heavily-manned boxes, punting from the opponent 33-yard line, etc. Carolina nailed six sacks on first-time quarterback Zach Wilson and still only came away with a one-score margin win here.

#### Eagles @ Falcons

Falcons seem more inclined towards zone coverage.

Jalen Hurts rushing ability and a rub route from Devonta Smith were critical towards a touchdown.

Creative play design from Arthur Smith to convert a fourth down with one yard to go. Setting up play-action from a heavy formation and passing the ball to a tight end sliding off a block. 

Nick Sirianni looking intense on the sidelines.

Derek Barnett is a real gamer.

For one drive, the Falcons seem to have gained a beat on this Eagles offense, playing tight against the line of scrimmage. I love that Pees isn't afraid to fire off a blitz on long downs.

The Eagles are running the ball fairly effectively, especially in the hurry-up. This read-option threat with Hurts at quarterback is frustrating Atlanta.

On top of their run game, add in the screen game with Miles Sanders. Worth seeing if Dean Pees and his third down defense can be gutted with screen passes - on one third down, Pees completely vacated the flat, sending everybody in the box up against the blitz. It wasn't hard for an offensive line as talented as Philly's to guide Miles Sanders towards a first down.

#### Broncos @ Giants

Kadarius Toby being thrown in motion in all sorts of ways here by the Giants.

Giants are having trouble running the ball, but pass protection is looking better. It helps to have Barkley out there chipping the edge rushers. Giants were able to cash in on one drive with a deep pass to Sterling Shepard after the offensive line was able to hold up long enough against Denver's venerable pass rush.

Excellent call by Pat Shurmur on a third down, calling on Jerry Jeudy to run a dagger route against a zero-day blitz.

Teddy Bridgewater has been nearly perfect against this Giants defense. It's worrisome. This Giants pass coverage is just pathetic. Teddy is way too cool throwing the ball all over the field. Maybe the poor pass coverage is a consequence of not practicing enough in the summer?

This Giants pass rush is just....non-existant. Especially as their defense becomes more and more exhausted.

#### Browns @ Chiefs

The Chiefs defense has been absolutely gutless against Cleveland's creativity.  

Kansas' offensive line isn't ready for gametime. It's honestly going to take time for these players to find their groove. Until then, Patrick Mahomes will have to work harder than ever to keep the unit productive as the line in front of him cuts its teeth. 

Cleveland literally running at will. Backed up at the 2-yard line, it was obvious Cleveland was going to run the ball. Kansas still gave up 5 precious yards.

Cleveland's last drive of the first half stalled when Baker was asked to thow the ball four times consecutively. The Browns should have peppered in more exotic plays instead of calling on Mayfield to drop back and pass the ball.

Just like that, the Chiefs mount a comeback in the fourth quarter, ignited by a 75-yard bomb to Tyreek Hill. Never count the Chiefs out at Arrowhead!

Contrary to what Lombardi says, it's clear the Chiefs were not prepared for this game. It took a heroic comeback in the fourth quarter to nail a win against a team you've previously dominated. Not good.

#### Chargers @ Football Team

Washington clearly prefer running the ball over throwing it. Makes sense, given their air game so far has been pretty pathetic.

To be fair to Washington, Joey Bosa has been giving them fits.

Kudos to Justin Herbert for his accurate passing.

These Chargers receivers are running some crisp routes. Mike Williams and Keenan Allen are impressing in particular. 

I wonder if this referee crew even flags pass interference. Back-to-back plays with some arguable pass interference from Washington. Alex Kemp and his crew kept their yellow flags dry on both plays.

#### Bears @ Rams

Seems like Matthew Buttford will be just fine.

Jalen Ramsey is a real force on defense. More than happy making plays all over the field.

Chicago is quickly letting people know that it's possible to run the ball effectively on these Rams. What fascinates me about these Rams is that even though Brandon Staley is no longer with this team, his style of defense still guides this team's approach on that side of the ball. Raheem Morris is either content adopting that philosophy on defense or Sean McVay is mandating his defense keep Staley's ideology intact. 

Chicago's throwing linebacker blitzes at Matthew Stafford, but Stafford is doing well reading them and adjusting accordingly.

Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods do some good work producing yards after the catch.
