#### Cowboys @ Buccaneers

Kudos to Kellen Moore for shelving the ground game against this historically great Tampa Bay defense. Its clear by Dak's stats alone that the Cowboys will be leaning almost entirely on the air game.

Amari Cooper a weapon.

Gronk is a weapon.

DeMarcus Lawrence with a game-changing forced fumble.

Both Brady and Prescott looking good, making some throws under pressure.

Dan Quinn experimenting - cover zero blitz, two man pass rushes, etc.

CeeDee Lamb is a weapon.
