#### Cowboys @ Buccaneers

Kudos to Kellen Moore for shelving the ground game against this historically great Tampa Bay defense. Its clear by Dak's stats alone that the Cowboys will be leaning almost entirely on the air game.

Amari Cooper is a weapon.

Gronk is a weapon.

DeMarcus Lawrence with a game-changing forced fumble. Undoubtedly Dallas' best defensive player.

Both Brady and Prescott looking good, making some throws under pressure. Dak in particular is impressing me, coming off serious injury in a road game against the reigning champions.

Dan Quinn experimenting with different concepts - cover zero blitz, two man pass rushes, etc. I wonder if he's finally evolved past a relentless focus on the cover-three defense.

CeeDee Lamb is a weapon.

#### Jets @ Panthers

New York expectedly making mistakes in its first drive.

Zach Wilson can run. And honestly, he's not afraid to throw deep.

Brian Burns and Carolina's defensive line is making mincemeat out of the offensive line.

Darnold is sloppy. I'd say Wilson is so far outperforming him. Shame.

I can't reiterate enough - Darnold is looking mad sloppy. Just inaccurate with his passes. Carolina's offense sees far more success when the ball is in Christian McCaffrey's hands and not Darnold's.

Beautiful play by Joe Brady, running a quarterback draw with Darnold from a 5-wide formation.

Punting from the Jets 33 in the first quarter. What a cowardly punt. It's clear Rhule wants to do everything in his power to make sure the Jets get no momentum, but punting from deep within opponent territory? Come on...

It seems Rhule was all too comfortable playing this game conservatively. Insisting on running the ball with McCaffrey into heavily-manned boxes, punting from the opponent 33-yard line, etc. Carolina nailed six sacks on first-time quarterback Zach Wilson and still only came away with a one-score margin win here.

#### Eagles @ Falcons

Falcons seem more inclined towards zone coverage.

Jalen Hurts rushing ability and a rub route from Devonta Smith were critical towards a touchdown.

Creative play design from Arthur Smith to convert a fourth down with one yard to go. Setting up play-action from a heavy formation and passing the ball to a tight end sliding off a block. 

Nick Sirianni looking intense on the sidelines.

Derek Barnett is a real gamer.

For one drive, the Falcons seem to have gained a beat on this Eagles offense, playing tight against the line of scrimmage. I love that Pees isn't afraid to fire off a blitz on long downs.

The Eagles are running the ball fairly effectively, especially in the hurry-up. This read-option threat with Hurts at quarterback is frustrating Atlanta.

On top of their run game, add in the screen game with Miles Sanders. Worth seeing if Dean Pees and his third down defense can be gutted with screen passes - on one third down, Pees completely vacated the flat, sending everybody in the box up against the blitz. It wasn't hard for an offensive line as talented as Philly's to guide Miles Sanders towards a first down.

#### Broncos @ Giants

Kadarius Toby being thrown in motion in all sorts of ways here by the Giants.
