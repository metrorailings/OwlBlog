#### Cowboys @ Buccaneers

Kudos to Kellen Moore for shelving the ground game against this historically great Tampa Bay defense. Its clear by Dak's stats alone that the Cowboys will be leaning almost entirely on the air game.

Amari Cooper is a weapon.

Gronk is a weapon.

DeMarcus Lawrence with a game-changing forced fumble. Undoubtedly Dallas' best defensive player.

Both Brady and Prescott looking good, making some throws under pressure. Dak in particular is impressing me, coming off serious injury in a road game against the reigning champions.

Dan Quinn experimenting with different concepts - cover zero blitz, two man pass rushes, etc. I wonder if he's finally evolved past a relentless focus on the cover-three defense.

CeeDee Lamb is a weapon.

#### Jets @ Panthers

New York expectedly making mistakes in its first drive.

Zach Wilson can run. And honestly, he's not afraid to throw deep.

Brian Burns and Carolina's defensive line is making mincemeat out of the offensive line.

Darnold is sloppy. I'd say Wilson is so far outperforming him. Shame.

I can't reiterate enough - Darnold is looking mad sloppy. Just inaccurate with the passes.

#### Eagles @ Falcons

Falcons seem more inclined towards zone coverage.

Jalen Hurts rushing ability and a rub route from Devonta Smith were critical towards a touchdown.

Creative play design from Arthur Smith to convert a fourth down with one yard to go. Setting up play-action from a heavy formation and passing the ball to a tight end sliding off a block. 

Nick Sirianni looking intense on the sidelines.

Derek Barnett is a real gamer.
