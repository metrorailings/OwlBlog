## Texans @ Chiefs

Not a good offensive debut for a Texans team that was supposed to revamp following their trade of DeAndre Hopkins. Neither Brandon Cooks nor Randall Cobb really showed up tonight. Watson only posted 191 yards on passes tonight before garbage time really kicked in.

Some sloppy play from Texans right tackle Tytus Howard. Gave up quite a few pressures tonight.

Clyde Edwards-Helaire is impressive in his marquis NFL game. Breaking tackles, powering through defenders, accelerating rather quickly...he's doing good.

The addition of Kelechi Osemele on the Chiefs offensive line has been a pretty positive boon for the rushing attack.

Mahomes will never stop amazing me with his ability to throw under severe duress.

The Texans pass rush needs to be called into question here. Only J.J. Watt has showed up on multiple plays. Jacob Martin and P.J Hall may be players to watch down the line though.

Steve Spagnuolo's defense seems to have been inspired by Wade Phillips. His willingness to blitz and leave his backfield defenders in man situations should burn him quite a bit in pass coverage, but Chris Jones, Frank Clark, and Tyrann Matthieu have been able to ratchet the pressure on Deshawn Watson and throw him off his game.

## Bears @ Lions

Lions are an undisciplined bunch. Jamie Collins was kicked out for idiotically making contact with a referee. Cornerbacks are unnecessarily grabbing facemasks. Mitchell Trubisky is doing his damndest to give this game away and the Lions are simply unwilling to take the win.

I need to see why, but the Lions are choking away a three-score lead in the 4th quarter. What a lily-livered team. What kind of turd franchise allows a schmuck like Mitch Trubisky to stage a big comeback on the road?

Trubisky came back largely thanks to Detroit's laziness and lack of stamina. I can't emphasize the laziness point enough - the Lions are a gutless outfit. Talk about lacking the drive to win, let alone actively giving up on plays. On top of that, their conditioning is terrible.

## Dolphins @ Patriots

As expected, the Patriots are having fun leveraging Newton's athleticism on read-option plays and rushing packages.

80% of offensive plays for the Patriots have utilized play-action. Crazy. New England seems intent on defining its offense through Cam though.

New England using heavier personnel to run the ball even more effectively behind Cam.

N'Keal Harry finally turning into a playmaker now that Newton is directing this offense.

Miami's defense is better, but they're struggling with this new offense the Patriots are presenting. Still, their secondary and linebackers units look promising.

Miami not afraid to run cover zero.

***

## Buccaneers @ Saints

Buccaneers emphasizing the run over the pass here, opting to rush the ball nearly twice as much over the pass.

Brees and his short passes worry me. Usually, his age starts to show itself in the second half of the season.

The Buccaneers passing offense isn't anywhere near as crisp as I'd expect from a player of Tom Brady's caliber.

I wonder if a cover-two defense combined with chips off Alvin Kamara would be enough to cork this Saints offense.

Todd Bowles with his A-gap blitzes has been absolute money.

Trey Hendrickson showing up tonight as a capable pass rusher.

## Seahawks @ Falcons

Seattle's willingness to experiment with safety and linebacker blitzes is a game-changer for them.

Atlanta has a promising defensive line, though they are matching up against one of the league's weaker offensive lines.

Incredibly bold 4th down call from the Seahawks offensive coordinator. For once, Seattle may actually recognize Russell Wilson throwing the ball presents the best chance to win.

## Cowboys @ Rams

The Rams defense has found a creative way to open up pass rushing opportunities for Aaron Donald, having somebody else blitz alongside him in order to uncover any double teams.

The Rams have designed their offense to try and make it impossible to determine before the snap whether the Rams are throwing the ball or rushing. Their scripted plays have been pretty successful in illustrating this scheming.

Rams tight end Tyler Higbee may be a gamer.

Cowboys have a pretty solid offensive line. So do the Rams. Rams offensive line seem to have little issue executing on zone running concepts.

Los Angeles' offensive line deserves even more applause for their pass protection and run blocking.

Mike Nolan is finally sick of his defensive line not winning their battles along the trenches. The coordinator has called for quite a few more blitzes in order to rattle Jared Goff. And it's working.

Aldon Smith is a gamer.

***

## Steelers @ Giants

Daniel Jones actually playing well.

The Steelers doing excellent with their backfield penetrating on run plays.

Offensive line looks to be an issue YET AGAIN. Jason Garrett isn't doing much to help this line against the Steelers varied pass rush. Nor is the offensive line generating any actual push in the trenches on running downs.

The Giants and their three man pass rushes...lord help me.

The Steelers and their pass rush remain as ferocious as ever.

***

## Titans @ Broncos

Ryan Tannehill crisp and efficient conducting the 2-minute offense.

The Broncos have a truly stout defensive line and some elaborate complexity to their coverage schemes. It's what's keeping them in this game. Well, that and....

The Titans need to give Stephen Gostkowski a breather. Four straight missed kicks, three of them field goals. Shameful.

This Broncos offensive line needs to be called into question, particularly the tackles.

Melvin Gordon loves running laterally.

This Broncos offensive line is clearly not ready for the way the Titans defensive front likes to cut into gaps.
