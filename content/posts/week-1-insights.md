## Texans @ Chiefs

Not a good offensive debut for a Texans team that was supposed to revamp following their trade of DeAndre Hopkins. Neither Brandon Cooks nor Randall Cobb really showed up tonight. Watson only posted 191 yards on passes tonight before garbage time really kicked in.

Some sloppy play from Texans right tackle Tytus Howard. Gave up quite a few pressures tonight.

Clyde Edwards-Helaire is impressive in his marquis NFL game. Breaking tackles, powering through defenders, accelerating rather quickly...he's doing good.

The addition of Kelechi Osemele on the Chiefs offensive line has been a pretty positive boon for the rushing attack.

Mahomes will never stop amazing me with his ability to throw under severe duress.

The Texans pass rush needs to be called into question here. Only J.J. Watt has showed up on multiple plays. Jacob Martin and P.J Hall may be players to watch down the line though.

Steve Spagnuolo's defense seems to have been inspired by Wade Phillips. His willingness to blitz and leave his backfield defenders in man situations should burn him quite a bit in pass coverage, but Chris Jones, Frank Clark, and Tyrann Matthieu have been able to ratchet the pressure on Deshawn Watson and throw him off his game.

## Bears @ Lions

Lions are an undisciplined bunch. Jamie Collins was kicked out for idiotically making contact with a referee. Cornerbacks are unnecessarily grabbing facemasks. Mitchell Trubisky is doing his damndest to give this game away and the Lions are simply unwilling to take the win.
