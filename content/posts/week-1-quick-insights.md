## Chiefs @ Jaguars

The one team unable to handle the humidity in Jacksonville today were...the Jaguars. How? It seemed like the Kansas City players were having a merry old time playing out there in the searing heat while the Jaguars defenders were looking exhausted by the second quarter. How the hell is this even possible? Did these Jaguars never once practice outside during training camp? I just don't get it. But it's clear the humidity did kill any hope these Jaguars had at keeping the game close. Too many Jaguar defenders were whiffing on tackles and slow to react to the Chiefs and their offensive trickery. Not to mention all the penalties the team racked up over the course of the game.

Speaking of which, Myles Jack being ejected for throwing a punch doesn't sit well with me. The season's started and you already have a leader on this team causing unnecessary drama over something as menial as a push. Makes me wonder whether this team really learned its lesson from last year when the entire defense collectively lost its religion several weeks into the season.

Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye were giving up more receptions than stopping them. Not a good thing when your elite defensive backs are themselves making the case to no longer be considered elite.

Sammy Watkins shined today, especially in Tyreek Hill's absence.

## Giants @ Cowboys

Kellen Moore as offensive coordinator has been allowed to weave more creativity into the playbook, particularly when it comes to play-action concepts. It'll be interesting to see whether the Cowboys can continue executing on these concepts as the season goes on.

The Giants will likely have one of the worst defenses in the league. The secondary in particular played rough today - blown assignments and naïveté summed up their day (more or less). It also didn't help that the Giants were generating virtually zero pressure with their defensive front alone. Lorenzo Carter and Markus Golden were not able to win inside the trenches today. Blitzes were the only way Bettcher was able to pressure Dak from time to time. Unfortunately, blitzes only further exposed a defensive backfield playing out of its depth.

Eli Manning played far better than I expected, even connecting on a few big passes. I guess a better offensive line can go a long way towards helping a quarterback rebuild his confidence. Or maybe it's the fire that's lit under his ass knowing that his heir apparent stands on the sidelines waiting for his name to be called...

## Steelers @ Patriots

It looks like Pittsburgh will really end up missing the services of Antonio Brown. None of the other wide receivers seem to be stepping up outside of Juju Smith-Schuster to make up for the former Steeler's missed presence on the field.

Pittsburgh is still a bit slow at the linebacker position. New England is making a point of attacking these linebackers by running their halfbacks out of the backfield on routes.

The Patriots are truly a brilliant team. The quickness with which they can adjust on offense as opposing defense starts to adjust wows me. And that defensive line plays far better than the sum of its parts. It amazes me to see New England occasionally pressure the quarterback rushing only three defensive linemen. Generally, three-man rushes are doomed to fail.

New England will be goddamn scary on offense if they can work Josh Gordon and Antonio Brown into plays together.

## Bengals @ Seahawks

The Bengals are impressing me here. It's clear to me that Cincinnati is the better team. All the more remarkable too considering the team doesn't have many new faces on their roster. The new coaches have done some fantastic work breathing new life into a team many considered one of the worst franchises in professional football last year.

Speaking of which, I'm also impressed at the way Zac Taylor keeps himself composed standing on the sidelines. Never overly emotional, nor does he look out of his depth. Likewise, his defensive coordinator shares the same stoic demeanor. 

Andy Dalton looks far more comfortable in this offense, given the quickness of his passes and his overall composure in the pocket.

## 49ers @ Buccaneers

Tampa Bay cannot rely on either Demar Dotson or Donovan Smith as starting tackles. Especially because Winston tends to flinch every time an opposing pass rusher breathes on him. Unless Jameis manages to find inner peace real soon as the pocket crumbles around him, it's going to be a long season for this Buccaneers offense. I'm beginning to doubt whether Bruce Arians can turn Winston into a capable quarterback.

So far, the 49ers biggest additions to the defensive line have not disappointed. Dee Ford and Nick Bosa have been consistently winning their battles at the line of scrimmage. It helps that lining up in wide-nine stances forces Tampa Bay's tight ends to match up with them in pass protection sometimes, though I wonder if the Bucs' tight ends are honestly that much worser than the Bucs' tackles at holding back against edge rushers.

The 49ers pass coverage still remains problematic. Nothing better exemplifies this than the defense giving up 18 yards on a 3rd and 17 _while playing sticks coverage_. If San Francisco is to be effective on defense, then the defensive line will clearly be leading the way. Though the line's rushing defense is suspect as well, given the smaller size of the front.

Penalties ruled the day here. Alex Kemp and his coaching staff are a litigious bunch. Something worth keeping in mind for future bets.

## Texans @ Saints

Texans seem to prefer fielding two tight ends at once on offense.

More interesting though, Deshaun Watson turns his back when selling play-action. Opposing defenses can send cornerback blitzes to throw him off as soon as he turns back around. The Saints have done that successfully on a number of occasions.

The Saints clock management towards the end of the game was simply phenomenal. With only thirty or so seconds left, the Saints were able to matriculate the ball down the field for a game-winning field goal. The last time-out wasn't even burned until after the very last offensive play, giving the Saints the flexibility to throw the ball down the middle of the field if need be. The receivers were trained well too, going down quickly after catches in order to conserve as much time as possible.

Deandre Hopkins is a beast. Deshaun Watson is fantastic with the big throws. And the Texans seem to have gotten better with some of their offensive play-calling, even fooling the Saints defense on occasion with misdirection plays.

Alvin Kamara is simply irreplaceable.

## Titans @ Browns

The Browns are out of control. So many unnecessary penalties holding them back...

The Titans, on the other hand, are well-composed and play some sound (albeit boring) football. It seems as if the coaches trust Derrick Henry more than they trust Marcus Mariota.

Tennessee does have issues along the offensive line, as the Browns defensive front were constantly winning their battles in the trenches.

Speaking of which, Cleveland too has a major issue on their offensive line - their right tackle Hubbard. Just going by this game alone, I can tell Cleveland's tackles won't be doing Baker any favors this season.

Baker Mayfield made some good throws, though. The second-year passer still has some ways to go when it comes to decision-making and reading opposing defenses. Mayfield still needs more time leveling up.
