## Chiefs @ Jaguars

The one team unable to handle the humidity in Jacksonville today were...the Jaguars. How? It seemed like the Kansas City players were having a merry old time playing out there in the searing heat while the Jaguars defenders were looking exhausted by the second quarter. How the hell is this even possible? Did these Jaguars never once practice outside during training camp? I just don't get it. But it's clear the humidity did kill any hope these Jaguars had at keeping the game close. Too many Jaguar defenders were whiffing on tackles and slow to react to the Chiefs and their offensive trickery. Not to mention all the penalties the team racked up over the course of the game.

Speaking of which, Myles Jack being ejected for throwing a punch doesn't sit well with me. The season's started and you already have a leader on this team causing unnecessary drama over something as menial as a push. Makes me wonder whether this team really learned its lesson from last year when the entire defense collectively lost its religion several weeks into the season.

Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye were giving up more receptions than stopping them. Not a good thing when your elite defensive backs are themselves making the case to no longer be considered elite.

Sammy Watkins shined today, especially in Tyreek Hill's absence.

## Giants @ Cowboys

Kellen Moore as offensive coordinator has been allowed to weave more creativity into the playbook, particularly when it comes to play-action concepts. It'll be interesting to see whether the Cowboys can continue executing on these concepts as the season goes on.

The Giants will likely have one of the worst defenses in the league. The secondary in particular played rough today - blown assignments and naïveté summed up their day (more or less). It also didn't help that the Giants were generating virtually zero pressure with their defensive front alone. Lorenzo Carter and Markus Golden were not able to win inside the trenches today. Blitzes were the only way Bettcher was able to pressure Dak from time to time. Unfortunately, blitzes only further exposed a defensive backfield playing out of its depth.

Eli Manning played far better than I expected, even connecting on a few big passes. I guess a better offensive line can go a long way towards helping a quarterback rebuild his confidence. Or maybe it's the fire that's lit under his ass knowing that his heir apparent stands on the sidelines waiting for his name to be called...

## Steelers @ Patriots

It looks like Pittsburgh will really end up missing the services of Antonio Brown. None of the other wide receivers seem to be stepping up outside of Juju Smith-Schuster to make up for the former Steeler's missed presence on the field.

Pittsburgh is still a bit slow at the linebacker position. New England is making a point of attacking these linebackers by running their halfbacks out of the backfield on routes.

The Patriots are truly a brilliant team. The quickness with which they can adjust on offense as opposing defense starts to adjust wows me. And that defensive line plays far better than the sum of its parts. It amazes me to see New England occasionally pressure the quarterback rushing only three defensive linemen. Generally, three-man rushes are doomed to fail.

New England will be goddamn scary on offense if they can work Josh Gordon and Antonio Brown into plays together.
