### Bears @ Lions (-3)

> Lions -3

***

A pick loved by sharp folks everywhere, the Lions should be able to take this game and nail the cover with ease.  The Bears have the far better defense, sure...but the lack of preseason conditioning will leave them exhausted here as the game stretches into the third and fourth quarters. On top of that, the Lions actually have a top-flight quarterback, unlike the Bears. Coaching here is more or less a wash - Patricia and Nagy are a little too incompetent to gain an upper hand over one another here.

### Browns @ Ravens (-7.5)

> Ravens -7.5

***

Tall spread, but I'm banking on Stefansky messing up on his first real outing as an NFL head coach. The fact that his first game is against the league's hottest team last year only adds even more pressure.

I'm also banking on the Ravens largely picking up where they left off, considering most of their roster personnel and coaching staff have been left intact from last year. If Baltimore can spark its style of offense fairly quickly, Cleveland's undermanned defense won't be able to last the whole game.

### Colts @ Jaguars (+7.5)

> Colts -7.5

***

I'm not yet fully sold on this pick. It's almost guaranteed the Colts will win this one. It's just a matter of whether they can stave off the humidity down there in Jacksonville long enough to cover the spread. If the team ends up winding down early because of the weather, Gardner Minshew and the Jaguars offense may post just enough points to beat the spread.
