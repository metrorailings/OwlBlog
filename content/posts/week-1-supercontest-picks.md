### Bears @ Lions (-3)

> Lions -3

***

A pick loved by sharp folks everywhere, the Lions should be able to take this game and nail the cover with ease.  The Bears have the far better defense, sure...but the lack of preseason conditioning will leave them exhausted here as the game stretches into the third and fourth quarters. On top of that, the Lions actually have a top-flight quarterback, unlike the Bears. Coaching here is more or less a wash - Patricia and Nagy are a little too incompetent to gain an upper hand over one another here.

### Browns @ Ravens (-7.5)

> Ravens -7.5

***

Tall spread, but I'm banking on Stefansky messing up on his first real outing as an NFL head coach. The fact that his first game is against the league's hottest team last year only adds even more pressure.

I'm also banking on the Ravens largely picking up where they left off, considering most of their roster personnel and coaching staff have been left intact from last year. If Baltimore can spark its style of offense fairly quickly, Cleveland's undermanned defense won't be able to last the whole game.

***

### Colts @ Jaguars (+7.5)

> Colts -7.5

***

I'm not yet fully sold on this pick. It's almost guaranteed the Colts will win this one. It's just a matter of whether they can stave off the humidity down there in Jacksonville long enough to cover the spread. If the team ends up winding down early because of the weather, Gardner Minshew and the Jaguars offense may post just enough points to beat the spread. Coaching shouldn't make much a difference in this regard.

***

### Jets @ Bills (-6.5)

> Bills -6.5

***

Give me the Bills here. Home field mixed in with a clear coaching advantage should give them the victory here.

Still, the fact that they're going up against Sam Darnold gives me pause here. Darnold isn't an elite passer or anything, but he's no pushover either. Compared to Josh Allen, Darnold has more of the tools needed to be a successful quarterback. Still, those tools mean less if the Jets skill players fail to work in tandem with their quarterback.

### Seahawks @ Falcons (+1.5)

> Falcons +1.5

***

For the past several years under Pete Carroll, the Seahawks have been the poster child for underwhelming first-week performances. In fact, they were on a losing streak up until last year, when they managed to edge out the Bengals. The same Bengals that would later post the worst record of any team last year.

The last two years tell me Schottenheimer hasn't done much to change this trend.
