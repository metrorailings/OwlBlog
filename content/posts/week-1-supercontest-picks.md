### Bears @ Lions (-3)

> Lions -3

***

A pick loved by sharp folks everywhere, the Lions should be able to take this game and nail the cover with ease.  The Bears have the far better defense, sure...but the lack of preseason conditioning will leave them exhausted here as the game stretches into the third and fourth quarters. On top of that, the Lions actually have a top-flight quarterback, unlike the Bears. Coaching here is more or less a wash - Patricia and Nagy are a little too incompetent to gain an upper hand over one another here.
