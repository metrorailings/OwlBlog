Good week last week from a betting perspective, even if two of my Supercontest picks were losers. A superteaser hit landed me a pretty penny. Anyway...

##### _Saints_ (-6) @ Bengals

Give me the Saints all day long.

The Bengals biggest problem on offense has always been that they lack reliable weapons that have won the trust of their quarterback, Andy Dalton. And now you tell me his most trusted receiver in _AJ Green_ is out? I couldn't care less about Joe Mixon - AJ Green is fundamentally integral to this offense. Without him, Cincinnatti's passing game loses much more than a step.

The only thing that worries me is this potentially being a let-down spot for the Saints after two momentous wins against NFC heavyweights. But I'll chance it here with one of the NFL's more prolific offenses.

##### _Falcons_ (-5) @ Browns

I respect the Falcons and I respect that potent offense. But I disrespect the Browns so much more.
