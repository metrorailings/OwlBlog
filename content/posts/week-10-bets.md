Good week last week from a betting perspective, even if two of my Supercontest picks were losers. A superteaser hit landed me a pretty penny. Anyway...

##### _Saints (-6)_ @ Bengals

Give me the Saints all day long.

The Bengals biggest problem on offense has always been that they lack reliable weapons that have won over the trust of their quarterback, Andy Dalton. And now you tell me his _most trusted receiver in AJ Green_ is out? I couldn't care less about Joe Mixon - AJ Green is fundamentally integral to this offense. Without him, Cincinnatti's passing game loses much more than just a step.

The only thing that worries me is this potentially being a let-down spot for the Saints after two momentous wins against NFC heavyweights. But I'll chance it here with one of the NFL's more prolific offenses.

##### _Falcons (-5)_ @ Browns

I respect the Falcons and I respect their potent offense. But I disrespect the Browns so much more. The Browns had all the emotional fuel last week to cover against as 8-point underdogs against the Chiefs...and they still blow it.

The Browns will lose, with or without Hue Jackson. Losing is in their DNA this season. And even better, Gregg Williams seems intent on making sure the team stays true to their destiny this year.

##### Patriots @ _Titans (+6.5)_

Sure, the Titans come into this contest a little banged up off a short week, but I'll take my chances with Marcus Mariota and Mike Vrabel in Tennessee. This year's Patriots are not as intimidating as the Patriots of last year. More importantly, the team has played decisively worse on the road than at home.

The game will be decided on whether the Titans offensive line can hold Trey Flowers, Adrian Clayborn, and Deatrich Wise long enough for Marcus Mariota to throw some dimes.

##### Jaguars @ _Colts (-3)_ 

Interesting line. I used to be a big fan of the Jaguars earlier in the season, especially after they stomped the Patriots and Jets early in the season. But after that Chiefs game, the team has turned into an unmitigated disaster. Blake Bortles has regressed to joke form, the defense is tussling with one another in the locker room, defensive backs are doing some incredibly stupid things off the field, the coaches are not even fully aware of the injury situations of their starters...

On the other hand, the Colts are on the up-and-up, having lit up the scoreboards the last two weeks (albeit against incredibly poor competition). Two positive games hint at a trend, but a third solid game tells me that the team is for real. Given that Indy has Andrew Luck at quarterback and Frank Reich as head coach, I do believe this Colts team is for real.

#####  Cowboys @ _Eagles (-6.5)_

Not the biggest fan of this pick, but the Supercontest mandates I pick five games a week, and I like to pick teams led by a good head coach and a good quarterback. It also helps that the Eagles boast one of the best set of pass rushers in the league. And I'd much rather side with Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham matching up against a beleaguered Cowboys offensive front and a struggling quarterback.

Then again, I'm not liking these Eagles players constantly chirping about their distaste for the Cowboys. You're only giving Dallas more emotional fodder by being so public with your trash talk of the Ladyboys here.
