What a great week, though things were tense in the late afternoon games. The Packers were almost blanked out, but the defense kept forcing punts out of Kansas City, so it was only a matter of time before Jordan Love would string together just enough plays to score a touchdown. Thankfully, that touchdown netted them the cover.

If there's a lesson from last week, let's be fully aware teams have reached the point where effort levels dip. Buffalo, Dallas, New Orleans, and San Francisco losing last week stand as proof of this notion of midseason fatigue. Whenever teams perceive their next opponent as a pushover, consider that to be a potentially prime betting opportunity against that team.

### Packers @ Chiefs (-7.5)

#### _Latest Results_

**Patriots** @ Cardinals (TNF)  
Giants @ **Chiefs** (MNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

Aaron Rodgers is out of this game with COVID. I repeat, Aaron Rodgers is out for this game. Most other injuries seem trivial compared to that, no? That being said, Davante Adams returning to action should help out Jordan Love as he makes his first ever start.

Chiefs are fairly healthy.

#### _History_

Patrick Mahomes is not playing well. For whatever reason, the boy isn't in the right frame of mind for whatever reason. The Green Bay Packers aren't exactly a shabby defense known for surrendering easy yards either in the pass game - if Mahomes is to ever right the ship this season, it likely won't come against this Packer defense.

#### _Weather_

Cool windy day with clear skies

Packers +7.5

**Green Bay covers if**  
the offense doesn't lose much of its potency despite Jordan Love starting at quarterback. Certainly possible if Green Bay uses their smashing ground game to stay productive on offense while Love settles into the flow of things.

**Kansas City covers if**  
Green Bay loses most of its mojo on offense without its primary signal caller on the field  
\- OR -  
Joe Burry fails to adequately devote enough resources in coverage to Tyreek Hill  
\- OR -  
the offense finally kicks its addiction to big plays. Kansas can so easily move the ball by running more plays designed to net small yardage, but the Chiefs need to admit they have an addiction first before committing to an offense predicated to a more boring form of production.
