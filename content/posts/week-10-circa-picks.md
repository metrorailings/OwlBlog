What a great week, though things were tense in the late afternoon games. The Packers were almost blanked out, but the defense kept forcing punts out of Kansas City, so it was only a matter of time before Jordan Love would string together just enough plays to score a touchdown. Thankfully, that touchdown netted them the cover.

If there's a lesson from last week, it's that the season has reached a point where certain teams experience dips in effort levels. It's a phenomenon that we observe year in, year out. Buffalo, Dallas, New Orleans, and San Francisco losing in the manner they lost is proof that midseason fatigue has reared its ugly head. Whenever a team perceives its next opponent to be a pushover, consider that to be a potentially prime betting opportunity against that team.

#### _Latest Results_

**Falcons** @ Saints  
**Broncos** @ Cowboys

#### _Key Injuries_

No major injury worth noting, though it'll be useful to keep an eye on Dallas this week given they've been dealing with a number of nagging injuries on offense lately.

UPDATE: Randy Gregory will be out for the foreseeable future with a calf injury. With his loss, Dallas pass rush takes a major hit, though Quinn will likely try to mitigate that loss by rotating Micah Parsons more into an edge rushing role. Also, Tyron Smith remains a point of concern as he struggles with a bone spur.

Atlanta will almost certainly be missing an outside linebacker seen as a leader on defense.

#### _History_

Before going into any actual competitive history, it is worth noting Dan Quinn will be going up against the team that unceremoniously fired him last season. Any lingering ill will is only going to fuel Dallas here.

These two teams did face off against one another last year though in an early season game. Atlanta lit out early, running up a three score lead by halftime. The Falcons were so close to sewing up the game halfway through the fourth quarter, but had to settle for a chip-shot field goal. With the help of a successful onside kick, Dak Prescott and company were able to do just enough to win the game for Dallas.

#### _Weather_

Clear and lovely

Cowboys -9

**Dallas covers if**  
Dan Quinn and his defense are wholeheartedly motivated to dominate this game, given the recent history between Quinn and the Atlanta organization as well as the embarrassing loss last week to a Denver squad billed as double-digit underdogs  
\- OR -  
Dak Prescott and his receivers rediscover their groove on offense. In pursuit of this aim, Prescott and his receivers need to heal up some more over the week.

**Atlanta covers if**  
they dominate time of possession through Cordarelle Patterson and the ground game. This Falcon offensive line simply won't hold up in pass protection if the burden of production falls on Matt Ryan's shoulders, not against a Dallas defensive front that sells out hard to rush the passer.

### Browns @ Patriots (-1)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Browns** @ Bengals  
**Patriots** @ Panthers

#### _Key Injuries_

Patriots are dealing with a number of concussions, two of which are particularly concerning - one to Damien Harris and another to their hotshot kick returner Gunner Olsnewski.

Cleveland's cornerback situation is a point of caution now that Greedy Williams is dealing with some aggravated injuries of his own. It doesn't seem like those injuries should keep him out of this road trip to New England.

#### _History_

No recent history between Kevin Stefansky and Bill Belichick, but these two teams were adversaries two seasons ago. That game can only give us so much insight given that more than a year has passed and both teams have undergone serious changes since then. Cleveland now has a different coaching regime and the Patriots offense is no longer led by Tom Brady.

That being said, the Browns were able to push the ball against the Patriots, but early turnovers torpedoed any hopes of a Cleveland upset.

Both teams have simply been sensational running the ball. It's quite possible Cleveland and New England are the two best teams at rushing the ball. It works out very nicely for both teams considering neither organization has a quarterback capable of carrying an offense. Oddly enough, neither team has much of a rushing defense either, though both teams have been slowly improving in recent weeks. It remains to be seen whether this trend persists for either franchise going into this contest.

#### _Weather_

Starting to get cold. Weather is expected to be in the 40s.

Patriots +1

**New England covers if**  
their coaches outwit Cleveland's coaches. One could make a fair argument that Cleveland edges out New England in terms of roster talent, but their defensive coaching leaves so much to be desired. I simply don't see Joe Woods getting the better of Josh McDaniels, especially in Foxborough.

**Cleveland covers if**  
they can summon the same emotional high that carried them last week in a dominating win against Cincinnati. That high was partly fueled by the resentment following the ousting of Odell Beckham. I'm not sure if Cleveland can play at the same frenetic level after proving to the world that his presence on the team wasn't necessary  
\- OR -  
their roster advantage combined with a little bit of luck gives them the boost necessary to steal one from the Patriots.

### Buccaneers @ Washington (+9.5)

#### _Latest Results_

Buccaneers - BYE  
Washington - BYE

#### _Key Injuries_

Buccaneers are still likely to miss the services of Rob Gronkowski and Antonio Brown coming back from their bye week. Neither have started practicing as of Tuesday. On a positive note, starting corner Sean Murphy-Bunting and wide receiver Scotty Miller have decent chances at returning this Sunday after spending the past few weeks on injured reserve.

Washington seems to be in slightly better shape. Logan Thomas could potentially mark his grand return from injury this week. Brandon Scherff will likely see action too after being sidelined for multiple weeks.

#### _History_

Both of these teams met last year in the wild card round of the postseason in what ultimately ended up being a rout in favor of Tampa Bay. Even though Washington boasted one of the most feared defensive lines in the league, their defense was all but helpless against the richness of the Buccaneers offense.

This year, Washington's taken a major step back as it tries to indoctrinate a set of new defensive backs to man the backfield in pass coverage. The problem is that the personnel don't seem to fit the scheme. On top of that, Washington built its reputation last year facing off against a string of weak opponents. It's a luxury that's not there this season given their schedule.

#### _Weather_

Pretty chilly. Mid 40s.

Buccaneers -9.5

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
Brady and his receivers once again stack up yardage against a Washington defense that hasn't really proven itself in pass coverage  
\- AND -  
their defense stalls Washington's offense on at least two-thirds of their drives  
\- AND -  
the sudden shift in weather doesn't rattle them as they work to regain their rhythm on both sides of the ball.

**Washington covers if**  
the team comes out of the bye with a great game plan against the Buccaneers. Ideally, the plan should involve mixed looks in pass coverage as well as increased tempo on offense. But honestly, it would amaze me if Washington's coaches actually came to the game with a plan at all. Nothing fancy, just something indicating a few thoughts were strung together.

### Seahawks @ Packers (-3.5)

#### _Latest Results_

Seahawks - BYE  
Packers @ **Chiefs**

#### _Key Injuries_

Left tackle David Bakhtiari is eligible to return back to action this Sunday. But more importantly, Green Bay will almost certainly see Aaron Rodgers mark his glorious return from infamy. Sure, his reputation may have taken a hit with all of his COVID nonsense, but it's abundantly clear the Packers need him in the worst way imaginable - Jordan Love is what a white flag would look like if it assumed human form. Green Bay can't afford to start him again, period.

Likewise, Seattle will welcome Russell Wilson back from injured reserve. On top of that, Chris Carson and rookie wide receiver Dee Eskridge are expected back as well. Seattle's offense should see a marked improvement in offense so long as all three see some significant snaps this week.

#### _History_

Last time these two teams squared off, it was the 2019 postseason. Despite the final score, Rodgers and LaFleur had little problem maintaining wrist control over Russell and Pete Carroll.

Since then, Green Bay has progressed forward offensively and defensively. Seattle, though...they haven't improved much - the team still finds itself getting jammed up all too easily in ruts. One thing for certain this year is that Seattle's pass defense has been pathetic. Part of the reason why is that none of the pass rushers have really stepped up. Darrell Taylor has impressed as of late though, so it's possible the Seahawks may be turning a leaf there. We'll know for sure over the next couple weeks.

#### _Weather_

Pretty damn cold. Wisconsin has begun its transformation into a tundra now that winter has arrived.

**Green Bay covers if**  
Aaron Rodgers can reignite this offense against a middling Seattle defense  
\- AND -  
Green Bay can maintain some production on the ground against Seattle's heavy defensive front.

**Seattle covers if**  
Russell Wilson and his explosive playmakers can keep pace with Green Bay's prodigious offense.

### Chiefs @ Raiders (+2.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Packers @ **Chiefs**  
Raiders @ **Giants**

#### _Key Injuries_

The Chiefs are dealing with health issues to two of their offensive linemen, though it's likely things will improve for at least one of them by the end of the week.

For Las Vegas, it's worth keeping a keen eye on Hunter Renfrow. Without Henry Ruggs, Renfrow and Darren Waller are all the more important as the major remaining weapons for Derek Carr in the passing game.

#### _History_

Dating back the past few years, the Raiders tend to play Kansas with a little more ferocity than their other opponents. But that fervor came with Jon Gruden at head coach. It remains uncertain whether Vegas can summon that same energy now that Gruden has been removed from the organization. On top of that, the Chiefs are no longer the Goliath of the division. If anything, it's quite possible Kansas may well be the worst team in the division. It's remarkable how quickly the Chiefs have fell from grace now that Mahomes and his offense have completely lost their collective mojo.

Still, last year's games do provide some valuable insight here. In both games, the Raiders played the Chiefs tough. In the first match, Vegas pulled off the upset as double-digit underdogs. In the later match, Kansas pulled out the win, but to say it was an easy victory would be incredibly foolish - the Raiders fought tooth and nail to run the sweep, but Mahomes played too sensationally for them.

#### _Weather_

Raiders +2.5

***

**Las Vegas covers if**  
Derek Carr outplays Patrick Mahomes. Part of that will depend on whether the Raiders stay committed to the same type of defense that paid off tremendously for them last year and for so many other teams this season.

**Kansas City covers if**  
their win last week is that positive impetus they need to motivate them into playing much better. It's not easy rediscovering your groove in enemy territory, so any little bit of positive momentum that can be carried over from that win will serve them well  
\- AND -  
Hunter Renfrow or Darren Waller aren't fully healthy, impacting their performance on the field. The Vegas offense lost a big part of itself now that Henry Ruggs is riding the short bus over to his new home at the state penitentiary, so Renfrow and Waller need to play at a high-enough level to give Carr options in the passing attack.

### Rams @ 49ers (+4)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Titans__ @ Rams (SNF)**  
Cardinals** @ 49ers

#### _Key Injuries_

Los Angeles is mostly healthy. Injuries haven't been much a concern for them this season.

The 49ers, on the other hand, are the walking wounded. Foundational players on both sides of the ball are out for the season or playing in limited capacity. The biggest concern might be running back JaMycal Hasty, who hasn't practiced this week.

#### _History_

As bad as the 49ers were last year, they still managed to sweep the Rams last year. The same Rams who advanced to the division round last year. Few people can dissect this Los Angeles team better than Kyle Shanahan. In the first match, Shanahan forced the ball down the field through outside runs. In the rematch, Shanahan once again found success running the ball through the C gaps, but the defensive line also stepped up tremendously, cutting short Ram drives by either stuffing runs or harassing Goff into some ill-advised decisions.

This year, both teams will have better quarterbacks marshaling their offenses. One may argue that the Rams have the better quarterback, but it's a debatable assertion for the time being, especially after witnessing the way the Titans dismantled the Los Angeles offense last week.

#### _Weather_

49ers +4

***

**San Francisco covers if**  
the Rams once again fall prey to their devious combination of outside runs and counter zone plays. It's worth noting the Rams have been worse defending the run this year compared to last year.

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Matthew Stafford, perhaps emotionally motivated by a humiliating performance last week, plays at an exemplary level, finally justifying why the Rams were right to sacrifice multiple first-round picks in order to sign him in the offseason  
\- OR -  
the 49ers once again play as soft as they played last week, coughing up the ball at the worst possible moments and giving the Rams way too many opportunities to build a lead.
