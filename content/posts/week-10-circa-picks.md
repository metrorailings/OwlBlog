What a great week, though things were tense in the late afternoon games. The Packers were almost blanked out, but the defense kept forcing punts out of Kansas City, so it was only a matter of time before Jordan Love would string together just enough plays to score a touchdown. Thankfully, that touchdown netted them the cover.

If there's a lesson from last week, it's that the season has reached a point where certain teams experience dips in effort levels. It's a phenomenon that we observe year in, year out. Buffalo, Dallas, New Orleans, and San Francisco losing in the manner they lost is proof that midseason fatigue has reared its ugly head. Whenever a team perceives its next opponent to be a pushover, consider that to be a potentially prime betting opportunity against that team.

### Falcons @ Cowboys (-9)

#### _Latest Results_

**Falcons** @ Saints  
**Broncos** @ Cowboys

#### _Key Injuries_

No major injury worth noting, though it'll be useful to keep an eye on Dallas this week given they've been dealing with a number of nagging injuries on offense lately.

#### _History_

Before going into any actual competitive history, it is worth noting Dan Quinn will be going up against the team that unceremoniously fired him last season. Any lingering ill will is only going to fuel Dallas here.

These two teams did face off against one another last year though in an early season game. Atlanta lit out early, running up a three score lead by halftime. The Falcons were so close to sewing up the game halfway through the fourth quarter, but had to settle for a chip-shot field goal. With the help of a successful onside kick, Dak Prescott and company were able to do just enough to win the game for Dallas.

Clear and lovely

Cowboys -9

**Dallas covers if**  
Dan Quinn and his defense are wholeheartedly motivated to dominate this game, given the recent history between Quinn and the Atlanta organization as well as the embarrassing loss last week to a Denver squad billed as double-digit underdogs  
\- OR -  
Dak Prescott and his receivers rediscover their groove on offense. In pursuit of this aim, Prescott and his receivers need to heal up some more over the week.

**Atlanta covers if**  
they dominate time of possession through Cordarelle Patterson and the ground game. This Falcon offensive line simply won't hold up in pass protection if the burden of production falls on Matt Ryan's shoulders, not against a Dallas defensive front that sells out hard to rush the passer.

### Browns @ Patriots (-1)

#### _Latest Results_

**Browns** @ Bengals  
**Patriots** @ Panthers

#### _Key Injuries_

Patriots are dealing with a number of concussions, two of which are particularly concerning - one to Damien Harris and another to their hotshot kick returner Gunner Olsnewski.

Cleveland's cornerback situation is a point of caution now that Greedy Williams is dealing with some aggravated injuries of his own. It doesn't seem like those injuries should keep him out of this road trip to New England.

#### _History_

No recent history between Kevin Stefansky and Bill Belichick, but these two teams were adversaries two seasons ago. That game can only give us so much insight given that more than a year has passed and both teams have undergone serious changes since then. Cleveland now has a different coaching regime and the Patriots offense is no longer led by Tom Brady.

That being said, the Browns were able to push the ball against the Patriots, but early turnovers torpedoed any hopes of a Cleveland upset.

Both teams have simply been sensational running the ball. It's quite possible Cleveland and New England are the two best teams at rushing the ball. It works out very nicely for both teams considering neither organization has a quarterback capable of carrying an offense. Oddly enough, neither team has much of a rushing defense either, though both teams have been slowly improving in recent weeks. It remains to be seen whether this trend persists for either franchise going into this contest.

#### _Weather_

Starting to get cold. Weather is expected to be in the 40s.

Patriots +1

**New England covers if**  
their coaches outwit Cleveland's coaches. One could make a fair argument that Cleveland edges out New England in terms of roster talent, but their defensive coaching leaves so much to be desired. I simply don't see Joe Woods getting the better of Josh McDaniels, especially in Foxborough.

**Cleveland covers if**  
they can summon the same emotional high that carried them last week in a dominating win against Cincinnati. That high was partly fueled by the resentment following the ousting of Odell Beckham. I'm not sure if Cleveland can play at the same frenetic level after proving to the world that his presence on the team wasn't necessary  
\- OR -  
their roster advantage combined with a little bit of luck gives them the boost necessary to steal one from the Patriots.

### Buccaneers @ Washington (+9.5)

Buccaneers - BYE  
Washington - BYE

#### _Key Injuries_

Buccaneers are still likely to miss the services of Rob Gronkowski and Antonio Brown coming back from their bye week. Neither have started practicing as of Tuesday. On a positive note, starting corner Sean Murphy-Bunting and wide receiver Scotty Miller have decent chances at returning this Sunday after spending the past few weeks on injured reserve.

Washington seems to be in slightly better shape. Logan Thomas could potentially mark his grand return from injury this week.

#### _History_

Both of these teams met last year in the wild card round of the postseason in what ultimately ended up being a rout in favor of Tampa Bay. Even though Washington boasted one of the most feared defensive lines in the league, the defense was virtually helpless against the richness of the Buccaneers offense.
