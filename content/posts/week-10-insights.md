## Eagles @ Giants

Miles Sanders is truly a difference maker for this offense. His runs are somehow more explosive. Maybe it's his vision that gives the Eagles life in their ground game.

Bradberry may be a pretty good corner after all.

The Giants seem to now be relying on shorter passes and quicker plays. It's working - the Eagles defense don't have the speed to defend the short game.

Brandon Graham is truly be the best defensive player on the Eagles.

Sloppy penalties from Philadelphia.

The Giants may have issues containing runs with just their defensive front line. That or they have trouble handlings outside runs, something that may well be an indictment on their outside linebackers.

Daniel Jones did not turn over the ball once. Easily the most impressive stat of the game.

Jalen Reagor and Alshon Jeffery contributed nothing to the Eagles offense. Fascinating.

## Texans @ Browns

Houston moving the ball with short plays and misdirection run plays.

Deshaun Watson can be a magician in the pocket sometimes with his ability to navigate around pressure and throw balls.

## Bills @ Cardinals

Shit preparation and play-calling on the Cardinals second drive. Starting to question Kliff Kingsbury.

Cardinals are still sloppy with penalties. The penalties are what killed them last week.

I guess we'll have to wait until the second half to see if the Cardinals start throwing deep balls against the Bills and their second-string corners.

Arizona not shy about using the hurry-up offense early and intermittently.

Tyler Bass coming through with two huge field goals to keep Buffalo a full score ahead of the Cardinals through the first half.

Arizona is legitimately unprepared. Kliff Kingsbury isn't a details type of guy, apparently. The offense out there looking at the sideline in bewilderment.

Murray's short stature working against him here, as his balls have been batted down twice on successive plays.

Buffalo adjusted in the second half with quick throws. Quick throws pretty much render defensive back blitzes impotent.

Arizona is such a sloppy team. Lack of discipline, no commitment to securing the ball. 

Josh Allen throws the ball with such velocity some times that it's hard to intercept his passes.

Let it be known that Kliff Kingsbury is a bad coach. Never trust Kliff against good coaches like Brian Flores and Sean McDermott.

## 49ers @ Saints

Saints defense very aggressive in opening drive.

I'm thinking Jordan Reed is an adequate replacement for their beloved tight end George Kittle. He's been instrumental on a few plays and made a sick catch on a third down.

Big stop by the Saints defensive front on a critical fourth down. Onyemata busted through the offensive line to cut short a power run.

Alvin Kamara still the best halfback in the league, bar none. Dalvin Cook and Nick Chubb are distant runner-ups.

The defensive line of the Saints making some of the key plays needed to kill these 49er drives.

The Saints and their nickel blitzes have been absolute money against the 49ers.

## Ravens @ Patriots

New England now running the ball more with Cam on purpose.
