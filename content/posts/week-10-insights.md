## Eagles @ Giants

Miles Sanders is truly a difference maker for this offense. His runs are somehow more explosive. Maybe it's his vision that gives the Eagles life in their ground game.

Bradberry may be a pretty good corner after all.

The Giants seem to now be relying on shorter passes and quicker plays. It's working - the Eagles defense don't have the speed to defend the short game.

Brandon Graham is truly be the best defensive player on the Eagles.

Sloppy penalties from Philadelphia.

The Giants may have issues containing runs with just their defensive front line. That or they have trouble handlings outside runs, something that may well be an indictment on their outside linebackers.

Daniel Jones did not turn over the ball once. Easily the most impressive stat of the game.

Jalen Reagor and Alshon Jeffery contributed nothing to the Eagles offense. Fascinating.

## Texans @ Browns

Houston moving the ball with short plays and misdirection run plays.

Deshaun Watson can be a magician in the pocket sometimes with his ability to navigate around pressure and throw balls.

## Bills @ Cardinals

Shit preparation and play-calling on the Cardinals second drive. Starting to question Kliff Kingsbury.
