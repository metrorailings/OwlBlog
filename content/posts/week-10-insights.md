## Eagles @ Giants

Miles Sanders is truly a difference maker for this offense. His runs are somehow more explosive. Maybe it's his vision that gives the Eagles life in their ground game.

Bradberry may be a pretty good corner after all.

The Giants seem to now be relying on shorter passes and quicker plays. It's working - the Eagles defense don't have the speed to defend the short game.

Brandon Graham is truly be the best defensive player on the Eagles.

Sloppy penalties from Philadelphia.

The Giants may have issues containing runs with just their defensive front line.
