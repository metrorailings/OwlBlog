## Bills @ Browns

Finally, Baker is re-establishing a rapport with Jarvis Landry.

Three downs to move the ball one yard in order to keep the chains moving. Kitchens opts for three straight passing plays, despite having one of the best halfbacks in the game. Only on the fourth down do you try play action. Amazing.

Cleveland's offensive line cannot play power football. Six rushes roughly three or less yards away from the goal line and the Browns were hopeless on just about every single run, especially against a team that has not been so stout against the rush.

Bills are dangerous with their designed quarterback runs. Two big runs on one drive led to a touchdown.

The Browns' goal-to-go play package may have been deciphered by this Bills defense. Cleveland is just absolutely hopeless when just a few yards away from the goal line.

Baker Mayfield is overrated. Not only that, but this Cleveland has screwed up now on two forward pitches, something science initially deemed impossible. I'm never betting on this Browns team again.

## Giants @ Jets

Jets using zone blitzes to try and confuse Daniel Jones. We'll see wether Jones can weather Gregg Williams' trickery.

## Rams @ Steelers

The Steelers seem to like to spread their linebackers out towards the edge of the tackle box, leaving the defense more vulnerable to runs up the middle.

The Rams defense is intent on having the Steelers play from negative game script. Apparently, Los Angeles is convinced Mason Rudolph and the offense struggle to recover from negative plays.

Mason Rudolph himself has acknowledged his own inability to throw the deep pass. So far though, it seems the man is making more of an effort to generate more air yards, committing himself more to throwing intermediate routes.

McVay's self-scouting is to be taken with a grain of salt. His unwillingness to really change his system up much during the offseason is testament enough that the Rams lack the willpower to truly change and remain ahead of the curve.

Clay Matthews stepping up as the complimentary pass rusher to Aaron Donald.

## Vikings @ Cowboys

Cowboys relying on dropback passing to matriculate the ball instead of play-action and runs.

Screens are eviscerating this Cowboys defense. The Vikings are taking advantage of this overzealous Cowboys defensive front.

Mike Hughes staking his name as the best cornerback on this Vikings secondary.

Worth noting that slight pressure from Michael Bennett threw Cousins off on a big play.

Harrison Smith is the featured blitz defender for the Vikings.

Vikings are committed to their plan of stopping Zeke first and foremost. By large, the Cowboys' success on offense has come courtesy of Dak Prescott. Let's see if the Cowboys smarten up and counter through carefully executed play-action concepts.

Poor decision by Kirk Cousins on a free play. Worrisome.

Amari Cooper with his toe-tap receptions is damn near magical.

The Vikings deciphered the Cowboys and their running game. Zeke was neutered here. Other coaches should be looking at this game as a template on how to stop the Cowboys from rushing the ball at will.

## Seahawks @ 49ers

Seahawks coming out strong with the press coverage.

Jadaveon Clowney stepping up and not falling for any of the trickery of the 49ers offense.

49ers making money off slants against Seattle's man coverage.

Jimmy Garoffalo is sailing his passes tonight. His errant passing is throwing this game for the 49ers.

## Cardinals @ Buccaneers

The Cardinals have been wowing me with initial set of misdirection plays on their first drive.

But then in the red zone, things quickly fall apart. For some reason, Arizona lacks imagination when it comes to red zone plays. Their season red zone scoring percentage seems to be a testament to this.
