## Bills @ Browns

Finally, Baker is re-establishing a rapport with Jarvis Landry.

Three downs to move the ball one yard in order to keep the chains moving. Kitchens opts for three straight passing plays, despite having one of the best halfbacks in the game. Only on the fourth down do you try play action. Amazing.

Cleveland's offensive line cannot play power football. Six rushes roughly three or less yards away from the goal line and the Browns were hopeless on just about every single run, especially against a team that has not been so stout against the rush.

Bills are dangerous with their designed quarterback runs. Two big runs on one drive led to a touchdown.

The Browns' goal-to-go play package may have been deciphered by this Bills defense. Cleveland is just absolutely hopeless when just a few yards away from the goal line.

Baker Mayfield is overrated. Not only that, but this Cleveland has screwed up now on two forward pitches, something science initially deemed impossible. I'm never betting on this Browns team again.

## Giants @ Jets

Jets using zone blitzes to try and confuse Daniel Jones. We'll see wether Jones can weather Gregg Williams' trickery.
