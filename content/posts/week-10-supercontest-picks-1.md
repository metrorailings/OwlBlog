My picks last week were a mixed bag. Three picks were on the money, as my assumptions were mostly on point, especially when it came to the Carolina-Kansas City game - the Panthers had little trouble covering the spread after dominating time of possession. My Raiders pick was also correct, although to be honest, they were lucky to win that game. Vegas didn't do anything in the fourth quarter to show me they deserved the win.

My assumptions on two of the games were wildly off though. I didn't expect Tua to play at such a high level after his tragic performance last week. Arizona ran up the score against a stingy Miami defense, but Tua was able to match Miami blow-for-blow. The other game where my assumptions fell stupidly flat was the Saints-Buccaneers game, oddly enough the one game I was the most sure about. I honestly saw no way the Buccaneers could lose this game. But lose they did.

I learned to never underestimate good coaches in perceivably tough situations. I also learned the fighting spirit isn't easy to foster in a team that's been hyped up to stratospheric heights the past few weeks. Tampa Bay read way too many of its press clippings lately. It didn't really bother to present anything new to an opponent that literally broke them down earlier in the season. Honestly, I'd say New Orleans was overly prepared against a Buccaneers team running the same tired tricks all year.

Be careful picking hyped favorites.

### Texans @ Browns (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Texans** (27) @ Jaguars (25)  
BYE - **Raiders** (16) @ Browns (6)

#### _Record_

Texans (2-6)  
Browns (5-3)

#### _Injuries_

For the Texans, their starting left guard has been ruled out. Concerning for a team that struggles enough as is protecting their quarterback.

The Browns are in better shape, though a few pieces of their offensive line remain beat up. Nick Chubb may quite possibly make his return this week after being sidelined the past couple weeks. Should he be activated, his snaps will likely be heavily limited, so his impact on the game will likely be minimal.

#### _History_

Every time the Texans face a team that love to run the ball, it doesn't end well. Baltimore, Minnesota, and Tennessee have consistently shown this Texans defense to be nothing but frauds when it comes to stopping the run.

Similarly, the Browns have their own demons when it comes to pass coverage. Cleveland hasn't really shown itself very capable of shutting down capable passers, as we saw in their two contests against the Bengals. So Deshaun Watson and his ragtag band of receivers should have their moments against this shoddy Cleveland secondary. Then again, their sad outing against Jacksonville last week doesn't inspire much confidence - the Texans as a whole are an organization in serious need of outside intervention.

#### _Weather_

Cool 50-degree weather, but dangerous winds will be ripping across Cleveland on game day.

Browns -3

***

**Cleveland covers if**  
The Browns run roughshod all over Houston's demoralized defense.

**Houston covers if**  
Deshaun Watson and his receivers play at a high level in spite of the wind. To this end, Duke Johnson starting at tailback instead of David Johnson should help.

### 49ers @ Saints (-9)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Packers** (34) @ 49ers (17)  
**Saints** (38) @ Buccaneers (3)

#### _Record_

49ers (4-5)  
Saints (6-2)

#### _Injuries_

The 49ers are dangerously thin at wide receiver, though Richie James and Brandon Aiyuk are expected to play. Besides that, the 49ers will not have their primary nickel cornerback as well.

The Saints are fairly healthy.

#### _History_

Last year, these two teams met in Louisiana and it was a surprising shoot-out. I don't expect the same fireworks to pop off given Nick Mullens is starting at quarterback now for San Francisco. Still, the 49ers were able to key in on some of the Saints weaknesses on defense, namely the tendency among their cornerbacks to play outside leverage. San Francisco's weapons made some serious hay with sharp in-breaking routes. On top of that, their running backs also rattled off some lovely yardage, due largely to the struggles the Saints defense have handling outside zone runs.

Still, Brees ran up the score too against a defense many considered to be the best in the league. It was very unexpected. One thing I noted was that the 49ers weren't able to pressure Brees much.

***

49ers +9

***

**San Francisco covers if**  
the 49ers draw on last year's game plan to put some scores up against a Saints team caught slacking off a momentous win last week.

**New Orleans covers if**  
their defensive line overwhelms Nick Mullins and forces him into some terrible decisions.  
\- OR -  
An injury completely exposes San Francisco's lack of depth at receivers.

### Eagles @ Giants (+3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

BYE - Cowboys (9) @ **Eagles** (23)  
**Giants** (23) @ Washington (20)

#### _Record_

Eagles (3-4-1)  
Giants (2-7)

#### _Injuries_

Philadelphia comes into this game about as healthy as can be. Alshon Jeffery, Jalen Reagor, Dallas Goedert, and Miles Sanders are expected to return back into action - their return should elevate this offense, theoretically.

The Giants will be missing a starting cornerback in Isaac Yiadom. A rookie will likely take his place.

#### _History_

These two teams met just two weeks ago. The Giants, despite only keeping the for about 27 minutes, should have won this game. If it wasn't for Carson Wentz's heroics and Evan Engram's laziness, New York would possibly be on top of the division right now.

But Philadelphia was without most of their hyped weapons. This Sunday, the team will see many of them return back to action. What difference that makes remains to be seen though, as those weapons are only effective so long as Carson Wentz plays well.

#### _Weather_

Cool weather with some wind.

***

Giants +3.5

***

**New York covers if**  
the Giants can run the ball with some efficiency and Daniel Jones doesn't turn over the ball more than once.

**Philadelphia covers if**  
the combination of Alshon Jeffery, Miles Sanders, Jalen Reagor, and Dallas Goedert gives this offense some much-needed life.  
\- OR -  
their defensive line can force ugly turnovers from Daniel Jones.
