headline = "Week 10 Supercontest Picks"

+++
My picks last week were a mixed bag. Three picks were on the money, as my assumptions were mostly on point, especially when it came to the Carolina-Kansas City game - the Panthers had little trouble covering the spread after dominating time of possession. My Raiders pick was also correct, although to be honest, they were lucky to win that game. Vegas didn't do anything in the fourth quarter to show me they deserved the win.

My assumptions on two of the games were wildly off though. I didn't expect Tua to play at such a high level after his tragic performance last week. Arizona ran up the score against a stingy Miami defense, but Tua was able to match Miami blow-for-blow. The other game where my assumptions fell stupidly flat was the Saints-Buccaneers game, oddly enough the one game I was the most sure about. I honestly saw no way the Buccaneers could lose this game. But lose they did.

I learned to never underestimate good coaches in perceivably tough situations. I also learned the fighting spirit isn't easy to foster in a team that's been hyped up to stratospheric heights the past few weeks. Tampa Bay read way too many of its press clippings lately. It didn't really bother to present anything new to an opponent that literally broke them down earlier in the season. Honestly, I'd say New Orleans was overly prepared against a Buccaneers team running the same tired tricks all year.

Be careful picking hyped favorites.

### Texans @ Browns (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Texans** (27) @ Jaguars (25)  
BYE - **Raiders** (16) @ Browns (6)

#### _Record_

Texans (2-6)  
Browns (5-3)

#### _Injuries_

For the Texans, their starting left guard has been ruled out. Concerning for a team that struggles enough as is protecting their quarterback.

The Browns are in better shape, though a few pieces of their offensive line remain beat up. Nick Chubb may quite possibly make his return this week after being sidelined the past couple weeks. Should he be activated, his snaps will likely be heavily limited, so his impact on the game will likely be minimal.

#### _History_

Every time the Texans face a team that love to run the ball, it doesn't end well. Baltimore, Minnesota, and Tennessee have consistently shown this Texans defense to be nothing but frauds when it comes to stopping the run.

Similarly, the Browns have their own demons when it comes to pass coverage. Cleveland hasn't really shown itself very capable of shutting down capable passers, as we saw in their two contests against the Bengals. So Deshaun Watson and his ragtag band of receivers should have their moments against this shoddy Cleveland secondary. Then again, their sad outing against Jacksonville last week doesn't inspire much confidence - the Texans as a whole are an organization in serious need of outside intervention.

#### _Weather_

Cool 50-degree weather, but dangerous winds will be ripping across Cleveland on game day.

***

Browns -3

***

**Cleveland covers if**  
The Browns run roughshod all over Houston's demoralized defense.

**Houston covers if**  
Deshaun Watson and his receivers play at a high level in spite of the wind. To this end, Duke Johnson starting at tailback instead of David Johnson should help.

### 49ers @ Saints (-9)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Packers** (34) @ 49ers (17)  
**Saints** (38) @ Buccaneers (3)

#### _Record_

49ers (4-5)  
Saints (6-2)

#### _Injuries_

The 49ers are dangerously thin at wide receiver, though Richie James and Brandon Aiyuk are expected to play. Besides that, the 49ers will not have their primary nickel cornerback as well.

The Saints are fairly healthy.

#### _History_

Last year, these two teams met in Louisiana and it was a surprising shoot-out. I don't expect the same fireworks to pop off given Nick Mullens is starting at quarterback now for San Francisco. Still, the 49ers were able to key in on some of the Saints weaknesses on defense, namely the tendency among their cornerbacks to play outside leverage. San Francisco's weapons made some serious hay with sharp in-breaking routes. On top of that, their running backs also rattled off some lovely yardage, due largely to the struggles the Saints defense have handling outside zone runs.

Still, Brees ran up the score too against a defense many considered to be the best in the league. It was very unexpected. One thing I noted was that the 49ers weren't able to pressure Brees much.

***

49ers +9

***

**San Francisco covers if**  
the 49ers draw on last year's game plan to put some scores up against a Saints team caught slacking off a momentous win last week.

**New Orleans covers if**  
their defensive line overwhelms Nick Mullins and forces him into some terrible decisions.  
\- OR -  
An injury completely exposes San Francisco's lack of depth at receivers.

### Eagles @ Giants (+3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

BYE - Cowboys (9) @ **Eagles** (23)  
**Giants** (23) @ Washington (20)

#### _Record_

Eagles (3-4-1)  
Giants (2-7)

#### _Injuries_

Philadelphia comes into this game about as healthy as can be. Alshon Jeffery, Jalen Reagor, Dallas Goedert, and Miles Sanders are expected to return back into action - their return should elevate this offense, theoretically.

The Giants will be missing a starting cornerback in Isaac Yiadom. A rookie will likely take his place.

#### _History_

These two teams met just two weeks ago. The Giants, despite only keeping the for about 27 minutes, should have won this game. If it wasn't for Carson Wentz's heroics and Evan Engram's laziness, New York would possibly be on top of the division right now.

But Philadelphia was without most of their hyped weapons. This Sunday, the team will see many of them return back to action. What difference that makes remains to be seen though, as those weapons are only effective so long as Carson Wentz plays well.

#### _Weather_

Cool weather with some wind.

***

Giants +3.5

***

**New York covers if**  
the Giants can run the ball with some efficiency and Daniel Jones doesn't turn the ball over more than once.

**Philadelphia covers if**  
the combination of Alshon Jeffery, Miles Sanders, Jalen Reagor, and Dallas Goedert gives this offense some much-needed life.  
\- OR -  
their defensive line can force ugly turnovers from Daniel Jones.

### Broncos @ Raiders (-5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Broncos (27) @ **Falcons** (34)  
**Raiders** (31) @ Chargers (26)

#### _Record_

Broncos (3-5)  
Raiders (5-3)

#### _Injuries_

The Broncos can expect both of their starting cornerbacks to return this Sunday, a very positive development given all the receiving weapons the Raiders are expected to field. Their lackluster offensive line is banged up though. More troubling, so is Jerry Jeudy.

Las Vegas may need to reconstruct the left part of the offensive line come game day. Left tackle Kolton Miller is definitively out and left guard Gabe Jackson may be joining him as well if whatever's ailing him still has him in its grips on Sunday morning.

#### _History_

These two quarterbacks faced off against one another in the last week of the regular season last year. Not sure how much information can be gleaned from that showing, as both teams were essentially dead in the water going into that match.

One thing that's clear to me is that Las Vegas seems to struggle with offenses capable of airing the ball out deep. It's possible the situation there has changed a little over the past couple of weeks, but I honestly doubt the pass coverage unit has improved enough to no longer be considered a liability.

***

Broncos +5

***

**Denver covers if**  
Drew Lock hits on a few deep balls while Philip Lindsay keeps the ground game humming against a soft Raiders defensive front.  
\- OR -  
the offense stages yet another furious comeback in the fourth quarter in a bid to try and win the game.

**Las Vegas covers if**  
the Raiders can still play at an emotionally high level after a succession of wins against significant opponents. The ground game also needs to get going here, as Josh Jacobs will be called upon to close out this game and prevent the Broncos from racking up garbage-time points.

### Chargers @ Dolphins (-2)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Raiders** (31) @ Chargers (26)  
**Dolphins** (34) @ Cardinals (31)

#### _Record_

Chargers (2-6)  
Dolphins (5-3)

#### _Injuries_

Miami loses two starters along their defensive front seven to the COVID-19 bug this week.

The Chargers are fairly healthy, but they will be missing their best player on defense yet again. Without Bosa on the field, the pass rush really suffers.

#### _History_

It's hard to draw comparisons between these two teams. Miami is just starting their third game with Tua as their quarterback. And it's hard to ascribe any definitive identity to their defensive unit, as its been built more as a hybrid defense capable of shifting identities on a weekly basis. Still, the Chargers did face a similarly complex defense not too long ago in Denver, and it looks like Herbert fared pretty well.

#### _Weather_

Hot and moderately humid

***

Dolphins -2

***

**Miami covers if**  
the inside corners and the safeties of the Dolphins perform serviceably against Justin Herbert and the team can channel that winning spirit to close out this game should Herbert try to stage a last-minute comeback.

**Los Angeles covers if**  
the team can finally shirk that losing mentality that's been plaguing them the past several weeks.

### Seahawks @ Rams (-1.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Seahawks (34) @ **Bills** (34)  
BYE - Rams (17) @ **Dolphins** (28)

#### _Record_

Seahawks (6-2)  
Rams (5-3)

#### _Injuries_

The Seahawks are down both of their starting cornerbacks and their center. Not good for a team that runs a cover-three look as their base defense. Judging from last week though, it's likely Carroll will have enough sense to employ a nickel package as his base defense against the Rams.

Rams are pretty healthy coming off the bye.

#### _History_

These two teams met up twice last year, and the results weren't that great for Seattle. Seattle barely edged out the Rams in their first meeting. Los Angeles returned the favor with a blowout in their second match.

One thing worth noting is that it seems Seattle has a hard time harassing Jared Goff last year - the defense notched only four hits on him last year in that second game. The Dolphins, on the other hand, posted nine hits on the schmuck in their rout over Los Angeles two weeks ago.

***

Rams -2

***

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Jared Goff is given enough time in the pocket to check the runners on first and third.

**Seattle covers if**  
Jarred Reed, Carlos Dunlap, and Jamal Adams step up big and harangue Goff to the point where the Rams offense becomes dysfunctional. Certainly possible if Pete Carroll took a few pointers from the Dolphins and the way they dismantled Los Angeles just a few weeks earlier.

### Ravens @ Patriots (+7)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Ravens** (24) @ Colts (10)  
**Patriots** (30) @ Jets (27)

#### _Record_

Ravens (6-2)  
Patriots (3-5)

#### _Injuries_

Ravens will not have Calais Campbell or Jimmy Smith on the field come Sunday night. The loss of Smith hurts a secondary worryingly thin on cornerbacks. Marcus Peters and Marlon Humphries will start as the team's main cornerbacks, but an injury to either one would be devastating.

The Patriots have been a goddamn mess this season when it comes to injuries, and this week is no different. The biggest loss is at cornerback, as Stephon Gilmore won't be around for this game. On a positive note, the offensive line seems pretty healthy. Big news for a team that loves running the ball.

#### _History_

The Patriots have been terrible defensing the run. And the Ravens want to do nothing more than run the ball to kingdom come. The ground game has been the heart and soul of their offense too.

#### _Weather_

A cool night with some wind

***

Patriots +7

***

**New England covers if**  
the Patriots can stop the Ravens from running wild. New England's defense will need to dictate the terms of engagement to the Baltimore offense.  
\- OR -  
New England can dominate time of possession by running forcefully against a Baltimore front without its best run stuffer.

**Baltimore covers if**  
the Ravens are mostly successful rushing the ball against the Patriots defense.

#### Bills @ Cardinals (-1.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Seahawks (34) @ **Bills** (44)  
**Dolphins** (34) @ Cardinals (31)

#### _Record_

Bills (7-2)  
Cardinals (5-3)

#### _Injuries_

Buffalo's secondary will be stripped of three key pieces after a COVID flare-up. Add on top of that the very likely possibility Micah Hyde may be sidelined and Buffalo is coming into the game with a barebones secondary. Best of luck covering Larry Fitzgerald, DeAndre Hopkins, Andy Isabella, and Christian Kirk.

Arizona is in better shape. Their offensive line should see some improvement with the return of J.R. Sweezy. Budda Baker is questionable.

#### _History_

Neither of these two teams know one another well. Buffalo runs a 4-3 defense outfitted with quite a few coverage wrinkles. Arizona literally just faced a similarly complex defense when Miami came to town last week. The Cardinals did well enough, using Kyler's mobility to matriculate the ball on a regular basis.

But Buffalo has a history this season of not faring well against the running game. Kansas City and New England both covered by rushing the ball at will against Buffalo's defense. Thanks to the viable threat of designed quarterback runs, Arizona actually has one of the league's better ground games.

Josh Allen's performance against teams that love to blitz has been a mixed bag.

***

Cardinals -1.5

***

**Arizona covers if**  
the Cardinals bounce back from a rough loss last week and exploit a Buffalo defense missing some pieces/talent at all three levels.

**Buffalo covers if**  
their defensive front flusters Kyler Murray, keeping him from passing or running the ball effectively.
