My picks last week were a mixed bag. Three picks were on the money, as my assumptions were mostly on point, especially when it came to the Carolina-Kansas City game - the Panthers had little trouble covering the spread after dominating time of possession. My Raiders pick was also correct, although to be honest, they were lucky to win that game. Vegas didn't do anything in the fourth quarter to show me they deserved the win.

My assumptions on two of the games were wildly off though. I didn't expect Tua to play at such a high level after his tragic performance last week. Arizona ran up the score against a stingy Miami defense, but Tua was able to match Miami blow-for-blow. The other game where my assumptions fell stupidly flat was the Saints-Buccaneers game, oddly enough the one game I was the most sure about. I honestly saw no way the Buccaneers could lose this game. But lose they did.

I learned to never underestimate good coaches in perceivably tough situations. I also learned the fighting spirit isn't easy to foster in a team that's been hyped up to stratospheric heights the past few weeks. Tampa Bay read way too many of its press clippings lately. It didn't really bother to present anything new to an opponent that literally broke them down earlier in the season. Honestly, I'd say New Orleans was overly prepared against a Buccaneers team running the same tired tricks all year.

Be careful picking hyped favorites.

### Texans @ Browns (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Texans** (27) @ Jaguars (25)  
BYE - **Raiders** (16) @ Browns (6)

#### _Record_

Texans (2-6)  
Browns (5-3)

#### _Injuries_

For the Texans, their starting left guard has been ruled out. Concerning for a team that struggles enough as is protecting their quarterback.

The Browns are in better shape, though a few pieces of their offensive line remain beat up. Nick Chubb may quite possibly make his return this week after being sidelined the past couple weeks. Should he be activated, his snaps will likely be heavily limited, so his impact on the game will likely be minimal.

#### _History_

Every time the Texans face a team that love to run the ball, it doesn't end well. Baltimore, Minnesota, and Tennessee have consistently shown this Texans defense to be nothing but frauds when it comes to stopping the run.

Similarly, the Browns have their own demons when it comes to pass coverage. Cleveland hasn't really shown itself very capable of shutting down capable passers, as we saw in their two contests against the Bengals. So Deshaun Watson and his ragtag band of receivers should have their moments against this shoddy Cleveland secondary. Then again, their sad outing against Jacksonville last week doesn't inspire much confidence - the Texans as a whole are an organization in serious need of outside intervention.

#### _Weather_

Cool 50-degree weather, but dangerous winds will be ripping across Cleveland on game day.

Browns -3

**Cleveland covers if**  
The Browns run roughshod all over Houston's demoralized defense.

**Houston covers if**  
Deshaun Watson and his receivers play at a high level in spite of the wind. To this end, Duke Johnson starting at tailback instead of David Johnson should help.
