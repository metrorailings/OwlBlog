##### _Cardinals_ @ Buccaneers (-4.5)

A little wary of this pick, as Tampa Bay tends to play better against non-division opponents. And really, the Buccaneers should have covered last week against Seattle, which means this spread should be a touch higher.

Still...Arizona has been remarkably competent over the past couple weeks. Kliff Kingsbury's willingness to tweak his air raid philosophy over the past few weeks and incorporate more rushing plays into the offensive playbook has paid off in spades. Kyler Murray and this Cardinals team has found their rhythm and played well, even putting up an admirable performance against the league's best defense last week. I expect the good times to keep on going, especially if Patrick Peterson and Buddha Baker are out there in the secondary picking off some of Jameis Winston's errant throws.

##### Falcons @ _Saints_ (-13)

I'm not the biggest fan of taking the Saints as double-digit favorites, as the team has a habit of taking games off every now and then. But with this game is against a hated division rival, I do expect New Orleans to play hard here, especially against a Falcons defense made out of cardboard cut-outs.
