All right, so the Supercontest is a lost cause. I'm pretty sure I'm treading water at exactly 50%. Statistically, I'm no better than a coin. A fucking coin.

But at the very least, each season offers up lessons for me to internalize. I like to believe I improve as a bettor every year. To be honest though, my best year as a sports gambler has been the first year I've actually started wagering serious money. Sooner or later, I will eventually match my sensational performance from that year.

Until then...week 11.

##### _Vikings (+2.5)_ @ Bears

The few outlets and NFL writers I respect have all sided with Minnesota here. And I will too. 

Mitchell Trubisky is overrated. Analytical outfits continue to trash him week after week, despite his glowing passer rating. Careful observers have noted Trubisky's shortcomings, particularly against the blitz. And Mike Zimmer, as one of the best defensive minds in the game, has a history of exposing bad quarterbacks. 

So at the very least, expect the Bears offense to finally stall this week, despite Matt Nagy's best attempts to scheme around a quarterback with limited ability.

##### Buccaneers @ _Giants (-2.5)_

The Buccaneers are losers. To rack up over 500-ish yards on offense only to post 3 measly points...it's pathetic. The Buccaneers are a damn mess on offense. Neither Jameis nor Fitzpatrick are serving the team well.

The Giants on the other hand have stepped up their game last week. Sure, Eli Manning was not as impressive as his statistics from last week may imply...but Eli still managed to finish drives, one of which won the game. 

Tampa Bay should be able to score a few times in the game, but I expect the Giants to rack up even more points. Reviewing the game tape from last week, it seems Tampa Bay is happily content playing a soft zone defense. And these defenses tend to be exposed by offenses fielding a solid bunch of receivers. So the Giants have no excuse to lose this game in their quest to win out the rest of the season.

##### Eagles @ _Saints (-8.5)_

Seems odd to see the reigning Super Bowl champions be such heavy underdogs. But the Elo model thinks it's well-deserved.

Frankly, I'm shocked that the sportsbooks haven't set the line even higher, considering the Saints are coming off three consecutive covers against solid competition. I'd honestly expect the books to set the line a little higher than usual in order to pull underdog money against such an elite team. Either the books are fine pricing the Saints appropriately or the spread is kept lower than usual to entice bets on a public darling in the Saints. If the latter is the case, that means the books are taking a chance on the Eagles here in this match. And that's a risky proposition in my book.

The Eagles are far from being that team that took the league by storm last year. Michael Lombardi gave me some phenomenal insights in his observations about the team. Last season, the team was converting third downs at an unbelievable clip.  This season, statistical regression finally reared its ugly head - Philadelphia is struggling to overcome third-down from six yards and out. Worse yet, the Eagles cannot run the ball, leading to their offense being one-dimensional. A pass-only offense is not necessarily a terrible thing so long as the quarterback has several weapons reliably catching his passes, but Philly's even lacking horses there. Nelson Agholor has regressed to mediocre form while Alshon Jeffery has been hampered by injury for much of the season. 

To be fair, their acquisition of Golden Tate should even things out a bit, but I honestly wonder whether that would be enough to keep pace with the league's hottest team on their home soil.

##### Panthers @ Lions

Such a beautiful spot for the Lions here. Coming off three embarrassing losses, Detroit is primed to play better now that they've returned back home and their season is on the line. And last week's game against Chicago shows me that the team can defend against the run when it's a central focus of their defensive game plan. Snacks Harrison manning the nose position has brought up their rush defense a notch.

If the Panthers cannot run the ball with reckless abandon here, Carolina may actually struggle to move the chains, let alone put up points. It wouldn't be a terrible bet to put some money on the Lions here, but _Marvin Jones_ will be ruled out of the game on injury. The offense was limped without Golden Tate, and now you take their best receiver off the field as well? Too risky.

##### Cowboys @ Falcons

The Falcons were depressing last week. Matt Ryan loses a step as a passer whenever he plays outside a dome. On top of that, that defense was carved up by Baker Mayfield and his skill players.

Now, the Falcons are currently fielding the league's worst run defense, on a yards-per-carry basis. But in fairness, that dishonor can be attributed to a 92-yard run Nick Chubb ripped off for a touchdown. Take away that play and the Falcons would instead be ranked as the tenth worst team against the run. Still, the point is that Atlanta is susceptible against the rush, which should be sweet music to a Cowboys team that rediscovered their ground game last week against the Eagles. If Ezekiel Elliott was able to chew off 150 yards on 20 carries at Philadelphia in primetime, the man should be ready to feast again on a Falcons defense that's equally inept at defending the run.

Then again, the Falcons do have one thing going for them - the fact that the team plays a few orders of magnitude better within the confines of their dome. In particular, take Matt Ryan - his passes see much more air in Atlanta than anywhere else. Likewise, I'd think that defense plays with more energy in front of their home crowd. So it's a bit difficult to take a side here, especially when Dak Prescott insists on playing stupid.
