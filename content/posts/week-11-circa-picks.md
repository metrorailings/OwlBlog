+++
Bit of an uninspiring week, to say the least. Even though one of the cardinal rules of sports gambling is to not bet heavy road favorites, I still did that anyway with Tampa Bay last week. Worse yet, I knew Tampa's offense would struggle a bit without Antonio Brown or Rob Gronkowski. Yet I still backed them, thinking Washington's defense would just roll over and die before the first quarter would even end.

My other loss was Las Vegas. Bit of a shocker in all honesty. It was clear the Raiders never took the game as seriously as the Chiefs. Regardless, I promised myself that I'd continue betting against the Chiefs so long as their offense and defense kept proving themselves horribly inept. While the jury is still out about the Kansas offense, it's clear the defense has made significant strides in the past month - it's no longer the bottom-feeding unit setting new abysmal records on a weekly basis. I need to be more careful betting the Chiefs from this point onward.

So here we are - week 11. More than halfway through the season and I seem to have settled into a groove of 3-win weeks peppered with 4-win weeks here and there. Ambitions are much higher riding into the second half of the season - it's now time to start aiming for perfect weeks, as hard as that may be to achieve on a regular basis. So let's get to it.

### Lions @ Browns (-11)

#### _Latest Results_

_Lions_ @ Steelers (Tie)  
Browns @ **_Patriots_**

#### _Key Injuries_

Detroit is likely to lose Trey Flowers next week, though his presence this year has been muted a bit by injury anyway. It's arguable as to whether any one injury matters to this defense given how badly they've been performing.

A few of the cornerbacks are injured for the Browns and expected to be out as well. Otherwise, all other injuries are in a manageable state.

UPDATE: Detroit, through some injury fortune, will now be starting Tim Boyle in place of Jared Goff.

#### _History_

No recent history between these two. The Lions have been playing atrocious  on both sides of the ball. Jared Goff at quarterback has been a failed experiment. Dan Campbell seizing play-calling duties away from Anthony Lynn last night didn't do much to change the tenor of the passing offense. Sure, Detroit can run the ball...but without any semblance of an air game, the offense cannot sustain consistent production.

Cleveland has its own warts, but the franchise isn't in as much shit shape as Detroit's. If Cleveland is a car scuffed up with dents and running on a busted cylinder, Detroit is a car with its engine dropped out riding down the street.

UPDATE: Now that Tim Boyle is playing, I'll be staying away from this game. It's uncertain whether this offense assumes a new identity under Boyle. At least Goff was predictable with his idiotically short passing. If Boyle exhibits the recklessness of somebody like Taylor Heinecke in his first start, it could rejuvenate some life back into this Lion offense.

Browns -11

**Cleveland covers if**  
after being embarrassed by the Patriots, the organization kicks it up a notch and wins in authoritative fashion against an underwhelming Detroit outfit  
\- AND -  
their ground game finds renewed life against Detroit's slow defensive front.

**Detroit covers if**  
the Browns are caught slacking off from what should be an easy win for them  
\- OR -  
Tim Boyle redefines this offense into something much more aggressive than what it was under Goff.

### Packers @ Vikings (+1.5)

#### _Latest Results_

Seahawks @ **_Packers_**  
**_Vikings_** @ Chargers

#### _Key Injuries_

Aaron Jones won't be returning to the field for the next few weeks, thanks to an MCL sprain. Rookie AJ Dillon will take the mantle as the team's primary rusher. On top of that, the newly acquired Whitney Mercilus is expected to be out for the season. Quite disappointing considering he recorded his first sack as a Green Bay Packer last week and may have stood to contribute even more through the rest of the season. Rashan Gary is worth watching this week, as he was hit with an injury midway through last week's game.

Harrison Smith and Anthony Barr are expected to return this week after being placed on the COVID list last week.

UPDATE: Rashan Gary is listed as questionable, although he's logged three consecutive limited practices this week. Chances are he'll play, though to what effect remains to be seen. 

#### _History_

Green Bay and Minnesota split games last year. In their latest game, Minnesota pulled out a six-point win, thanks largely to the Packers not being all that focused coming into the game. It's not hard to see why the Packers weren't that ready either - the Vikings were brutalized the week before by an Atlanta team that just fired its head coach. On top of that, Green Bay was probably looking ahead to exacting bitter revenge against the 49ers that coming Thursday.

This year, Kirk Cousins and the offense have stalled way too much, especially against teams with solid defensive fronts. If the team is forced to rely on Kirk Cousins to maintain production on offense, it's not pretty. Luckily for the Vikings, Green Bay hasn't been the best at defending against the rush though. To be fair though, the defense seems to have changed face the past three weeks, letting up only about 140 yards against 36 carries by starting halfbacks.

#### _Weather_

Dome affair

Packers -2.5

**Green Bay covers if**  
their defense continues exceeding its early season form and shuts down Dalvin Cook, forcing an easily spooked Kirk Cousins to carry this offense against Green Bay's venerable pass rush.

**Minnesota covers if**  
Dalvin Cook is able to keep the offense churning, rushing for more than 4.5 yards per carry on average.

### Colts @ Bills (-7)

***

#### _Latest Results_

_Jaguars_ @ **Colts**  
**_Bills_** @ Jets

#### _Key Injuries_

Both teams have injury concerns among their coverage personnel, though nothing seriously concerning.

#### _History_

Both teams met last year in the postseason, the only major difference between now and then being that the Colts were starting Philip "dadgummit" Rivers at quarterback. One _could_ make the argument that Carson Wentz is an upgrade in that department. It's ill-advised, but one _could_ certainly try and make that argument. I'd say it's been (more or less) a lateral move going from Rivers to Wentz.

Anyway, the Colts lost by only three points, though the Bills had wrist control for much of the game. Still, the fact that Indianapolis was able to fight within a field goal and kept things competitive at the end is testament enough that these two teams are closer matched than raw statistics otherwise suggest.

To be fair, we do have several more differentials at play here, notably that the Colts have effectively replaced TY Hilton's role on offense with Michael Pittman and the Bills now have a top-tier pass rusher in Greg Rousseau. Perhaps most important is that their game last year was a postseason affair, whereas the game this year is a routine one dully taking place in the early afternoon.

Watching the game, I noticed Indianapolis honestly playing very well against a Bills team. It's possible Buffalo may not have been fully committed to the game given they were seven-point favorites, but the Colts really hammered them through a combination of Jonathan Taylor and Michael Pittman, with a little TY Hilton mixed in. On top of that, the Indianapolis defense really bothered Josh Allen in this game, forcing him out of the pocket on a number of occasions and keeping him from improvising successfully, at least for the first half. DeForest Buckner and Darius Leonard deserve special kudos for their individual efforts in this regard.

#### _Weather_

Chilly with some rain expected

Colts +7

**Indianapolis covers if**  
Carson Wentz doesn't turn the ball over more than once. The team has enough weaponry and the type of defense to frustrate Buffalo's offense, it's just a matter of whether Wentz can stop playing such reckless hero ball against a Buffalo defense many take to be one of the best in the league  
\- OR -  
Buffalo is caught playing lazy, partly because their opponent is such a decisive underdog and partly because these Bills are slated to play in a big primetime spot a few days later on Thanksgiving.

**Buffalo covers if**  
they take the Colts seriously enough despite the circumstances giving them too many excuses to slack off  
\- AND -  
the Bills can force Carson Wentz to commit multiple turnovers.

### Saints @ Eagles (-1.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

_Saints_ @ **Titans**  
**_Eagles_** @ Broncos

#### _Key Injuries_

It scares me when both tackles for the Saints as well as their star tailback have been unable to practice Thursday. I know practice is overrated, but to not even log a limited practice session on a critical day leading up to the game is concerning. Perhaps Friday will bring some positive news for New Orleans.

Eagles might be down their first-string tight end in Dallas Goedert. Not sure if it matters much, to be honest, given the run-oriented nature of their offense.

UPDATE: Nope, the Saints will be without the book-ends to their offensive line as well as Alvin Kamara. Not good. Eagles might also lose Derek Barnett to a neck injury that suddenly popped up Friday.

#### _History_

Both these teams mets last year in what was an upset for the Eagles. New Orleans was completely thrown off course by Jalen Hurts and his speed - it's likely Sean Payton and company weren't as worried about Hurts rushing the ball, even though it was his biggest strength in college.

Things are a bit different now that Philadelphia completely overhauled its coaching staff, with the biggest changes exhibited on defense - Jonathan Gannon's defense is nowhere near as competent nor as dynamic as Jim Schwartz's unit. Where Schwartz had his unit playing at a level greater than the sum of its parts, Gannon's squad has been routinely abused by quarterbacks who understand the proper way to attack their simple coverage schemes. To be frank, I don't believe Trevor Siemian capable of dissecting this defense on his own - Payton will need to hold his hand here should New Orleans hope to rack up significant yardage. 

#### _Weather_

Decent weather considering it's November, though the field is expected to be wet from some overnight rain

***

Undecided

***

**New Orleans covers if**  
Sean Payton and Dennis Allen go out of their way to prevent Philadelphia from developing any rhythm rushing the ball. A part of me is convinced Hurts' confidence level really impacts this offense - so long as Miles Sanders is out, Philadelphia's offense lives and dies by whatever mood Hurts is in  
\- AND -  
the Saints don't overlook this game in preparation for their upcoming match against Buffalo on Thanksgiving. Trevor Siemian has proven himself capable of moving the ball, so long as the focus is there  
\- AND -  
the Saints can keep Siemien protected, despite losing both their starting tackles.

**Philadelphia covers if  
**New Orleans isn't fully invested in the game given the primetime game coming up on Thanksgiving on their home turf  
\- OR -  
the Saints fail to adjust for the exotic nature of the Eagles college-style offense, despite featuring one of the league's best defenses.

### Ravens @ Bears (+4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Ravens @ **_Dolphins_** (TNF)  
BYE - Bears

#### _Key Injuries_

Lamar Jackson's dealing with some strange illness this week. He hasn't practiced at all, but the team doesn't seem too concerned. Is this COVID related?  To compound things, Hollywood Brown hasn't been practicing either.

Despite the bye, Chicago hasn't improved much in terms of injuries. The defensive front seven is banged up across the board. On top of that, Allen Robinson is dealing with issues of his own.

UPDATE: Khalil Mack is out for the season and Akiem Hicks won't be playing this week. It'll be up to Robert Quinn and Roquan Smith to carry the load in their absence.

#### _History_

Chicago was dealt its worst game this season by Tampa Bay and its litany of blitzes. The fact of the matter is that its pass protection is still not up to snuff. Even though Chicago's offensive line fares better at home than on the road, it's still inept. But the ace in the hole for Chicago here is their ground game, headlined by Justin Fields and Khalil Herbert. Baltimore's run defense has been rough as of lately. If Nagy and his coaches can leverage a litany of rushing concepts to keep the chains moving, Baltimore's in for a world of hurt. Then again, Nagy's team has historically been depressing coming out of their bye week.

#### _Weather_

Cold and windy

Ravens -4.5

**Baltimore covers if**  
Lamar Jackson plays through whatever's ailing him  
\- AND -  
Jackson and the tailbacks can help the offense dominate time of possession against a Bears defense not fully healthy up front.

**Chicago covers if**  
Lamar Jackson is out  
\- OR -  
Khalil Herbert and Justin Fields can churn yardage consistently through the ground.

### Steelers @ Chargers (-6.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

_Lions_ @ Steelers (Tie)  
**_Vikings_** @ Chargers

#### _Key Injuries_

Pittsburgh will be without the heart and soul of their defense in T.J. Watt. Isiahh Loudermilk has been declared out as well, so front-line defensive resources are pretty strained going into Sunday night. On top of that, Joe Haden and Minkah Fitzpatrick have been ruled out as well, putting that secondary in real danger of coverage lapses and mental errors. Considering this unit will be tasked with limiting Justin Herbert, now's not the best time to be so banged up across the board.

Chargers will finally get back some help in the secondary, although they **may** end up losing some key players along the front now to COVID. Their best pass rushers, Joey Bosa and Jerry Tillery, may be ruled out if any of their COVID tests over the weekend come up positive. Also, Linval Joseph is doubtful to play with ailments of his own, dealing a significant blow to a rushing defense that was pretty woeful already.

#### _History_

Neither of these two teams have faced each other recently. Neither has Pittsburgh faced off recently against a Saints-style offense, as far as I'm aware. So not much insight can be gleaned here from historical contests.

The one thing for sure though is that Pittsburgh is going to be leaning heavily on Najee Harris to keep the ball motoring through this Charger defense. Los Angeles has yet to demonstrate they're capable of stonewalling opposing rushers. In fact, it's quite possible the Chargers may be the worst team in the league at defensing the run. And without Linval Joseph and possibly other linemen, that run defense should be expected to fall further down the abyss.

#### _Weather_

**Pittsburgh covers if**  
Najee Harris can chew off more than four yards per rush, keeping most drives alive and setting up the Steelers with quite a few scoring opportunities  
\- AND -  
their defense doesn't lose too much of its mojo being without so many key players  
\- AND -  
Mike Williams is kept under lock and key for much of the game

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Mike Williams gets back into form and converts on at least three passes thrown more than 20 yards past the line of scrimmage  
\- AND -  
Pittsburgh's offense sputters on more than half their drives.

### Giants @ Buccaneers (+11)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Giants - BYE  
Buccaneers @ **_Washington_**

#### _Key Injuries_

The bye week has served the Giants well. All their key players on offense are primed to return, except Sterling Shepard, as his quads are still preventing him from practicing. Furthermore, Andrew Thomas is finally returning to action as well, which should help the offensive line regain some of its footing. On defense, New York is still mostly healthy save for Logan Ryan, who's currently trapped in COVID protocol.

For Tampa Bay, Antonio Brown is likely out yet again. Unfortunately for my Giants, Rob Gronkowski has been practicing in full, so Brady will have his favorite weapon back in primetime. Gronk combined with Mike Evans can make things messy for the Giants defense.

#### _History_

These two were pitted against one another last year on Monday. It's widely believed Tampa Bay wasn't fully committed to the game, looking ahead instead to their upcoming game with the Saints. Even still, the fact that the Giants were able to nearly pull out the win against the eventual Super Bowl champions is pretty impressive. Then again...the Buccaneers didn't really hit their stride until after the bye, so it's uncertain how much weight the game holds in light of this upcoming match.

#### _Weather_

Temperate, if not a little humid and windy

***

Giants +11

***

**New York covers if**  
the return of most of their receiving weapons can keep the offense decently productive against an overly aggressive Tampa Bay defense  
\- AND -  
Patrick Graham and the rest of the defensive coaches mount a game plan prioritizing Mike Evans and Rob Gronkowski in coverage.

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
Leonard Fournette and Mike Evans collaborating with a healthy Rob Gronkowski finally takes the Buc offense back to something resembling early-season form.

### 49ers @ Jaguars (+6.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Rams @ **_49ers_** (MNF)  
_Jaguars_ @ **Colts**

#### _Key Injuries_

San Francisco will have both of their headline runners in Elijah Mitchell and JaMycal Hasty sidelined, so the ground game is expected to lose much of its potency.

Jacksonville may follow suit too with their own star tailback. But in a positive step, James Robinson managed to log a practice this Friday. JRob still managed to play after being banged up all of last week, so chances are fair he'll be able to join his brothers in action again this week.

#### _History_

No relevant history to explore here given that this is an inter-conference game. It's worth noting that Jacksonville's run defense has been pretty solid this season, going by yards per carry as well as Football Outsiders own proprietary metrics. A quick examination of all their games over the season tells me this defense only surrenders major yardage to elite rushers, so expect San Francisco to struggle without the services of their main running backs. Then again...Deebo Samuel manages to shine whenever he moonlights in the backfield...

#### _Weather_

A lovely day to play some football, although winds are expected to reach up to ten miles per hour

Jaguars +6.5

**Jacksonville covers if**  
San Francisco doesn't take this game as seriously as it should  
\- AND -  
Jeff Wilson and Deebo Samuel are unable to compensate for the rushing production the 49ers would normally get from Mitchell and Hasty.

**San Francisco covers if**  
Jimmy Garoppalo can mount an air game against Jacksonville  
\- AND -  
their skill players aren't as sloppy as they were two weeks ago against the Cardinals. Nothing kills morale faster than constantly losing the ball at the end of promising drives  
\- AND -  
the players remain fully committed to their craft after winning a statement game against the Rams the past Monday. It'll be all the more difficult to maintain focus knowing Jacksonville's a bottom-feeder.
