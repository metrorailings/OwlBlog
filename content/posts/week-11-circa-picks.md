Bit of an uninspiring week, to say the least. Even though one of the cardinal rules of sports gambling is to not bet heavy road favorites, I still did that anyway with Tampa Bay last week. Worse yet, I knew Tampa's offense would struggle a bit without Antonio Brown or Rob Gronkowski. Yet I still backed them, thinking Washington's defense would just roll over and die before the first quarter would even end.

My other loss was Las Vegas. Bit of a shocker in all honesty. It was clear the Raiders never took the game as seriously as the Chiefs. Regardless, I promised myself that I'd continue betting against the Chiefs so long as their offense and defense kept proving themselves horribly inept. While the jury is still out about the Kansas offense, it's clear the defense has made significant strides in the past month - it's no longer the bottom-feeding unit setting new abysmal records on a weekly basis. I need to be more careful betting the Chiefs from this point onward.

So here we are - week 11. More than halfway through the season and I seem to have settled into a groove of 3-win weeks peppered with 4-win weeks here and there. Ambitions are much higher riding into the second half of the season - it's now time to start aiming for perfect weeks, as difficult as that may be to achieve on a regular basis. So let's get to it.
