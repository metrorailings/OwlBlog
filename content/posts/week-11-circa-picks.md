+++
Bit of an uninspiring week, to say the least. Even though one of the cardinal rules of sports gambling is to not bet heavy road favorites, I still did that anyway with Tampa Bay last week. Worse yet, I knew Tampa's offense would struggle a bit without Antonio Brown or Rob Gronkowski. Yet I still backed them, thinking Washington's defense would just roll over and die before the first quarter would even end.

My other loss was Las Vegas. Bit of a shocker in all honesty. It was clear the Raiders never took the game as seriously as the Chiefs. Regardless, I promised myself that I'd continue betting against the Chiefs so long as their offense and defense kept proving themselves horribly inept. While the jury is still out about the Kansas offense, it's clear the defense has made significant strides in the past month - it's no longer the bottom-feeding unit setting new abysmal records on a weekly basis. I need to be more careful betting the Chiefs from this point onward.

So here we are - week 11. More than halfway through the season and I seem to have settled into a groove of 3-win weeks peppered with 4-win weeks here and there. Ambitions are much higher riding into the second half of the season - it's now time to start aiming for perfect weeks, as hard as that may be to achieve on a regular basis. So let's get to it.

### Lions @ Browns (-11)

_Lions_ @ Steelers (Tie)  
Browns @ **_Patriots_**

#### _Key Injuries_

Detroit is likely to lose Trey Flowers next week, though his presence this year has been muted a bit by injury anyway. It's arguable as to whether any one injury matters to this defense given how badly they've been performing.

A few of the cornerbacks are injured for the Browns and expected to be out as well. Otherwise, all other injuries are in a manageable state.

#### _History_

No recent history between these two. The Lions have been playing atrocious  on both sides of the ball. Jared Goff at quarterback has been a failed experiment. Dan Campbell seizing play-calling duties away from Anthony Lynn last night didn't do much to change the tenor of the passing offense. Sure, Detroit can run the ball...but without any semblance of an air game, the offense cannot sustain consistent production.

Cleveland has its own warts, but the franchise isn't in as much shit shape as Detroit's. If Cleveland is a car scuffed up with dents and running on a busted cylinder, Detroit is a car with its engine dropped out riding down the street.

Browns -11

**Cleveland covers if**  
after being embarrassed by the Patriots, the organization kicks it up a notch and wins in authoritative fashion against an underwhelming Detroit outfit  
\- AND -  
their ground game finds renewed life against Detroit's slow defensive front.

**Detroit covers if**  
the Browns are caught slacking off from what should be an easy win for them. Even though the Lions have no

### Packers @ Vikings (+1.5)

#### _Latest Results_

Seahawks @ **_Packers_**  
**_Vikings_** @ Chargers

#### _Key Injuries_

Aaron Jones won't be returning to the field for the next few weeks, thanks to an MCL sprain. Rookie AJ Dillon will take the mantle as the team's primary rusher. On top of that, the newly acquired Whitney Mercilus is expected to be out for the season. Quite disappointing considering he recorded his first sack as a Green Bay Packer last week and may have stood to contribute even more through the rest of the season. Rashan Gary is worth watching this week, as he was hit with an injury midway through last week's game.

Harrison Smith is expected to return this week after being placed on the COVID list last week.

#### _History_

Green Bay and Minnesota split games last year. In their latest game, Minnesota pulled out a six-point win, thanks largely to the Packers not being all that focused coming into the game. It's not hard to see why the Packers weren't that ready either - the Vikings were brutalized the week before by an Atlanta team that just fired its head coach. On top of that, Green Bay was probably looking ahead to exacting bitter revenge against the 49ers that coming Thursday.

This year, Kirk Cousins and the offense have stalled way too much, especially against teams with solid defensive fronts. If the team is forced to rely on Kirk Cousins to maintain production on offense, it's not pretty. Luckily for the Vikings, Green Bay hasn't been the best at defending against the rush though. To be fair though, the defense seems to have changed face the past three weeks, letting up only about 140 yards against 36 carries by starting halfbacks.

Packers -2.5

**Green Bay covers if**  
their defense continues exceeding its early season expectations and shuts down Dalvin Cook, forcing an easily spooked Kirk Cousins to carry this offense against Green Bay's venerable pass rush.

**Minnesota covers if**  
Dalvin Cook is able to keep the offense churning, rushing for more than 4.5 yards per carry on average.

### Colts @ Bills (-7)

#### _Latest Results_

_Jaguars_ @ **Colts**  
**_Bills_** @ Jets

#### _Key Injuries_

Both teams have injury concerns among their coverage personnel, though nothing seriously concerning.

#### _History_

Both teams met last year in the postseason, the only major difference between now and then being that the Colts were starting Philip "dadgummit" Rivers at quarterback. One _could_ make the argument that Carson Wentz is an upgrade in that department. It's ill-advised, but one _could_ certainly try and make that argument. I'd say it's been (more or less) a lateral move going from Rivers to Wentz.

Anyway, the Colts lost by only three points, though the Bills had wrist control for much of the game. Still, the fact that Indianapolis was able to fight within a field goal and kept things competitive at the end is testament enough that these two teams are closer matched than raw statistics otherwise suggest.

To be fair, we do have several more differentials at play here, notably that the Colts have effectively replaced TY Hilton's role on offense with Michael Pittman and the Bills now have a top-tier pass rusher in Greg Rousseau. Perhaps most important is that their game last year was a postseason affair, whereas the game this year is a routine one dully taking place in the early afternoon.

Watching the game, I noticed Indianapolis honestly playing very well against a Bills team. It's possible Buffalo may not have been fully committed to the game given they were seven-point favorites, but the Colts really hammered them through a combination of Jonathan Taylor and Michael Pittman, with a little TY Hilton mixed in. On top of that, the Indianapolis defense really bothered Josh Allen in this game, forcing him out of the pocket on a number of occasions and keeping him from improvising successfully, at least for the first half. DeForest Buckner and Darius Leonard deserve special kudos for their individual efforts in this regard.

Colts +7

**Indianapolis covers if**  
Carson Wentz doesn't turn the ball over more than once. The team has enough weaponry and the type of defense to frustrate Buffalo's offense, it's just a matter of whether Wentz can stop playing such reckless hero ball against a Buffalo defense many take to be one of the best in the league  
\- OR -  
Buffalo is caught playing lazy, partly because their opponent is such a decisive underdog and partly because these Bills are slated to play in a big primetime spot a few days later on Thanksgiving.

**Buffalo covers if**  
they take the Colts seriously enough despite the circumstances giving them too many excuses to slack off  
\- AND -  
the Bills can force Carson Wentz to commit multiple turnovers.

### Saints @ Eagles (-1.5)

#### _Latest Results_

_Saints_ @ **Titans**  
**_Eagles_** @ Broncos

#### _Key Injuries_

It scares me when both tackles for the Saints as well as their star tailback have been unable to practice Thursday. I know practice is overrated, but to not even log a limited practice session on a critical day leading up to the game is concerning. Perhaps Friday will bring some positive news for New Orleans.

Eagles might be down their first-string tight end in Dallas Goedert. Not sure if it matters much, to be honest, given the structure of their offense.

#### _History_

Both these teams mets last year in what was an upset for the Eagles. New Orleans was completely thrown off course by Jalen Hurts and his speed - it's likely Sean Payton and company weren't as worried about Hurts rushing the ball, even though it was his biggest strength in college.

Things are a bit different now that Philadelphia completely overhauled its coaching staff, with the biggest changes exhibited on defense - Jonathan Gannon's defense is nowhere near as competent nor dynamic as Jim Schwartz's unit. Where Schwartz had his unit playing at a level greater than the sum of its parts, Gannon's squad has been routinely abused by quarterbacks who understand the proper way to attack the few coverage schemes they've been trained to employ. To be frank, I don't believe Trevor Siemian capable of dissecting this defense on his own - Payton will need to hold his hand here should New Orleans hope to rack up significant yardage. 

#### _Weather_

Decent weather considering it's November, though the field is expected to be wet from some overnight rain

***

Saints +1.5

***

**New Orleans covers if**  
Sean Payton and Dennis Allen go out of their way to prevent Philadelphia from developing any rhythm through their rush-oriented offense. A part of me is convinced Hurts' confidence level really impacts this offense - so long as Miles Sanders is out, Philadelphia's offense it lives and dies by whatever vibes Hurts lets off  
\- AND -  
the Saints don't overlook this game in preparation of their upcoming match against Buffalo on Thanksgiving.

**Philadelphia covers if  
**New Orleans is caught slacking  
\- OR -  
the Saints fail to adjust for the exotic nature of the Eagles college-style offense, despite featuring one of the league's best defenses.

### Ravens @ Bears (+4.5)

Ravens @ **_Dolphins_** (TNF)  
BYE - Bears

#### _Key Injuries_

Lamar Jackson's dealing with some strange illness this week. He hasn't practiced at all, but the team doesn't seem too concerned. Is this COVID related?  To compound things, Hollywood Brown hasn't been practicing either.

Despite the bye, Chicago hasn't improved much in terms of injuries. The defensive front seven is banged up across the board. On top of that, Allen Robinson is dealing with issues of his own.

#### _History_

Chicago was dealt its worst game this season by Tampa Bay and its litany of blitzes. The fact of the matter is that its pass protection is still not up to snuff. Even though Chicago's offensive line fares better at home than on the road, it's still inept. Now Justin Fields and Khalil Herbert can rush the ball, and Baltimore's performance defensing against running plays has been middling as of lately. If Fields and Herbert can matriculate the ball through the ground game, it can be troubling for Baltimore.
