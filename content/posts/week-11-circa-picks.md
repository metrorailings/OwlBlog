Bit of an uninspiring week, to say the least. Even though one of the cardinal rules of sports gambling is to not bet heavy road favorites, I still did that anyway with Tampa Bay last week. Worse yet, I knew Tampa's offense would struggle a bit without Antonio Brown or Rob Gronkowski. Yet I still backed them, thinking Washington's defense would just roll over and die before the first quarter would even end.

My other loss was Las Vegas. Bit of a shocker in all honesty. It was clear the Raiders never took the game as seriously as the Chiefs. Regardless, I promised myself that I'd continue betting against the Chiefs so long as their offense and defense kept proving themselves horribly inept. While the jury is still out about the Kansas offense, it's clear the defense has made significant strides in the past month - it's no longer the bottom-feeding unit setting new abysmal records on a weekly basis. I need to be more careful betting the Chiefs from this point onward.

So here we are - week 11. More than halfway through the season and I seem to have settled into a groove of 3-win weeks peppered with 4-win weeks here and there. Ambitions are much higher riding into the second half of the season - it's now time to start aiming for perfect weeks, as difficult as that may be to achieve on a regular basis. So let's get to it.

Lions @ Steelers (Tie)  
Browns @ **Patriots**

#### _Key Injuries_

Detroit is likely to lose Trey Flowers next week, though his presence this year has been muted a bit by injury anyway. It's arguable as to whether any one injury matters to this defense given how badly they've been performing.

A few of the cornerbacks are injured for the Browns and expected to be out as well. Otherwise, all other injuries are in a manageable state.

#### _History_

No recent history between these two. The Lions have been playing atrocious  on both sides of the ball. Jared Goff at quarterback has been a failed experiment. Dan Campbell seizing play-calling duties away from Anthony Lynn last night didn't do much to change the tenor of the passing offense. Sure, Detroit can run the ball...but without any semblance of an air game, the offense cannot sustain consistent production.

Cleveland has its own warts, but the franchise isn't in as much shit shape as Detroit's. If Cleveland is a car scuffed up with dents and running on a busted cylinder, Detroit is a car with its engine dropped out riding down the street.

#### _Key Injuries_

Aaron Jones won't be returning to the field for the next few weeks, thanks to an MCL sprain. Rookie AJ Dillon will take the mantle as the team's primary rusher. On top of that, the newly acquired Whitney Mercilus is expected to be out for the season. Quite disappointing considering he recorded his first sack as a Green Bay Packer last week and may have stood to contribute even more the rest of the way through.
