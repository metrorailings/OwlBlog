## Packers @ Vikings

Odd start so far to the game. Rodgers playing poorly, not respecting warnings from the officials and holding the ball way too long. The great question here has always been whether Rodgers can trust anybody else besides Davante Adams with the ball.

Green Bay coverage lapse led to a massive Justin Jefferson reception.

Yet more poor coverage from the Packers. Kirk Cousins has been perfect so far in the first quarter.

Has Rodgers been slinging the ball too high when he throws out routes towards the sidelines?

One thing that's clear is that Minnesota not blitzing has frustrated Rodgers. He can't find an open receiver against their coverage shells. Are they masking coverage?

Kenny Clark is beasting as a pass rushing defensive tackle.

Rodgers playing like a little bitch. Cover-two is frustrating the hell out of him, though I suspect they also have Davante Adams wrapped up in bracket coverage. Randall Cobb not doing anything either...I wonder if he's even playing?

Perhaps Rodgers not practicing is what's hurting him here. No real confidence in any of his players.

Justin Jefferson now running routes out of the backfield...interesting. It's paid off tremendously on one drive.

Packers cannot hold up in man coverage against elite receivers.

## 49ers @ Jaguars

Deebo Samuel has been sensational so far as a tailback. Forget Jeff Wilson.

Texans winning, Jets looking pretty good...yet the one bad team I decide to back is Jacksonville. I need to read these bad teams better.

Jaguars are actually hitting home on some blitzes. On top of that, their run defense has been mostly effective. What's killed them )at least on the first drive) has been their secondary.

Once again, their secondary makes critical mistakes, commit sloppy penalties, and fail to stop routes that they should win by merit of coverage shell.

Trevor Laurence might trust his feet a bit too much. That and he needs to work on his timing with his receivers.

## Washington @ Panthers

Washington is playing very well. More rushing yardage than Carolina despite being their centers dropping like flies and Carolina probably running an offense prioritizing the rush.

Phil Snow and his love of the obvious 3-man pass rush is just pathetic. Questions were abound as to whether Snow was turning the corner, despite Carolina's defense being much better this year. Those questions are completely legitimate.

Christian McCaffrey is still the most important player on this offense, as charismatic as Cam may be.

Carolina's offense is pretty bad under Newton. I know Darnold has been nothing but a liability, but Cam Newton and his short passes aren't doing much for this offense, especially when negative game script rears its ugly head.

JD McKissic turning into a real force now that Washington's offensive line has gelled somewhat.

Carolina has serious coverage issues along the middle. And their critical down defense is just...questionable - Washington had the easiest time converting a fourth down at a crucial moment in the game.

## Cowboys @ Chiefs

Chiefs now committing to more short plays involving Tyreek Hill. Excellent adjustment, albeit a bit overdue.

I need to assess the Dallas interview tapes last week. I don't think they cared much about the game.

Terence Steele back to being a liability at left tackle. Frank Clark gifted a sack fumble.

Kellen Moore's offense is a real joy to watch sometimes. Dallas is fortunate to have two solid coordinators working for them.

Prescott targeting Gallup on multiple occasions fairly early in the game. Maybe missing Amari Cooper?

Tyreek Hill easily the best receiver in the NFL. The amount of attention defenses pay attention to him is astounding.

Tyrann Matthieu has had some notable plays in this game.

Prescott with a terrible pick. Underthrown ball to CeeDee Lamb results in an interception.

Travis Kelce has failed this offense on multiple passes. Not the easiest passes to catch, but Kelce is considered an elite tight end for a reason, no?

## Steelers @ Chargers

Without so many key starters, the Steelers defense is virtually handcuffed. Two deep safety looks are one of the few coverages they're running this game. Chargers have little issue working around them though. Herbert in particular has been exploiting this by running the ball himself.

Steelers have been money as usual on short crossing routes. Now if they run into a team with really good coverage linebackers....
