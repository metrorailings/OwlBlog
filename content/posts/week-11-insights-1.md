## Packers @ Vikings

Odd start so far to the game. Rodgers playing poorly, not respecting warnings from the officials and holding the ball way too long. The great question here has always been whether Rodgers can trust anybody else besides Davante Adams with the ball.

Green Bay coverage lapse led to a massive Justin Jefferson reception. 

Yet more poor coverage from the Packers. Kirk Cousins has been perfect so far in the first quarter.

Has Rodgers been slinging the ball too high when he throws out routes towards the sidelines?

One thing that's clear is that Minnesota not blitzing has frustrated Rodgers. He can't find an open receiver against their coverage shells. Are they masking coverage?

Kenny Clark is beasting as a pass rushing defensive tackle.

Rodgers playing like a little bitch. Cover-two is frustrating the hell out of him, though I suspect they also have Davante Adams wrapped up in bracket coverage. Randall Cobb not doing anything either...I wonder if he's even playing?

Perhaps Rodgers not practicing is what's hurting him here. No real confidence in any of his players.

Justin Jefferson now running routes out of the backfield...interesting. It's paid off tremendously on one drive.

Packers cannot hold up in man coverage against elite receivers.

## 49ers @ Jaguars

Deebo Samuel has been sensational so far as a tailback. Forget Jeff Wilson.

Texans winning, Jets looking pretty good...yet the one bad team I decide to back is Jacksonville. I need to read these bad teams better.

## Washington @ Panthers

Washington is playing very well. More rushing yardage than Carolina despite being their centers dropping like flies and Carolina probably running an offense prioritizing the rush.

Phil Snow and his love of the obvious 3-man pass rush is just pathetic. Questions were abound as to whether Snow was turning the corner, despite Carolina's defense being much better this year. Those questions are completely legitimate.

What a shitty early afternoon. The weird thing is I did a decent job handicapping these games as being tough to predict this week. So many of the games I've examined were going to be decided by level of effort, injury concerns, or a few in-game decisions. Bears are only in contention as Lamar Jackson is out with a mystery illness. Rashan Gary being unexpectedly out for the Packers may have been the key difference in the match, as Kirk Cousins was able to perform just well enough to lead his team to victory. Detroit fight hard enough to cover the spread despite starting a quarterback who's never started before in the NFL. Tennessee showed up to their game with the Texans drunk on bath salts. Jets were competitive through the game, although Miami managed to pull away with the win late.

Carolina and Jacksonville may have been indisputably bad decisions. And unsurprisingly, both decisions were made at the last moment as I struggled to find five games to play this week. Lesson learned - be careful putting games on my card that have been selected out of desperation. I knew Taylor Heinecke had that competitive spirit that could keep Washington's offense alive against Carolina's venerable defense. Objectively speaking, Heinecke is the better quarterback. Then again, so was Rodgers and look what happened there. I think lack of practice really hurt Rodgers this week, as Green Bay's offense was never able to develop a rhythm until the second half. Rodgers and Mac Jones are the type of passers that need practice to keep their relationships with their skill players sharp. I should have just stayed away from this contest knowing the Packers were bound to start slow.

The Eagles dominated the Saints, mostly because Philadelphia preyed on Trevor Siemien after New Orleans lost both their starting tackles this week to injury. It was wise of me to stay away from this game, as I had no idea whether New Orleans second-string tackles would hold up against Philadelphia's aggressive defensive front.

The problem with this week's slate of games is that too many of them were marred by uncertainty. Is Lamar going to play? Will Kirk Cousins help the Vikings jump out to an early lead while Aaron Rodgers takes his time to settle into his groove? Will New Orleans give Siemien enough time in the pocket to make his throws despite losing two critical book-end pieces on their offensive line? Will Tennessee even board the team bus today? Will San Francisco take it easy against a much-lesser opponent? Will Detroit's offense do just enough to give the Browns a run for their money?

Fuck this week.

## Cowboys @ Chiefs

Chiefs now committing to more short plays involving Tyreek Hill. Excellent adjustment, albeit a bit overdue.

I need to assess the Dallas interview tapes last week. I don't think they cared much about the game. 

Terence Steele back to being a liability at left tackle. Frank Clark gifted a sack fumble.

Kellen Moore's offense is a real joy to watch sometimes. Dallas is fortunate to have two solid coordinators working for them.
