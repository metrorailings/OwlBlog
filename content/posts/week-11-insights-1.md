## Packers @ Vikings

Odd start so far to the game. Rodgers playing poorly, not respecting warnings from the officials and holding the ball way too long. The great question here has always been whether Rodgers can trust anybody else besides Davante Adams with the ball.

Green Bay coverage lapse led to a massive Justin Jefferson reception. 

Yet more poor coverage from the Packers. Kirk Cousins has been perfect so far in the first quarter.

## 49ers @ Jaguars

Deebo Samuel has been sensational so far as a tailback. Forget Jeff Wilson.
