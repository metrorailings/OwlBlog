## Packers @ Vikings

Odd start so far to the game. Rodgers playing poorly, not respecting warnings from the officials and holding the ball way too long. The great question here has always been whether Rodgers can trust anybody else besides Davante Adams with the ball.

Green Bay coverage lapse led to a massive Justin Jefferson reception. 

Yet more poor coverage from the Packers. Kirk Cousins has been perfect so far in the first quarter.

Has Rodgers been slinging the ball too high when he throws out routes towards the sidelines?

One thing that's clear is that Minnesota not blitzing has frustrated Rodgers. He can't find an open receiver against their coverage shells. Are they masking coverage?

Kenny Clark is beasting as a pass rushing defensive tackle.

Rodgers playing like a little bitch. Cover-two is frustrating the hell out of him, though I suspect they also have Davante Adams wrapped up in bracket coverage. Randall Cobb not doing anything either...I wonder if he's even playing?

## 49ers @ Jaguars

Deebo Samuel has been sensational so far as a tailback. Forget Jeff Wilson.
