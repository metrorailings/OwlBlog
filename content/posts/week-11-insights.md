## Eagles @ Browns

Eagles defense standing tall against the Browns and their rushing attack so far. Cleveland was able to chew off a few notable runs, but nothing game-changing.

Late decision by Wentz gave Cleveland enough time to hit home on a delayed blitz that ultimately resulted in a pick-six.

How are outside runs giving the Browns so much trouble? Don't they see this shit every day in practice?

Cleveland using quite a few defensive back blitzes.

I wonder if Miles Sanders fumble on the first drive killed any faith Doug Pederson had in the running game...

Cleveland's deensive front is actually winning _without_ Myles Garrett! Philadelphia's tackles are just losing their battles against Olivier Vernon and Adrian Clayborn.

Jim Schwartz and his gap blitzes have ruined this Cleveland ground game. Why couldn't he do this his second week against Los Angeles? Though then again, the Rams made their bones that game with short passes from Jared Goff. Not sure if Cleveland has the willingness to restrain themselves to quick throws.

Defensive lines have been the story of this game, not the tailbacks. Impressive. I wasn't expecting that. Most of the biggest plays of this game came courtesy of defensive linemen setting offenses back.

Poor Carson Wentz. He'll be hurting tomorrow.

So the Eagles offense were so very limited in the second half, mostly because the Browns were so much better stopping the run. Something tells me Cleveland made a decision to play the rushing game more aggressively, no matter what. Arguably their best play in the half for the Eagles (while the game was still within reach) came on a bootleg that nobody on the Browns saw coming.

## Dolphins @ Broncos

The Dolphins trying to throw a fade in the red zone. It worked, but it's a disappointing play call.

Lock running to his left when the Dolphins ran a jailbreak blitz.

Broncos making more of a commitment to the pass in their scripted plays, unsurprisingly, even though their tailbacks are gashing the Dolphins on the ground. Still, some of these passes have been smartly in the form of quick throws and bootlegs.

Are these Dolphins struggling against the low altitude or are they just terrible at defensing the run?

Denver's defensive line is clowning this Miami offensive line. Props to Malik Reed for stepping up big and destroying the right side of Miami's offensive line.

Bootlegs and play actions throws down the middle seem to be bringing the best out of Lock.

T-E twists seem to bedevil Miami's offensive line.

Fitzmagic almost singlehandedly responsible for tying this game up.

## Packers @ Colts

Seems like Green Bay is selling out against the power run. Indianapolis made some hay on one drive with an end-around run followed up by a throw to a wide open Michael Pittman on a dagger route that caught Green Bay's coverage defenders _completely_ by surprise.

Negative game script doomed the next Colts drive.

Indianapolis defense stopped Green Bay's offense with their base cover-two defense on 3rd down.

Green Bay scored on a wide receiver where 3 receivers were paired up against 2 defensive backs. I wonder if these Colts are particular vulnerable against formations involving 3 wide receivers on one side of the field...

## Vikings @ Cowboys

Minnesota's cornerbacks may not be ready to defend against the run. I'm sure Mike Zimmer will correct that.

Dallas let up a touchdown in cover-two formation against Justin Jefferson running a route from the slot. Shameful.

Kirk Cousins may have a perfect passer rating here, but his failure to complete passes on two successive plays gave Dallas a legitimate shot to steal this game away from Minnesota. Kudos to Dallas defense for finally stepping up though at a critical moment.

Dallas showing some winning mettle to try and put this game in the win column.

Some motion in the backfield opened up a touchdown pass from Andy Dalton to Dalton Schultz, but Dallas did a terrible job managing the clock. Vikings still have a timeout in their pocket.

## Chiefs @ Raiders

Kansas City's defense is just spreading their legs open for the Raiders here. No coverage in the flat. Jumping offsides.

Robinson as the Chiefs' third receiver is just horrible. Cost his team on two drives. Sammy Watkins needs to come back.

Raiders defensive linemen are cutting inside hard against Kansas offensive line. It works every now and then - I notice Mahomes backpedaling quite a bit.

Maxx Crosby is easily the Raiders best defensive lineman.

Vegas pass protection has been phenomenal.

Defensive backs for the Raiders have been somewhat decent, though asking them to cover both Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce may be a bit much.

## Rams @ Buccaneers

One thing that became clear to me through the game was that Tampa's defense was ready for the Rams and their outside zone runs as well as their bootlegs. Los Angeles wasn't able to execute much running its base offense.

Jared Goff was absolute money though on short passes. Tampa's defensive strategy of playing soft zone along the flat didn't work. I suppose Bowles was anticipating that Los Angeles would run a lot more slants and crossing routes downfield. Instead, Goff threw his passes short throughout much of the game, perhaps as a way to negate any pressure from all the different ways Tampa's defense rushes the passer. His aDOT was likely below 5 yards.

Tampa's offense was actually prolific in the fist half, but completely emasculated in the second. Seems Los Angeles got more creative in their pass rushing and that forced some _ugly_ throws from Brady. Jalen Ramsey also held up much better in the second half after Mike Evans played him like a fiddle in the first.

The run game remains a major issue. It's so heavily based on power, but the Bucs offensive line don't have any juice. You need dogs along that offensive line if you expect to maul your way to a productive ground game.

## Titans @ Ravens

While the Ravens may be too predictable with their run plays, they were just money on a big play to Mark Andrews that came from 22 formation.

***

## Cardinals @ Seahawks

One play seemed to sum things up well - Russell Wilson had all the time in the pocket on a third-and-long, yet he couldn't find himself an outlet he liked. He threw a futile heave up for Carlos Hyde right before getting tackled by Haason Reddick.
