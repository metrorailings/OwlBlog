## Eagles @ Browns

Eagles defense standing tall against the Browns and their rushing attack so far. Cleveland was able to chew off a few notable runs, but nothing game-changing.

Late decision by Wentz gave Cleveland enough time to hit home on a delayed blitz that ultimately resulted in a pick-six.
