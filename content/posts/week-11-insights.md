## Eagles @ Browns

Eagles defense standing tall against the Browns and their rushing attack so far. Cleveland was able to chew off a few notable runs, but nothing game-changing.

Late decision by Wentz gave Cleveland enough time to hit home on a delayed blitz that ultimately resulted in a pick-six.

How are outside runs giving the Browns so much trouble? Don't they see this shit every day in practice?

Cleveland using quite a few defensive back blitzes.

I wonder if Miles Sanders fumble on the first drive killed any faith Doug Pederson had in the running game...

Cleveland's deensive front is actually winning _without_ Myles Garrett! Philadelphia's tackles are just losing their battles against Olivier Vernon and Adrian Clayborn.

Jim Schwartz and his gap blitzes have ruined this Cleveland ground game. Why couldn't he do this his second week against Los Angeles? Though then again, the Rams made their bones that game with short passes from Jared Goff. Not sure if Cleveland has the willingness to restrain themselves to quick throws.

Defensive lines have been the story of this game, not the tailbacks. Impressive. I wasn't expecting that. Most of the biggest plays of this game came courtesy of defensive linemen setting offenses back.

Poor Carson Wentz. He'll be hurting tomorrow.

So the Eagles offense were so very limited in the second half, mostly because the Browns were so much better stopping the run. Something tells me Cleveland made a decision to play the rushing game more aggressively, no matter what. Arguably their best play in the half for the Eagles (while the game was still within reach) came on a bootleg that nobody on the Browns saw coming.

## Dolphins @ Broncos

The Dolphins trying to throw a fade in the red zone. It worked, but it's a disappointing play call.
