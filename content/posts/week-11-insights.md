## Eagles @ Browns

Eagles defense standing tall against the Browns and their rushing attack so far. Cleveland was able to chew off a few notable runs, but nothing game-changing.

Late decision by Wentz gave Cleveland enough time to hit home on a delayed blitz that ultimately resulted in a pick-six.

How are outside runs giving the Browns so much trouble? Don't they see this shit every day in practice?

Cleveland using quite a few defensive back blitzes.

I wonder if Miles Sanders fumble on the first drive killed any faith Doug Pederson had in the running game...
