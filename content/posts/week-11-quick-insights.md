## Texans @ Ravens

Matthew Judon dominating against the run and at taking down the quarterback.

Deshaun Watson seems to be leaning too heavily on DeAndre Hopkins in the passing game. Lots of slants and even a deep heave in his direction on a critical 4th down play.

Ravens' defensive line has been a little sloppy with their aggressiveness. One bad penalty sustained an ultimately fruitless Texans drive. 

Houston's pass rush is nonexistent, as expected. Mercilus, Reader, nor Brennan Scarlet.

The Ravens and their cadre of tight ends are unique in this league. Mark Andrews catching a touchdown pass against a cornerback demonstrates his value as a pass catcher.

## Saints @ Buccaneers

Once again, Brees and Thomas haven't missed a beat with their connection whenever the latter runs flat routes. 

A bungled snap from Jameis nearly cost the Buccaneers a possession one yard away from the end zone. Luckily, the sack created additional space for the Tampa Bay offense that allowed Jameis to slide the ball towards a halfback running a post route against a linebacker for a touchdown.
