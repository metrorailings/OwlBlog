headline = "Week 11 Supercontest Picks"

+++
Man, I suck. I just suck. Last week was a bloodbath. Though about half my leanings were solid, the other half were outright horrible. And unfortunately , those were the picks I put on my Supercontest card.

Not sure if there's a theme or overarching lesson to be learned here. Perhaps7 don't doubt the better coaches in their respective matches. McDermott outcoached Kliff Kingsbury. McVay outcoached Pete Carroll. Jon Gruden clowned Vic Fangio and Pat Shurmur. Mike Zimmer laughed off Matt Nagy. Even Shanahan won the chess match with Sean Payton. Most of those coaches unsurprisingly covered their respective spreads, even if the game's outcome didn't necessarily fall in their favor.

Anyway, enough with all these white coaches. Let's get on this week.

### Eagles @ Browns (-3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Eagles (17) @ **Giants** (27)  
Texans (7) @ **Browns** (10)

#### _Record_

Eagles (6-3)  
Browns (3-5)

#### _Injuries_

Eagles are fairly healthy, though COVID will force Vinny Curry to be left home when Philadelphia travels to Cleveland.

COVID is also throwing Cleveland off its game here. Not only is Myles Garrett out, but starting tackle Jack Conklin may be ruled out should any of his COVID tests return back positive. Not good considering guard Wyatt Teller is injured as well.

#### _History_

Last meeting was four years ago. Still, something worth noting is that the Eagles have been terrible limiting opposing rushers the past few weeks. Perhaps it's something unique to division opponents, but it's worrying to see the Giants run hard against Philadelphia in both their matches this year.

The two times the Eagles have faced offenses that love their outside zone runs and bootlegs, results have been somewhat negative. The Rams blew them out early in the season. Philadelphia fared better against the 49ers, but the 49ers were missing so many critical playmakers on both sides of the ball, including their starting quarterback.

#### _Weather_

Cold and wet, but not that windy.

***

Browns -3.5

***

**Cleveland covers if**  
the Browns can possess the ball for more than 33 minutes. Carson Wentz and Miles Sanders need their touches kept to a minimum.

**Philadelphia covers if**  
the Eagles can retain possession of the ball for more than 27 minutes. Without Myles Garrett, Cleveland's pass rush fades from existence. Despite their commitment to failure, Philadelphia will have no choice but to score on some of their drives. Therefore, the key factor here becomes time - the Eagles simply need enough time to post a realistic shot at the cover, let alone win the game.

### Patriots @ Texans (+1.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Ravens (17) @ **Patriots** (23)  
Texans (7) @ **Browns** (10)

#### _Record_

Patriots (4-5)  
Texans (2-7)

#### _Injuries_

In true Patriot fashion, a bunch of their starters are listed on the injury report. Three starting offensive linemen, two defensive tackles, their starting tight end, a special teams ace, and a promising rookie halfback are all listed as questionable. While everybody is expected to play, it remains to be seen whether all of them can contribute at a high level. Stephon Gilmore also remains questionable to play, something particularly concerning given Deshaun Watson loves airing out the ball when the opportunity avails itself.

The Texans are so sad that few sources are bothering to even report on their injuries this week. I was forced to resort to using the Texans official injury report, which provides no context whatsoever. Even though a report can only tell me so much, it seems Laremy Tunsil is a real point of concern - he's been kept off the practice field all week with an "illness." In the COVID era, an illness designation is enough to keep a player out of the game

#### _History_

Houston's faced quite a few run-centric offenses this year. The results have been depressingly demoralizing for anybody rooting for this team - the Texans defense is absolutely pathetic against the ground game. Baltimore, Minnesota, Tennessee, Cleveland...all these teams have posted gaudy rushing numbers up against this incredibly soft Houston defensive front. Now comes the Patriots, rolling into town a week after beating the ball into the ground to the tune of 173 rushing yards.

But New England's defense has given up big plays too in the passing game this season - it's the reason opponents have been trying to abuse the unit with deep passes. Deshaun Watson should produce a few highlight plays here so long as Will Fuller and Brandin Cooks remain healthy.

#### _Weather_

Beautiful weather.

***

Patriots -1.5

***

**New England covers if**  
the team continues building upon the brand of football that won them the game last week against the Ravens.

**Houston covers if**  
Deshaun Watson and his two top receivers go absolutely buck wild against the Patriots defense. The defense will also need to keep New England away from its end zone on a clear majority of its drives. Probably unlikely if history has anything to say here.

### Falcons @ Saints (-4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

BYE - Broncos (27) @ **Falcons** (34)  
49ers (13) @ **Saints** (27)

#### _Record_

Falcons (3-6)  
Saints (7-2)

#### _Injuries_

Falcons will be missing the services of their second best pass-rushing defensive lineman in Dante Fowler, as he'll be kept out due to COVID concerns.

The Saints will be starting Taysom Hill at quarterback after Drew Brees is sidelined for several weeks as he suffers from multiple rib fractures. A little worrying, as Taysom never has quite shown any chops for passing the ball. Also a bit of a damning indictment on Jameis Winston. Unless maybe...Sean Payton's just playing games here to try and throw Atlanta into a bit of a frenzy as they continue preparing.

#### _History_

At first glance, last year's games don't seem to tell me much. The Falcons stunningly upset the Saints as 14-point underdogs in their first dogfight last year, thanks to some hard-nosed running and timely sacks. Their later meeting lived only slightly more up to expectations. While the Saints did win and barely cover, Atlanta held the ball for a ludicrous 35+ minutes. Teams that hold the ball over that long usually win. The Falcons tragically proved to be an exception to that rule.

Last year's games can only shed so much insight though. Taysom Hill being the starting quarterback for the Saints and Raheem Morris being the head coach for the Falcons changes the whole dynamic between these two teams.  It also introduces a whole bunch of unknowns.

***

N/A

***

**Atlanta covers if**  
the Falcons can establish their ground game here. A run game would ease Matt Ryan's workload and keep the Saints pass rushers from developing a rhythm.

**New Orleans covers if**  
Atlanta's ground game falters and Matt Ryan finds himself regularly harassed by the Saints defensive linemen.  
\- OR -  
Sean Payton and Taysom Hill actually end up engineering something spectacular on offense.

### Lions @ Panthers (-2.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Washington (27) @ **Lions** (30)  
**Buccaneers** (46) @ Panthers (23)

#### _Record_

Lions (4-5)  
Panthers (3-7)

#### _Injuries_

Lions will be without their two most explosive receivers in Danny Amendola and Kenny Golladay. Still, I suppose Detroit will make do with T.J. Hockenson, Marvin Jones, and D'Andre Swift.

Carolina has quite a few injury issues across their roster, the biggest one being Teddy Bridgewater. Seems like there's a real chance Bridgewater might not play, which means Will Grier is going to be the guy leading this offense.

#### _History_

Not sure what I can do to draw comparisons here. Detroit's defense is very slow and averse to blitzing, something that should bode well for Carolina and their quick passing game. Alex Smith almost led a heroic comeback against the Lions last week with a short passing game.

At the same time though, injuries will play a significant role here. Two of Carolina's offensive linemen will be out, and the Panthers are banged up at all three levels of their defense. The Lions are in better shape, despite being down two key weapons.

#### _Weather_

Lovely day for some football

***

Panthers -2.5

***

**Carolina covers if**  
Teddy Bridgewater can play and remain healthy through the game. Bridgewater's propensity to sacrifice his body to sustain drives worry me.  
\- OR -  
Will Grier can keep this offense humming along at a serviceable pace, should Teddy not be able to play. Much of that will depend on whether Matt Rhule and Joe Brady prep the kid adequately.

**Detroit covers if**  
Teddy cannot play and WIll Grier makes an ass of himself out there.

### Titans @ Ravens (-6.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Colts** (34) @ Titans (17)  
Ravens (17) @ **Patriots** (23)

#### _Record_

Titans (6-3)  
Ravens (6-3)

#### _Injuries_

Titans are in shoddy shape entering this contest. Not only is their best cornerback sidelined, but two of their better offensive linemen have also been ruled out. Center Ben Jones may join them as well.

Ravens are in slightly better health, but they'll be down their two best run defenders in Calais Campbell and Brandon Williams. So funnily enough, Tennessee's second-string offensive line versus Baltimore's weakened defensive front may be the battle that decides this game.

#### _History_

Tennessee ended Baltimore's Super Bowls hopes last year, thanks in part to  a monstrous rushing performance from Derrick Henry. But really, it's the fact that Tennessee sunk Baltimore into a hole early in the game that led to the latter's unraveling. The Ravens have serious issues playing from negative game script. Sure, Lamar Jackson was able to mount a comeback against the Colts, but that was more thanks to Philip Rivers killing drives early by playing like a geriatric in the second half. You give Lamar enough chances, eventually he'll find his groove.

It seems safe to say the Titans fortunes rest upon whether they can rattle off points faster than Baltimore here. And that's anything but certain given Tennessee has been _disgustingly incompetent_ defensing the run.

#### _Weather_

A little chilly, but otherwise decent.

***

Titans +6.5

***

**Tennessee covers if**  
the Titans offense can ball out and run up the score in the first two quarters.  The Ravens seem to have a habit of abandoning their rushing game plan once it becomes all too clear they're playing from behind.

**Baltimore covers if**  
the Ravens dominate time of possession by at least 6 minutes.  
\- OR -  
Baltimore can keep Tennessee's offense under their thumb. Certainly possible given that the Titans will be fielding a patchwork offensive line.

***

### Dolphins @ Broncos (+3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Chargers (21) @ **Dolphins** (29)  
Broncos (12) @ **Raiders** (37)

#### _Record_

Dolphins (6-3)  
Broncos (3-6)

#### _Injuries_

The Broncos are missing Bryce Callahan and possibly even Drew Lock. Callahan's absence is hard to swallow, as this team doesn't really have any quality depth behind their starting defensive backs. Drew Lock's absence would probably help this team greatly.

Dolphins could possibly miss team captain Kyle Van Noy when the game begins. Nothing debilitating, but significant nonetheless given the leadership he provides.

#### _History_

Last week proved that Drew Lock doesn't fare well at all against overload blitzes. That failure to handle the blitz with any sort of grace led to one of the worst showings from any quarterback this year.

Will Drew Lock learn from that experience? Safer to say no - bad quarterbacks rarely see the light and change their ways. Pat Shurmur seems hopeless as well - his refusal to run the ball more often with Phillip Lindsay smacks of foolishness. 

This is an offense without direction, drive, or moxie. Their only consistent success came against prevent defenses. Unfortunately for Denver, Miami isn't the type of team to play things safe.

#### _Weather_

Chilly

***

Dolphins -3.5

***

**Miami covers if**  
their cover-zero blitzes wipe out any credibility Drew Lock still holds as a starting quarterback. It would also help if Fangio refuses to finally pull the trigger on Brett Rypien until Miami is up by at least two scores.

**Denver covers if**  
the coaches put their faith in Philip Lindsay instead of the quarterbacks. For every pass play called, Pat Shurmur should call at least two running plays.  
\- OR -  
Brett Rypien comes in early to replace Drew Lock and he actually shows some of that promise fans were expecting to see from Lock.

***

### Rams @ Buccaneers (-4)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Seahawks (16) @ **Rams** (23)  
**Buccaneers** (46) @ Panthers (23)

#### _Record_

Rams (6-3)  
Buccaneers (7-3)

#### _Injuries_

Los Angeles will start testing their depth starting this week. With Taylor Rapp, Andrew Whitworth, and Kai Forbath going to IR, the Rams will need to rely on their understudies to keep the team humming in all three phases.

Tampa Bay will possibly miss left guard Ali Marpet, as he's still dealing with a concussion.

#### _History_

Brady and this offense was dismantled only a few weeks ago by the Saints who came in with a fantastic game plan - disguise coverage so that Brady has to hold the ball a tick longer than normal. That extra time was all their pass rushers needed to harass Brady. It's a strategy the Rams defense should be able to copy with ease given the way they're built.

Still, this season has once again shown that the Rams are vulnerable themselves to any sort of pressure. And Tampa's defense prides itself on the variety of ways it can manufacture pressure through blitzes.   

#### _Weather_

Cool and moderately humid

***

Rams +4

***

**Los Angeles covers if**  
their defense borrows heavily from the Saints defensive game plan. Sean McVay also needs to make sure Jared Goff isn't exposed to too much pressure. The poor boy can only handle so much violence.

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
their blitz packages gives Jared Goof the shakes. Certainly possible as that offensive line is missing its heart and soul in Andrew Whitworth.

***

### Chiefs @ Raiders (+7.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

BYE - Panthers (31) @ **Chiefs** (33)  
Broncos (12) @ **Raiders** (37)

#### _Results_

Chiefs (8-1)  
Raiders (6-3)

#### _Injuries_

The Chiefs are mostly healthy coming off the bye, though they'll be missing their best tackle in Mitchell Schwartz.

The Raiders are remarkably healthy, but the bigger concern is the fact that the most of the starters on defense have not adequately practiced throughout the week, due to COVID concerns. Then again, is practice really necessary against an opponent the organization knows all too well?

#### _History_

The Raiders embarrassed the Chiefs as double-digit underdogs earlier in the season. Deep passes to Henry Ruggs and ball control through the ground game proved to be the winning formula for Las Vegas that week. Can they repeat the same strategy again this week? Not sure. One thing history tells me though - you don't fuck with Andy Reid coming off a bye.

***

Chiefs -7.5

***

**Kansas City covers if**  
Andy Reid crafted a master game plan during the bye week against a rival who was all too happy gloating about their win earlier in the season.

**Las Vegas covers if**  
they can execute yet again on the same strategy that won them the game in Kansas City.
