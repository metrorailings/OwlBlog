Man, I suck. I just suck. Last week was a bloodbath. Though about half my leanings were solid, the other half were outright horrible. And unfortunately , those were the picks I put on my Supercontest card.

Not sure if there's a theme or overarching lesson to be learned here. Perhaps7 don't doubt the better coaches in their respective matches. McDermott outcoached Kliff Kingsbury. McVay outcoached Pete Carroll. Jon Gruden clowned Vic Fangio and Pat Shurmur. Mike Zimmer laughed off Matt Nagy. Even Shanahan won the chess match with Sean Payton. Most of those coaches unsurprisingly covered their respective spreads, even if the game's outcome didn't necessarily fall in their favor.

Anyway, enough with all these white coaches. Let's get on this week.

### Eagles @ Browns (-3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Eagles (17) @ **Giants** (27)  
Texans (7) @ **Browns** (10)

#### _Record_

Eagles (6-3)  
Browns (3-5)

#### _Injuries_

Eagles are fairly healthy, though COVID will force Vinny Curry to be left home when Philadelphia travels to Cleveland.

COVID is also throwing Cleveland off its game here. Not only is Myles Garrett out, but starting tackle Jack Conklin may be ruled out should any of his COVID tests return back positive. Not good considering guard Wyatt Teller is injured as well.
