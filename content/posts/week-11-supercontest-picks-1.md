headline = "Week 11 Supercontest Picks"

+++
Man, I suck. I just suck. Last week was a bloodbath. Though about half my leanings were solid, the other half were outright horrible. And unfortunately , those were the picks I put on my Supercontest card.

Not sure if there's a theme or overarching lesson to be learned here. Perhaps7 don't doubt the better coaches in their respective matches. McDermott outcoached Kliff Kingsbury. McVay outcoached Pete Carroll. Jon Gruden clowned Vic Fangio and Pat Shurmur. Mike Zimmer laughed off Matt Nagy. Even Shanahan won the chess match with Sean Payton. Most of those coaches unsurprisingly covered their respective spreads, even if the game's outcome didn't necessarily fall in their favor.

Anyway, enough with all these white coaches. Let's get on this week.

### Eagles @ Browns (-3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Eagles (17) @ **Giants** (27)  
Texans (7) @ **Browns** (10)

#### _Record_

Eagles (6-3)  
Browns (3-5)

#### _Injuries_

Eagles are fairly healthy, though COVID will force Vinny Curry to be left home when Philadelphia travels to Cleveland.

COVID is also throwing Cleveland off its game here. Not only is Myles Garrett out, but starting tackle Jack Conklin may be ruled out should any of his COVID tests return back positive. Not good considering guard Wyatt Teller is injured as well.

#### _History_

Last meeting was four years ago. Still, something worth noting is that the Eagles have been terrible limiting opposing rushers the past few weeks. Perhaps it's something unique to division opponents, but it's worrying to see the Giants run hard against Philadelphia in both their matches this year.

The two times the Eagles have faced offenses that love their outside zone runs and bootlegs, results have been somewhat negative. The Rams blew them out early in the season. Philadelphia fared better against the 49ers, but the 49ers were missing so many critical playmakers on both sides of the ball, including their starting quarterback.

#### _Weather_

Cold and wet, but not that windy.

Browns -3.5

***

**Cleveland covers if**  
the Browns can possess the ball for more than 33 minutes. Carson Wentz and Miles Sanders need their touches kept to a minimum.

**Philadelphia covers if**  
the Eagles can retain possession of the ball for more than 27 minutes. Without Myles Garrett, Cleveland's pass rush fades from existence. Despite their commitment to failure, Philadelphia will have no choice but to score on some of their drives. Therefore, the key factor here becomes time - the Eagles simply need enough time to post a realistic shot at the cover, let alone win the game.

### Patriots @ Texans (+1.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Ravens (17) @ **Patriots** (23)  
Texans (7) @ **Browns** (10)

#### _Record_

Patriots (4-5)  
Texans (2-7)

#### _Injuries_

In true Patriot fashion, a bunch of their starters are listed on the injury report. Three starting offensive linemen, two defensive tackles, their starting tight end, a special teams ace, and a promising rookie halfback are all listed as questionable. While everybody is expected to play, it remains to be seen whether all of them can contribute at a high level. Stephon Gilmore also remains questionable to play, something particularly concerning given Deshaun Watson loves airing out the ball when the opportunity avails itself.

The Texans are so sad that few sources are bothering to even report on their injuries this week. I was forced to resort to using the Texans official injury report, which provides no context whatsoever. Even though a report can only tell me so much, it seems Laremy Tunsil is a real point of concern - he's been kept off the practice field all week with an "illness." In the COVID era, an illness designation is enough to keep a player out of the game 

#### _History_

Houston's faced quite a few run-centric offenses this year. The results have been depressingly demoralizing for anybody rooting for this team - the Texans defense is absolutely pathetic against the ground game. Baltimore, Minnesota, Tennessee, Cleveland...all these teams have posted gaudy rushing numbers up against this incredibly soft Houston defensive front. Now comes the Patriots, rolling into town a week after beating the ball into the ground to the tune of 173 rushing yards.

But New England's defense has given up big plays too in the passing game this season - it's the reason opponents have been trying to abuse the unit with deep passes. Deshaun Watson should produce a few highlight plays here so long as Will Fuller and Brandin Cooks remain healthy.

#### _Weather_

Beautiful weather.

***

Patriots -1.5

***

**New England covers if**  
the team continues building upon the brand of football that won them the game last week against the Ravens.

**Houston covers if**  
Deshaun Watson and his two top receivers go absolutely buck wild against the Patriots defense. The defense will also need to keep New England away from its end zone on a clear majority of its drives. Probably unlikely if history has anything to say here.

### Falcons @ Saints (-4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

BYE - Broncos (27) @ **Falcons** (34)  
49ers (13) @ **Saints** (27)

#### _Record_

Falcons (3-6)  
Saints (7-2)

#### _Injuries_

Falcons will be missing the services of their second best pass-rushing defensive lineman in Dante Fowler, as he'll be kept out due to COVID concerns.

The Saints will be starting Taysom Hill at quarterback after Drew Brees is sidelined for several weeks as he suffers from multiple rib fractures. A little worrying, as Taysom never has quite shown any chops for passing the ball. Also a bit of a damning indictment on Jameis Winston. Unless, of course...Sean Payton's just playing games here to try and throw Atlanta into a bit of a frenzy as they prepare for the game.
