#### Saints @ Buccaneers (+5.5)

Not the biggest fan of taking road favorites, but the Saints are coming off a horrific loss to an opponent that really had no standing to beat them. New Orleans clearly lost focus coming off the bye. That focus should be in place after the loss.

Now cue this game against the Buccaneers. As I noted before, Tampa Bay has a tendency to struggle against division opponents. While I can't say for sure why, it may be related to the fact that division opponents have more inside information about Jameis Winston and his sloppy tendencies. Carolina shellacking the Buccaneers in their second go-around is evidence of this, though it's worth noting that game took place in London.

Regardless, I expect those same struggles to surface again here against a capable Saints defense, even if it's missing the services of its best defensive back in Marshon Lattimore.

The only thing that concerns me is Drew Brees' unwillingness to throw deep against this season. It seems age caught up to him. Either way, he'll need to throw deep against a secondary riddled with weak points all over should New Orleans want to win comfortably.
