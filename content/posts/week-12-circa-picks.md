What a shitty week. The weird thing is I did a decent job handicapping these games as being tough to predict this week. So many of the games I've examined were going to be decided either by level of effort, injury concerns, or a few in-game decisions. Bears were only in contention as Lamar Jackson is out with a mystery illness. Rashan Gary being unexpectedly out for the Packers may have been the key difference in the match, as Kirk Cousins was able to perform just well enough to lead his team to victory. Detroit managed to cover the spread thanks in large part to Cleveland sleepwalking through the game. Tennessee showed up to their affair with the Texans drunk on bath salts. Jets were competitive through the game, although Miami managed to pull away with the win late.

Carolina and Jacksonville may have been indisputably bad decisions. And unsurprisingly, both decisions were made at the last moment as I struggled to find five games to play this week. Lesson learned - be careful putting games on the card while desperate. I knew Taylor Heinecke had that competitive spirit that could keep Washington's offense alive against Carolina's venerable defense. Objectively speaking, Heinecke is the better quarterback. Then again, so was Rodgers and look what happened there. I think lack of practice really hurt Rodgers this week, as Green Bay's offense was never able to develop a rhythm until the second half. Rodgers and Mac Jones are the type of passers that need practice to maintain chemistry with their skill players. I should have just stayed away from this contest knowing the Packers were bound to start slow.

The Eagles dominated the Saints, mostly because Philadelphia preyed on Trevor Siemien after New Orleans lost both their starting tackles this week to injury. It was wise of me to stay away from this game, as I had no idea whether New Orleans second-string tackles would hold up against Philadelphia's aggressive defensive front.

The problem with this week's slate of games is that too many of them were marred by uncertainty. Is Lamar going to play? Will Kirk Cousins help the Vikings jump out to an early lead while Aaron Rodgers takes his time settling into a groove? Will New Orleans give Siemien enough time in the pocket to make his throws despite losing two critical book-end pieces on their offensive line? Will Tennessee even board the team bus today? Will San Francisco take it easy against a much-lesser opponent? Will Detroit's offense do just enough to give the Browns a run for their money?

Perhaps the best lesson I can take away is that level of effort is a very real consideration. How one can predict whether a team shows up fully invested in the game remains horribly hazy. I do have a working theory though, built on a simple premise - teams who perceive their next opponent to be a pushover will not commit wholly to their next game. This perception can **_possibly_** be discerned for any given game by examining the magnitude of the spread, looking at public perception, and comparing the outcomes of the last games the two teams were engaged in prior.

### Panthers @ Dolphins (+2)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**_Washington_** @ Panthers  
**_Dolphins_** @ Jets

#### _Key Injuries_

Panthers will be without one of their starting guards.

Dolphins will likely lose Mike Gesicki for the week, leaving them without one of their biggest contributors on offense.

#### _History_

No real relevant history to explore here, given both teams belong to different conferences. A few weeks back, Miami managed to play well against a Raven team that (much like the Cam Newton-led Panthers) generates most of its success transiting the ball over ground instead of through the air, but that game was likely tainted by a lack of effort on the Baltimore's part - Baltimore had way too many excuses not to fully commit to that game - heavy favorites playing on a Thursday after surviving an overtime contest against Minnesota.

#### _Weather_

Beautiful day for some football

***

Dolphins +2

***

**Carolina covers if**  
their defensive front completely dominates Miami's overmatched offensive line. If Tua's constantly beset by pressure, mistakes are all but assured  
\- AND -  
Miami doesn't do enough on their end to keep Christian McCaffrey and Cam Newton from popping off through read-action plays.

**Miami covers if**  
Tua and company can string together multiple scoring drives through short passes, probably through a combination of screens, slants, and hitch routes.  
\- AND -  
Miami's coverage people can haggle some turnovers from Cam, with some assistance from blitzes.

### Falcons @ Jaguars (+1)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**_Patriots_** @ Falcons  
**_49ers_** @ Jaguars

#### _Key Injuries_

Falcons are hoping to welcome Hayden Hurst back into the fold after a disastrous showing last week against New England.

Jaguars took their fair share of blows last week, but the biggest blow may be to cornerback Shaquill Griffin, who was lost to concussion during the loss to the 49ers. Without Shaquill, the Jaguars will need to consult more depth players to man a secondary already rated as one of the league's absolute worst.

#### _History_

Not much relevant history to explore here, but it's worth stating that both teams rank among the bottom-feeders of the league.

#### _Weather_

Temperate with lower-than-expected humidity

***

Falcons -1

***

**Atlanta covers if**  
they're fully committed to playing in top form against a team many people see as a lesser opponent. It won't be easy maintaining focus given it's a road game as well.

**Jacksonville covers if**  
the Falcons are caught slacking off, giving these Jaguars more than enough opportunity to post points on the board.

***

### Titans @ Patriots (-6.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**_Jaguars_** @ Texans  
**_Patriots_** @ Falcons (TNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

A.J. Brown may be unavailable due to a chest injury Sunday. If so, it would leave the Titans bereft of any real talented skill players on their offense. They'll once again rely on somewhat untested prospects like Nick Westbrook-Ikhine to carry the load on offense.

New England's mostly healthy, albeit a little banged up.

#### _History_

The Titans and Patriots were contending against one another in the wild-card round of the postseason two years ago. Tennessee was able to triumph thanks to a ground game headlined by Derrick Henry as well as the Patriot offense stalling way too much.

The biggest change this year comes with New England featuring a rookie quarterback joined by an assortment of weapons at his disposal. Stalling is very unlikely to be a defining theme for the Patriots this week.

#### _Weather_

Cold, but not much rain or wind expected

***

Uncertain

***

**New England covers if**  
the Titans are simply unable to overcome all their deficiencies on offense and defense

**Tennessee covers if**  
the coaches manage to work around all the injuries robbing them of their key weapons on offense. D'Onta Foreman and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine will need to play as if they're critical facets of the offense  
\- OR -  
the Patriots aren't fully committed to the game, given the Titans are seen as inferior given their injury cases as well as the embarrassing loss they suffered last week against the ugliest team in the league in the Houston Texans.

### Eagles @ Giants (+3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Saints @ **_Eagles_**  
Giants @ **_Buccaneers_** (MNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

For the Eagles, Darius Slay is expected out with a concussion. Without him, Philadelphia loses its most dynamic playmaker on defense.

Both Sterling Shepard and Kadarius Toney are names to watch on the Giants injury report going forward. Toney is especially considering his name was freshly added this week. He's been dealing with a whole bunch of issues this year, so his presence is anything but definite this Sunday.

#### _History_

Last time these two met, the Giants won decisively despite being 5-point underdogs. In all fairness though, that game took place with Carson Wentz and Doug Pederson directing the Eagle offense. Hurts and Sirianni has transformed that unit into something dramatically different  Passes now only serve to complement a ground game centered around Hurts executing read-option plays. Can the Giants effectively defense that style of offense? Not too sure - their run defense has produced mixed results. On top of that, Philadelphia managed to pound the ball against the league's best rushing defense last week.

#### _Weather_

Chilly with a slight chance of precipitation

***

Giants +3.5

***

**New York covers if**  
At least one of Toney or Sterling Shepard are active and able to contribute  
\- AND -  
the sudden firing of Jason Garrett sparks some much-needed life back into this offense.

**Philadelphia covers if**  
the offense can run its ground game without any abatement whatsoever from the Giant defense.

***

### Buccaneers @ Colts (+3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Giants @ **_Buccaneers_** (MNF)  
**_Colts_** @ Bills

#### _Key Injuries_

Vita Vea has trended in the right direction and is on track to play. But the good news stops there for Tampa. Devin White, Mike Edwards, Mike Evans, and Antonio Brown are dealing with injuries serious enough to sideline them this Sunday. The biggest concerns here are Evans and Brown. Without either one, the Buccaneers are missing that signature outside receiving threat.

Colts are mostly healthy - Quenton Nelson aggravated an ankle injury last Sunday that'll likely keep him off the field for a week or two.

#### _History_

No recent history between the two given this is an inter-conference match-up. It's been years since Frank Reich tangled wits with the likes of Bruce Arians and Tom Brady. Though we do have a couple things worth noting here.

First, the Colts owe their success over the past few weeks to the efficacy of their rushing attack, headlined by potential MVP Jonathan Taylor. Carson Wentz has contributed little value on top of the ground game, so it's virtually certain their ability to win hinges on whether they're able to churn the rock over ground.

Second, the Buccaneers have been uncannily underwhelming on the road this season. It's possible road games just haven't been kind to them this year as a matter of circumstance, but they've yet to cover so far outside of Raymond James stadium.

#### _Weather_

Dome game

***

Buccaneers -3

***

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
Todd Bowles structures his defense to sell out and stop Jonathan Taylor and company. If the Colts are to win the game, it would have to be on the shoulders of Carson Wentz. And he's yet to demonstrate this season he can carry such a burden.

**Indianapolis covers if**  
their ground game consistently produces over all four quarters, helping them dominate time of possession  
\- OR -  
Tampa Bay's road curse dooms them here. It's silly to think the team is cursed, but until they finally manage to cover a spread on the road, it's a legitimate worry to keep in mind.

### Steelers @ Bengals (-4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

_Steelers_ @ **Chargers** (SNF)  
**_Bengals_** @ Raiders

#### _Key Injuries_

Pittsburgh should see most of their key defensive personnel return this week after missing last week's contest against the Chargers. Minkah Fitzpatrick, Joe Haden, and Isaiah Loudermilk are primed to return. T.J. Watt is only practicing in limited capacity given the nature of his injuries - his status is questionable this weekend, though things are trending towards him starting. Pittsburgh may also suffer a critical hit to their offensive line now that their starting center is out with a pectoral injury.

Bengals are refreshingly healthy for once.

#### _History_

The Bengals were able to pull an upset over Pittsburgh earlier in the year on Heinz Field, mostly thanks to the efforts of Joe Mixon and their offensive line. It was a milestone victory too, a win against a Steeler defense many still saw as being one of the best in the league.

Cincinnati has since improved slightly, better incorporating Tyler Boyd and JaMarr Chase into the fold of their offense. Pittsburgh seems to have improved marginally as well, if last week is any indication.

#### _Weather_

Cold with winds reaching up to 15 miles per hour

***

Bengals -4.5

***

**Cincinnati covers if**  
their running game and quick passes find success again this week against a Pittsburgh team the Bengals have beaten before  
\- AND -  
Joe Burrow continues playing at a higher level than Ben Roethlisberger.

**Pittsburgh covers if**  
their defensive front can besiege Joe Burrow on a regular basis, forcing him to commit ugly mistakes. Rattling Burrow consistently is the only way the Steelers can level the playing field at quarterback.

***

### Rams @ Packers (PK)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Rams @ **_49ers_** (MNF) \[Bye\]  
Packers @ **_Vikings_**

#### _Key Injuries_

Packers will miss fill-in left tackle Elgton Jenkins for the rest of the year, as he went down last week with a torn ACL. Rashan Gary was a surprise inactive last week, despite his presence in all practice sessions last week. So his status this week is anything but guaranteed, especially if the team keeps insisting that he attended practices in "limited capacity." Aaron Jones remains only a possibility to return at this point - he's been practicing, but his health is still being monitored and Matt LaFleur refuses to state anything reassuring about his game time availability. Perhaps most troubling for Green Bay is that Aaron Rodgers is allegedly dealing with a fractured toe. It's not going to sideline him, but I do expect the fracture to limit him in some respect.

The Rams are only worried about Leonard Floyd, who's apparently returning from a vicious concussion. McVay expects him to play this Sunday, but as we've seen before with Rashan Gary, injuries can linger and fester.

#### _History_

Both these teams faced one another last year in the postseason - Green Bay won decisively by riding behind Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams as the two of them slashed their way through the Ram defense. Even though Los Angeles was ranked as one of the better teams last year defensing the run, the reality was that it was only a matter of time before an opponent would finally exploit their lightly-manned boxes. Green Bay was that opponent, ripping through their six-man boxes through some well-blocked zone rushes.

This year, it can be argued the Rams have improved, at least in terms of offensive personnel. Likewise, people have made similar arguments for the Packers and their defensive coaching. Let this game be a good barometer as to whether any of those two assertions bear merit.

#### _Weather_

Few degrees above freezing, with winds reaching upwards of 20 miles per hour

***

Undecided

***

**Los Angeles covers if**  
their offense finally rounds into form after two humiliating losses and a bye week. Stafford has the raw ability to elevate this offense past its ceiling from last year, but he needs to be more comfortable operating from within the structure of McVay's system. On top of that, Odell Beckham needs to be made a critical part of this offense, now that Robert Woods will no longer be the team's primary receiving threat on the outside.

**Green Bay covers if**  
Aaron Jones, Rashan Gary, and Aaron Rodgers all play in top form  
\- OR -  
the offense once again strikes gold pounding the ball along turf, this time with AJ Dillon as the bell-cow at tailback.

***

### Browns @ Ravens (-3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

_Lions_ @ **Browns  
Ravens** @ _Bears_

#### _Key Injuries_

For the Browns, their biggest issue still remains Baker Mayfield. It's bad enough he's not the sharpest tool in the box, but injuries only make him play worse. In positive news though, almost every other key player is expected to play, including Kareem Hunt and Jack Conklin.

The Ravens secondary is horribly banged up, but most of its players are expected to play in some capacity. Lamar Jackson is probable though.

#### _History_

Last year, the Ravens housed the Browns twice. In fact, it was the second game against in Cleveland where Baltimore rediscovered their groove. Joe Woods can't help but cough up points against this Raven offense, despite the fact that his defense should be intimately familiar with Lamar Jackson and all his tricks.

Things are expected to be a bit worse this year for Cleveland, as Don Martindale now had a whole year to study Stefanski's style of offense.

#### _Weather_

Cold, with some winds blowing about at roughly 10 miles an hour

***

Ravens -3.5

***

**Baltimore covers if**  
Joe Woods can do nothing but shrug his shoulders as his defense is once again steamrolled by Baltimore, as is tradition  
\- OR -  
Baker Mayfield's injuries hinder him hard again.

**Cleveland covers if  
**Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt take over and keep the Ravens offense on the sidelines. Cleveland should target to keep the ball for over 38 minutes.

***

### Seahawks @ Washington (-1)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**_Cardinals_** @ Seahawks  
**_Washington_** @ Panthers

#### _Key Injuries_

No serious injury concerns for the Seahawks. D.K. Metcalf was listed as a non-participant on Thursday's practice report, but nothing credible is out there indicating he may be sidelined.

Likewise, Washington doesn't have any serious injuries holding any of their players back. Though both rosters have personnel dealing with various afflictions, Monday night should see two teams playing one another at nearly full strength.

#### _History_

Both of these teams met last year at FedEx Field. The Seahawks managed to edge out Washington, though they failed to cover the spread. Though then again, it's hard to blame them for not covering when they were facing the man, the myth, the legend himself....Dwayne Haskins. Yeah.....Dwayne Haskins.

While I plan on rewatching this game later, it's pretty damning the Seahawks could only muster a 5-point win against a Washington offense led by a complete scrub. I know their defense was playing at a heightened level last year, but one can say the same for the defense this year, given their performances the last few weeks against Tampa Bay and Carolina.

#### _Weather_

Typical November weather, cold but not too cold

***

Washington -1

***

**Washington covers if**  
jazzed up by the spotlights and the eyes of the nation, Taylor Heinecke outplays Russell Wilson on a yards-per-pass basis.

**Seattle covers if**  
Russell actually lives up to his mantra and finally starts cooking, outperforming his counterpart on Washington on a yards-per-pass basis.
