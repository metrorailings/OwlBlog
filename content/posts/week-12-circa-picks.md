What a shitty week. The weird thing is I did a decent job handicapping these games as being tough to predict this week. So many of the games I've examined were going to be decided either by level of effort, injury concerns, or a few in-game decisions. Bears were only in contention as Lamar Jackson is out with a mystery illness. Rashan Gary being unexpectedly out for the Packers may have been the key difference in the match, as Kirk Cousins was able to perform just well enough to lead his team to victory. Detroit managed to cover the spread thanks in large part to Cleveland sleepwalking through the game. Tennessee showed up to their affair with the Texans drunk on bath salts. Jets were competitive through the game, although Miami managed to pull away with the win late.

Carolina and Jacksonville may have been indisputably bad decisions. And unsurprisingly, both decisions were made at the last moment as I struggled to find five games to play this week. Lesson learned - be careful putting games on the card while desperate. I knew Taylor Heinecke had that competitive spirit that could keep Washington's offense alive against Carolina's venerable defense. Objectively speaking, Heinecke is the better quarterback. Then again, so was Rodgers and look what happened there. I think lack of practice really hurt Rodgers this week, as Green Bay's offense was never able to develop a rhythm until the second half. Rodgers and Mac Jones are the type of passers that need practice to maintain chemistry with their skill players. I should have just stayed away from this contest knowing the Packers were bound to start slow.

The Eagles dominated the Saints, mostly because Philadelphia preyed on Trevor Siemien after New Orleans lost both their starting tackles this week to injury. It was wise of me to stay away from this game, as I had no idea whether New Orleans second-string tackles would hold up against Philadelphia's aggressive defensive front.

The problem with this week's slate of games is that too many of them were marred by uncertainty. Is Lamar going to play? Will Kirk Cousins help the Vikings jump out to an early lead while Aaron Rodgers takes his time settling into a groove? Will New Orleans give Siemien enough time in the pocket to make his throws despite losing two critical book-end pieces on their offensive line? Will Tennessee even board the team bus today? Will San Francisco take it easy against a much-lesser opponent? Will Detroit's offense do just enough to give the Browns a run for their money?

Perhaps the best lesson I can take away is that level of effort is a very real consideration. How one can predict whether a team shows up fully invested in the game remains horribly hazy. I do have a working theory though, built on a simple premise - teams who perceive their next opponent to be a pushover will not commit wholly to their next game. This perception can **_possibly_** be discerned for any given game by examining the magnitude of the spread, looking at public perception, and comparing the outcomes of the last games the two teams were engaged in prior.

### Panthers @ Dolphins (+1.5)

#### _Latest Results_

**_Washington_** @ Panthers  
**_Dolphins_** @ Jets

#### _Key Injuries_

Dolphins aren't missing anybody critical from last week, though the injury report will tell us more.

The Panthers starting left tackle went down with injury during their outing against Washington last week. A rookie was placed there in relief duty and performed well enough, though it remains to be seen whether he can sustain that level of play over multiple weeks.

#### _History_

No real relevant histroy to explore here, given both teams belong to different conferences. A few weeks back, Miami managed to play well against a Raven team that (much like the Cam Newton-led Panthers) generates more of its success transiting the ball over ground instead of through the air, but that game was likely tainted by a lack of effort on the Baltimore's part - Baltimore had way too many excuses not to fully commit to that game - heavy favorites playing on a Thursday after surviving an overtime contest against Minnesota.

Beautiful day for some football

Panthers -1.5

**Carolina covers if**  
their defensive front completely dominates Miami's overmatched offensive line. If Tua's constantly beset by pressure, mistakes are all but assured  
\- AND -  
Miami doesn't do enough on their end to keep Christian McCaffrey and Cam Newton from popping off through read-action plays.

**Miami covers if**  
Tua and company can string together multiple scoring drives through short passes  
\- AND -  
Miami's coverage people can haggle some turnovers from Cam, with some assistance from blitzes.

### Falcons @ Jaguars (+1)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**_Patriots_** @ Falcons  
**_49ers_** @ Jaguars

#### _Key Injuries_

Falcons are hoping to welcome Hayden Hurst back into the fold after a disastrous showing last week against New England.

Jaguars took their fair share of blows last week, but the biggest blow may be to cornerback Shaquill Griffin, who was lost to concussion during the loss to the 49ers. Without Shaquill, the Jaguars will need to consult more depth players to man a secondary already rated as one of the league's absolute worst.

#### _History_

Not much relevant history to explore here, but it's worth stating that both teams rank among the bottom-feeders of the league.

#### _Weather_

Temperate with lower-than-expected humidity

Falcons -1

***

**Atlanta covers if**  
they're fully committed to playing in top form against a team many people see as a lesser opponent. It won't be easy maintaining focus given it's a road game as well.

**Jacksonville covers if**  
the Falcons are caught slacking off, giving these Jaguars more than enough opportunity to post points on the board.

### Titans @ Patriots (-6.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**_Jaguars_** @ Texans  
**_Patriots_** @ Falcons (TNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

A.J. Brown may be unavailable due to a chest injury Sunday. If so, it would leave the Titans bereft of any real talented skill players on their offense. They'll once again rely on somewhat untested prospects like Nick Westbrook-Ikhine to carry the load on offense.

New England's mostly healthy, albeit a little banged up.
