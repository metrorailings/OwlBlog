What a shitty week. The weird thing is I did a decent job handicapping these games as being tough to predict this week. So many of the games I've examined were going to be decided either by level of effort, injury concerns, or a few in-game decisions. Bears were only in contention as Lamar Jackson is out with a mystery illness. Rashan Gary being unexpectedly out for the Packers may have been the key difference in the match, as Kirk Cousins was able to perform just well enough to lead his team to victory. Detroit managed to cover the spread thanks in large part to Cleveland sleepwalking through the game. Tennessee showed up to their affair with the Texans drunk on bath salts. Jets were competitive through the game, although Miami managed to pull away with the win late.

Carolina and Jacksonville may have been indisputably bad decisions. And unsurprisingly, both decisions were made at the last moment as I struggled to find five games to play this week. Lesson learned - be careful putting games on the card while desperate. I knew Taylor Heinecke had that competitive spirit that could keep Washington's offense alive against Carolina's venerable defense. Objectively speaking, Heinecke is the better quarterback. Then again, so was Rodgers and look what happened there. I think lack of practice really hurt Rodgers this week, as Green Bay's offense was never able to develop a rhythm until the second half. Rodgers and Mac Jones are the type of passers that need practice to maintain chemistry with their skill players. I should have just stayed away from this contest knowing the Packers were bound to start slow.

The Eagles dominated the Saints, mostly because Philadelphia preyed on Trevor Siemien after New Orleans lost both their starting tackles this week to injury. It was wise of me to stay away from this game, as I had no idea whether New Orleans second-string tackles would hold up against Philadelphia's aggressive defensive front.

The problem with this week's slate of games is that too many of them were marred by uncertainty. Is Lamar going to play? Will Kirk Cousins help the Vikings jump out to an early lead while Aaron Rodgers takes his time settling into a groove? Will New Orleans give Siemien enough time in the pocket to make his throws despite losing two critical book-end pieces on their offensive line? Will Tennessee even board the team bus today? Will San Francisco take it easy against a much-lesser opponent? Will Detroit's offense do just enough to give the Browns a run for their money?

Perhaps the best lesson I can take away is that level of effort is a very real consideration.
