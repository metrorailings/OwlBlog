## Raiders @ Cowboys

Anthony Brown with two critical pass interference penalties on 3rd down on a single drive, leading to a Raiders touchdown. Aggressive man coverage giveth and aggressive man coverage taketh.

Dak is not having a good game. Not in the least. His passes have been off-the-mark and a bit wild. His receivers not being on the same page don't help either, but that's something that should have been rectified during practice.

Ezekiel Elliott is injured. Lovely. There goes my over bet on him.

Inopportune penalties combined with poor tackling - the Cowboys weren't motivated to play hard this week, not against a Raiders team ranked as one-score underdogs.

## Bills @ Saints

Bills committing so much more to the running game now. First 12 plays, 8 of them have been rushes.
