## Raiders @ Cowboys

Anthony Brown with two critical pass interference penalties on 3rd down on a single drive, leading to a Raiders touchdown. Aggressive man coverage giveth and aggressive man coverage taketh.

Dak is not having a good game. Not in the least. His passes have been off-the-mark and a bit wild. His receivers not being on the same page don't help either, but that's something that should have been rectified during practice.

Ezekiel Elliott is injured. Lovely. There goes my over bet on him.

Inopportune penalties combined with poor tackling - the Cowboys weren't motivated to play hard this week, not against a Raiders team ranked as one-score underdogs.

## Bills @ Saints

Bills committing so much more to the running game now. First 12 plays, 8 of them have been rushes.

That being said, Allen is still off his game, forcing interceptions.

***

## Eagles @ Giants

Daniel Jones doesn't react well when his first or second read isn't there yet.

This Freddie Kitchens offense has an element of predictability to it. Not to mention it's not very creative or inspirational in design. No hurry-up here too. Giants are playing not to lose. Pathetic.

Giants do not have a good run defense at all. Stacking the line with five bodies isn't working - Jalen Hurts still managed to get free. Where's the discipline? Where's the coordination between the defensive line and the linebackers? Where's the speed?

New York's offensive line is still a travesty. No one player really can be considered a strength along that line, not in its current form.

## Buccaneers @ Colts

It's clear looking at statistics alone that the Buccaneers passing offense struggles hard against two-deep coverage.

## Titans @ Patriots

I need to watch the game, but it seems being overwhelming public favorites and witnessing this Titans team being plagued by injury didn't do much to stem their commitment to this game. Kudos to New England for winning this game in top fashion, though it did take an entire half for the Patriots to really kick into gear and blow Tennessee out. New England is playing hot. Clearly, their level of effort can't be brought into question - whether it's a function of their coaching or their overall morale, the Patriots are playing in good form.

Excellent recognition of a blitz by Mac Jones, immediately throwing the ball to Kendrick Bourne running a crossing route away from his man defender. It was a tough catch, being a fade pass and all, but Bourne did well catching the ball.

Teams actively defending Tennessee with light boxes now that Derrick Henry is no longer a presence on the offense for the foreseeable future. Interesting.

Jacob Hollister turning into a weapon of choice for Tannehill. As is NWI.

Mac Jones and his receivers are turning up against Tennessee in the first half. Big passes, maintaining composure, making defenders miss, and winning at the catch point.

## Rams @ Packers

Matthew Stafford is injured and it's obvious. Very worrying.

Packers making hay on their first drive with short plays.

Rashan Gary, Aaron Jones, and Allen Lazard are all playing. If I knew this for definite, Green Bay would have so been one of my picks this week!

On a fourth down and very short, Rams opt to run the ball with their tailback. Stafford is even worse than I thought.

Randall Cobb is turning up and getting hot.

Rams working six-man offensive lines against the Packers front while executing the hurry-up offense...it's actually working well. Wouldn't be surprised to see them run the same type of offense to open the second half.

As expected, the Rams tried to run the same type of offense, but it didn't pan out. A negative run on first-down kind of doomed things early.

This loss is on the Rams defense. The Packers opening drive was the death knell for Los Angeles - using AJ Dillon to jam the ball down the field and keep the Rams offense off the field for nearly 8 minutes was way too much for them. By the time Stafford and company actually retook the field, it lost some of its mojo.

Defensively, Green Bay improved tremendously in the second half. How so... I'm not sure. If I had to take a guess, it'd be that the Packers aren't dedicating so much energy in coverage to Odell anymore.

Never mind, seems like they're still committing a fair number of men to Beckham in coverage.

## Browns @ Ravens

Game is going about as expected. Nothing too shocking. Cleveland's offense is struggling. Ravens are starting slow, but gearing up.

Ravens running quite a bit laterally and Cleveland has done solid work bottling them up. It's only a matter of time before Baltimore experiences real success executing those plays.

Myles Garrett saving the Browns here by batting an imminent touchdown pass.

Lamar is getting his lunch eaten on throws over the middle. It's sad. Three interceptions before the first half even ended.

Cleveland's defensive linemen have done well winning their battles at the line of scrimmage. The pressure they're getting on Lamar is pretty commendable.

A jailbreak blitz has cut short a Raven drive. Hmm....Miami might have hit onto something here.

Cleveland's defense really impressed me. Well done. Baltimore didn't have too many explosive plays outside of two freak plays created by Lamar Jackson scrambling around while Mark Andrews runs improvised routes. The man coverage was tight, the runs never really burst open, and the edge rushers took Lamar out of his element on multiple plays. Jadaveon Clowney and Myles Garrett went out of their way to make this game personal. On top of that, the team managed to intercept Lamar on a number of different occasions. It's clear this defense is a step up from the unit last year - for one thing , it now has a pair of great pass rushers and some high-value draft picks manning the secondary.

## Vikings @ 49ers

Vikings with some flea flicker trickery leading them en route to a touchdown.

On a critical long third-down, the Vikings could not muster any pressure, despite rushing five. Granted, the 49ers were in max-protect, but it's not a good sign for a defense that prides itself on judicious blitzes.

Fantastic work by Garoppalo, nailing two big throws on a drive at the end of the first half to score the touchdown. One of those throws came on 3rd & 11, on a laser pass to Brandon Aiyuk streaking across the middle of the field surrounded by 3-4 Viking defenders.

Dalvin Cook is such a beast, chewing off an explosive run against an eight-man box.

Nice to see Klint Kubiak incorporating a bit more creativity into the offense. A play-action wide receiver screen tossed back to the tailback on the opposite side of the field helped Minnesota move the ball down a few yards away from the goal zone.

Kirk Cousins, on the other hand, hasn't been quite on point. He threw a bad interception to a linebacker after staring his receiver down. Then he failed to connect on a crucial two-point conversion play to Justin Jefferson.

On a red zone drive in the fourth quarter, the Vikings go with two boring rushes up the middle with Alexander Hamilton, a five-receiver set on 3rd down, and a hard bootleg on 4th down. Hmm....not the best set of play calls.

Elijah Mitchell and Deebo Samuel have been fantastic rushing the ball against one of the better defenses in the league.

## Seahawks @ Washington

Even though this has been stated before, it's worth mentioning again - Taylor Heinecke is one tough son of a bitch. His ability to handle pressure is matched by few.

Russell Wilson may be playing a little better. His deep passes have been on point.

Nope, never mind. Five drives, one first down for Seattle. Russell is done. At least as a Seahawk. Might be time to move him out to greener pastures elsewhere and begin a rebuild. Seattle's legendary Legion of Boom days are truly over.

Jack Del Rio gambling with some risky blitzes to try and close out the game as Russell Wilson tries to mount a comeback drive.
