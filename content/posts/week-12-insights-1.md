## Raiders @ Cowboys

Anthony Brown with two critical pass interference penalties on 3rd down on a single drive, leading to a Raiders touchdown. Aggressive man coverage giveth and aggressive man coverage taketh.

Dak is not having a good game. Not in the least. His passes have been off-the-mark and a bit wild. His receivers not being on the same page don't help either, but that's something that should have been rectified during practice.

Ezekiel Elliott is injured. Lovely. There goes my over bet on him.

Inopportune penalties combined with poor tackling - the Cowboys weren't motivated to play hard this week, not against a Raiders team ranked as one-score underdogs.

## Bills @ Saints

Bills committing so much more to the running game now. First 12 plays, 8 of them have been rushes.

That being said, Allen is still off his game, forcing interceptions.

***

## Eagles @ Giants

Daniel Jones doesn't react well when his first or second read isn't there yet.

This Freddie Kitchens offense has an element of predictability to it.

Giants do not have a good run defense at all. Stacking the line with five bodies isn't working - Jalen Hurts still managed to get free. Where's the discipline? Where's the coordination between the defensive line and the linebackers? Where's the speed?

New York's offensive line is still a travesty. No one player really can be considered a strength along that line, not in its current form.

## Buccaneers @ Colts

It's clear looking at statistics alone that the Buccaneers passing offense struggles hard against two-deep coverage.

## Titans @ Patriots

I need to watch the game, but it seems being overwhelming public favorites and witnessing this Titans team being plagued by injury didn't do much to stem their commitment to this game. Kudos to New England for winning this game in top fashion, though it did take an entire half for the Patriots to really kick into gear and blow Tennessee out. New England is playing hot. Clearly, their level of effort can't be brought into question - whether it's a function of their coaching or their overall morale, the Patriots are playing in good form.

## Rams @ Packers

Matthew Stafford is injured and it's obvious. Very worrying.

Packers making hay on their first drive with short plays. 

Rashan Gary, Aaron Jones, and Allen Lazard are all playing. If I knew this for definite, Green Bay would have so been one of my picks this week!

On a fourth down and very short, Rams opt to run the ball with their tailback. Stafford is even worse than I thought.

Randall Cobb is turning up and getting hot.
