## Raiders @ Cowboys

Anthony Brown with two critical pass interference penalties on 3rd down on a single drive, leading to a Raiders touchdown. Aggressive man coverage giveth and aggressive man coverage taketh.

Dak is not having a good game. Not in the least. His passes have been off-the-mark and a bit wild. His receivers not being on the same page don't help either, but that's something that should have been rectified during practice.
