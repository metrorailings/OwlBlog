## Giants @ Bengals

Daniel Jones playing genuinely better.

Giants trying their hardest to establish the ground game against these Bengals. 

Giants alternating between base 3-4 defense and a bland nickel package.

Now that Daniel Jones is out with what looks to be a bad leg cramp, Colt McCoy has been put into the game. The Giants are still running a basic offense involving power runs, lateral zone runs, and traditional dropback passing. Not good. We need more exotic plays being called here to make up for the fact that Colt McCoy is a bum.

Seems like Brandon Allen's best plays have come on bootlegs, though his accuracy and confidence is still pathetic. Consistent with the fact that his best plays with the Broncos last year came off bootlegs.

Is Zac Taylor finally calling more max protect formations here? Amazing.

The Giants have to get rid of Evan Engram, no question. His big play potential doesn't make up for all his mistakes and his (seemingly) poor run-blocking.

## Chargers @ Bills

Chargers going a little ham with the blitz on a drive. It cost them dearly on a third-and-long.
