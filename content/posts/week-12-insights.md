## Giants @ Bengals

Daniel Jones playing genuinely better.

Giants trying their hardest to establish the ground game against these Bengals. 

Giants alternating between base 3-4 defense and a bland nickel package.

Now that Daniel Jones is out with what looks to be a bad leg cramp, Colt McCoy has been put into the game. The Giants are still running a basic offense involving power runs, lateral zone runs, and traditional dropback passing. Not good. We need more exotic plays being called here to make up for the fact that Colt McCoy is a bum.

Seems like Brandon Allen's best plays have come on bootlegs, though his accuracy and confidence is still pathetic. Consistent with the fact that his best plays with the Broncos last year came off bootlegs.

Is Zac Taylor finally calling more max protect formations here? Amazing.

The Giants have to get rid of Evan Engram, no question. His big play potential doesn't make up for all his mistakes and his (seemingly) poor run-blocking.

Impressive that the Bengals have not committed many penalties today outside of a few offensive holds that actually ended some drives or negated some productive plays. In fact, I'm sort of impressed to see the Bengals still fighting for a win here, despite losing the heart and soul of their team and the schism between the locker room and the head coach. 

Meanwhile Cameron Fleming has three penalties against him alone. Wasn't Fleming a reject Jason Garrett brought along with him from Dallas.

## Chargers @ Bills

Chargers going a little ham with the blitz on a drive. It cost them dearly on a third-and-long.

## Chiefs @ Buccaneers

Brady has a love affair with Mike Evans.

Tampa Bay's passing game is a touch too slow. Brady making too many decisions after the snap, according to Tony Romo. More activity needs to take place before the snap so that Brady can see some things prior to the snap and react quicker.

Tampa Bay left a cornerback in single coverage against Tyreek Hill. Yikes.  Safeties are not playing assignments against these explosive Chiefs.

On an important series of downs following a Kansas City touchdown, Bruce Arians opts to run once and pass twice out of empty formation. No motion before the snap, no misdirection, and some of the receivers aren't even fully aware of the type of play they're running.
