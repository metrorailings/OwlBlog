## Giants @ Bengals

Daniel Jones playing genuinely better.

Giants trying their hardest to establish the ground game against these Bengals.

Giants alternating between base 3-4 defense and a bland nickel package.

Now that Daniel Jones is out with what looks to be a bad leg cramp, Colt McCoy has been put into the game. The Giants are still running a basic offense involving power runs, lateral zone runs, and traditional dropback passing. Not good. We need more exotic plays being called here to make up for the fact that Colt McCoy is a bum.

Seems like Brandon Allen's best plays have come on bootlegs, though his accuracy and confidence is still pathetic. Consistent with the fact that his best plays with the Broncos last year came off bootlegs.

Is Zac Taylor finally calling more max protect formations here? Amazing.

The Giants have to get rid of Evan Engram, no question. His big play potential doesn't make up for all his mistakes and his (seemingly) poor run-blocking.

Impressive that the Bengals have not committed many penalties today outside of a few offensive holds that actually ended some drives or negated some productive plays. In fact, I'm sort of impressed to see the Bengals still fighting for a win here, despite losing the heart and soul of their team and the schism between the locker room and the head coach.

Meanwhile Cameron Fleming has three penalties against him alone. Wasn't Fleming a reject Jason Garrett brought along with him from Dallas.

## Chargers @ Bills

Chargers going a little ham with the blitz on a drive. It cost them dearly on a third-and-long.

***

## Bears @ Packers

Without Akiem Hicks, Chicago's run defense really suffers. The Packers are effectively rushing the ball a bunch of different ways.

Rodgers with some great improvisation on a misdirection play that was breaking down.

Mitch Trubisky failing as expected.

Green Bay understands Chicago's playbook as well as Chicago does.

## Chiefs @ Buccaneers

Brady has a love affair with Mike Evans.

Tampa Bay's passing game is a touch too slow. Brady making too many decisions after the snap, according to Tony Romo. More activity needs to take place before the snap so that Brady can see some things prior to the snap and react quicker.

Tampa Bay left a cornerback in single coverage against Tyreek Hill. Yikes.  Safeties are not playing assignments against these explosive Chiefs.

On an important series of downs following a Kansas City touchdown, Bruce Arians opts to run once and pass twice out of empty formation. No motion before the snap, no misdirection, and some of the receivers aren't even fully aware of the type of play they're running.

Only 12 rushes by Tampa Bay halfway through the 4th quarter. Their success today was predicated on whether they'd choose to run the ball more. Clearly...Bruce Arians felt different. Will Arians finally learn his lesson here and opt to run the ball more often now? Probably not.

**Rewatching the game...all comments below this are from the rewatch.**

So far, multiple defensive linemen have stood out on Tampa Bay's side, notably Jason Pierre-Paul and Shaq Barrett. Donkey Kong Suh also made his ugly mug known on a couple run plays.

Rob Gronkowski was key on the first promising drive that the Buccaneers were actually able to engineer. Starting to rethink his role on this offense...

Spags and his blitzes are absolutely frustrating Brady. Two of those blitzes literally led to Brady throwing picks.

In the second half, Jason Pierre-Paul is standing out more than before. William Gholston is also showing up more, especially on stunts.

## 49ers @ Rams

Richard Sherman already making a difference in the running game, let alone the passing game.

The 49ers offense must live and die by its ground game. Nick Mullens isn't a quarterback built for dropbacks. Negative game scripts has killed 49er drives twice, precisely because Mullins cannot operate in obvious passing situations.

Goff once again wilts under pressure, choking up a fumble on a critical drive to end the first half.

The left guard of the Rams offensive line lost two battles successively in the trenches. The second time was particular devastating, as pressure on Jared Goff led to a pick six.

The 49ers defensive front are constantly winning battles at the line of scrimmage. It's been the difference maker in this game. Not only is Goff getting rattled, but the Rams ground game has been neutered all game. Simply put, the Rams offense isn't productive at all.

Deebo Samuel is a gamer.

Up-tempo offense forces the 49ers to play base defense, it seems.

The right tackle of the 49ers has given up some big plays, including a tackle that led to a fumble-six.

The 49ers likely messed up on a blitz, leaving a huge lane Cam Akers was able to exploit for a huge gain. Either that or they were so convinced that Los Angeles would be passing the ball that gap integrity was the least of their concerns on that play.

## Chargers @ Bills

Brilliant red zone play for a touchdown by the Bills.

The Bills defense seems to work off assuming whether a plan will be a run or a pass. Also, this defense seems to have a pronounced weakness against the running game.

Some clever plays from the Chargers on their first touchdown drive, a few of which exploited the formations Buffalo presented.

Bills offensive line letting up some major pressure on a series of downs that ended in a punt.

Josh Allen doing well getting rid of the ball quick and thinking on his feet. I'm genuinely impressed.

Buffalo gave up a huge run on a gamble blitz. Other than that, the Bills have been fairly stout against the Chargers ground game.

The Chargers offensive line have been pretty bad. No speed, no strength.

Los Angeles and their offensive playbook leaves me uninspired.
