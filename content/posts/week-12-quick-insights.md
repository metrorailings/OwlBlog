## Giants @ Bears

Trubisky plays much better in a high-tempo offense.

## Cowboys @ Patriots

The Patriots will need to commit more to running the ball, as their passing game is still a mess when throws are not schemed

Cowboys have seen some success running the ball. Nothing too consistent, but it seems like something that'll help them string a few plays together on a scoring drive.

These Cowgirls aren't equipped to play in wet and windy conditions. Their special teams also may present a serious liability.

Patriots pass protection has held up remarkably well now that Isaiah Wynn has been inserted back into the lineup.

A promising New England drive was finally stopped when Demarcus Lawrence and Michael Bennett finally stepped up and killed two run plays.
