## Giants @ Bears

Trubisky plays much better in a high-tempo offense.

## Cowboys @ Patriots

The Patriots will need to commit more to running the ball, as their passing game is still a mess when throws are not schemed

Cowboys have seen some success running the ball. Nothing too consistent, but it seems like something that'll help them string a few plays together on a scoring drive.

These Cowgirls aren't equipped to play in wet and windy conditions. Their special teams also may present a serious liability.

Patriots pass protection has held up remarkably well now that Isaiah Wynn has been inserted back into the lineup.

A promising New England drive was finally stopped when Demarcus Lawrence and Michael Bennett finally stepped up and killed two run plays.

The Cowboys may have the worst special teams in the league. New England is exposing this unit as a joke.

Kyle Van Noy may be the Patriots' best pass rusher. I'm waiting to see Jamie Collins really make his presence felt. But it's interesting that New England's best pass rushers are not necessarily people that specialize in trench warfare to begin with. Instead, New England seems more inclined to converting linebackers into down linemen hybrids. It's probably the reason why the team decided to jettison Michael Bennett earlier in the season.

## Dolphins @ Browns

A gift of a pass interference call sustained a Browns touchdown drive.

## Packers @ 49ers

The 49ers have a pretty dominant defensive line, if that hasn't been emphasized enough before. Arik Armstead now wreaking havoc in the backfield when he lines up as an edge rusher.

The Packers lack diversity and creativity in their offensive playbook. Unlike Arizona last week, the Packers are not taking advantage of the 49ers' tendency on defense to keep their cornerbacks off the receivers. Green Bay's offense should be dinking and dunking their way to points here. Instead, Rodgers is insisting on holding the ball here instead of simply taking what the defense is giving him.

Slants and digs are ripping apart this Green Bay coverage unit. 

Cris Collinsworth is a goddamn moron sometimes.

Fred Warner stepping up nicely as the middle linebacker now that Kwon Alexander is out for the season.
