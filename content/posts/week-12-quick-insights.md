## Giants @ Bears

Trubisky plays much better in a high-tempo offense.

## Cowboys @ Patriots

The Patriots will need to commit more to running the ball, as their passing game is still a mess when throws are not schemed

Cowboys have seen some success running the ball. Nothing too consistent, but it seems like something that'll help them string a few plays together on a scoring drive.

These Cowgirls aren't equipped to play in wet and windy conditions. Their special teams also may present a serious liability.

Patriots pass protection has held up remarkably well now that Isaiah Wynn has been inserted back into the lineup.

A promising New England drive was finally stopped when Demarcus Lawrence and Michael Bennett finally stepped up and killed two run plays.

The Cowboys may have the worst special teams in the league. New England is exposing this unit as a joke.

Kyle Van Noy may be the Patriots' best pass rusher. I'm waiting to see Jamie Collins really make his presence felt. But it's interesting that New England's best pass rushers are not necessarily people that specialize in trench warfare to begin with. Instead, New England seems more inclined to converting linebackers into down linemen hybrids. It's probably the reason why the team decided to jettison Michael Bennett earlier in the season.
