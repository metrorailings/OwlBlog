### Raiders @ Falcons (+3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Chiefs** (35) @ Raiders (31)  
Falcons (9) @ **Saints** (24)

#### _Record_

Raiders (6-4)  
Falcons (3-7)

#### _Injuries_

Raiders are mostly healthy. Clelin Ferrell's return should boost a pass rush that ranks as one of the worst in the league, though Rod Marinelli has made some remarkable strides with the unit over the past couple weeks.

The injury bug has been ripping through the Falcons offensive weaponry as of late. Julio Jones is legitimately questionable to play, as are Hayden Hurst. Todd Gurley has been blissfully ruled out though, so tailback duties will likely be split by his more promising back-ups.

### Giants @ Bengals (+6)

***

#### _Latest Results_

BYE - Eagles (17) @ **Giants** (27)  
Bengals (9) @ **Washington** (20)

#### _Record_

Giants (3-7)  
Bengals (2-7-1)

#### _Injuries_

Giants are mostly healthy off the bye, though starter Devonta Freeman has been lost to IR for the season.

Bengals will be forced to start Brandon Allen now that Joe Burrow is done this season (and likely next season too). Giovani Bernard has been activated, but what good is a stud tailback if the head coach refuses to run the ball much? Then again, Brandon Allen being the quarterback may force Zac Taylor into calling more rushing plays.

#### _Weather_

Cloudy and a bit wet, but otherwise good weather.

***

### Chargers @ Bills (-5.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Jets (28) @ **Chargers** (34)  
BYE - Bills (30) @ **Cardinals** (32)

#### _Record_

Chargers (3-7)  
Bills (7-3)

#### _Injuries_

The Chargers will be without their starting cornerback in Casey Heyward and arguably their second best defensive lineman in Melvin Ingram. The good news is that Nick Bosa will be starting for the second game in a row here, a boon for a defense lack pass rushing prowess.

Buffalo will not have John Brown on the field for at least the next three weeks. Brown is critical as he and Diggs do well together opening up that deep ball.

#### _Weather_

Cool with a bit of wind.

***

### Chiefs @ Buccaneers (+3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Chiefs** (35) @ Buccaneers (31)  
**Rams** (27) @ Buccaneers (24)

#### _Record_

Chiefs (9-1)  
Buccaneers (7-4)

#### _Injuries_

Tampa's offensive line is in shambles. Not only is center A.Q. Shipley gone permanently, guard Ali Marpet and tackle Donovan Smith will likely be out as well. The Buccaneers will be testing the full depth of the offensive line against a Kansas defensive front headlined by Chris Jones. 

Chiefs are almost entirely healthy, though right tackle Mitchell Schwartz being on IR doesn't help an offensive line missing some depth. 

#### _Weather_

True summer weather.

***

### Seahawks @ Eagles (+4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Cardinals (21) @ **Seahawks** (28)  
Eagles (17) @ **Browns** (22)

#### _Record_

Seahawks (7-3)  
Eagles (3-6-1)

#### _Injuries_

The Eagles offensive line will once again be shuffled around now that Lane Johnson is out for the season and Jason Peters may not be suiting up for the game. Even worse, the offensive line is missing some depth as well with Sua Opeta being ruled out.

Seattle will be missing their starting right tackle, so the offensive line injuries stretch across both teams here.

#### _Weather_

Cool weather with some drizzle.
