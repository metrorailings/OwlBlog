### Chiefs @ Buccaneers (+3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Chiefs** (35) @ Buccaneers (31)  
**Rams** (27) @ Buccaneers (24)

#### _Record_

Chiefs (9-1)  
Buccaneers (7-4)

#### _Injuries_

Tampa's offensive line is in shambles. Not only is center A.Q. Shipley gone permanently, guard Ali Marpet and tackle Donovan Smith will likely be out as well. The Buccaneers will be testing the full depth of the offensive line against a Kansas defensive front headlined by Chris Jones. 

Chiefs are almost entirely healthy, though right tackle Mitchell Schwartz being on IR doesn't help an offensive line missing some depth. 

#### _Weather_

True summer weather.

***

### Seahawks @ Eagles (+4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Cardinals (21) @ **Seahawks** (28)  
Eagles (17) @ **Browns** (22)

#### _Record_

Seahawks (7-3)  
Eagles (3-6-1)

#### _Injuries_

The Eagles offensive line will once again be shuffled around now that Lane Johnson is out for the season and Jason Peters may not be suiting up for the game. Even worse, the offensive line is missing some depth as well with Sua Opeta being ruled out.

Seattle will be missing their starting right tackle, so the offensive line injuries stretch across both teams here.

#### _Weather_

Cool weather with some drizzle.
