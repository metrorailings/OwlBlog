Last week was a much better outing. A return to form, almost. The only two picks that really soured on me were Miami and New England last week. It was a tough lesson I had to learn - never bet on flawed road favorites going up against home underdogs there were just embarrassed the week prior.

As I noted in last week's analysis, Houston and Denver could win their matches so long as the former could throw the ball against a slow Patriots defense and the latter could run the ball all over a soft Miami front. That was _exactly_ what happened. Deshaun Watson stunted all over the Patriots defense, racking up 239 yards in the first half on 26 passes, only 5 of which went incomplete. Denver went ham all over Miami's defensive front, with Philip Lindsay and Melvin Gordon averaging more than 5 rushing yards on 31 carries.

Road favorites with clear weaknesses provide good betting value here, and that'll be the main theme this week given that I'm going with 3 road underdogs. Let's get on to the picks.

### Raiders @ Falcons (+3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Chiefs** (35) @ Raiders (31)  
Falcons (9) @ **Saints** (24)

#### _Record_

Raiders (6-4)  
Falcons (3-7)

#### _Injuries_

Raiders are mostly healthy. Clelin Ferrell's return should boost a pass rush that ranks as one of the worst in the league, though Rod Marinelli has made some remarkable strides with the unit over the past couple weeks.

The injury bug has been ripping through the Falcons offensive weaponry as of late. Julio Jones is legitimately questionable to play, as are Hayden Hurst. Todd Gurley has been blissfully ruled out though, so tailback duties will likely be split by his more promising back-ups.

### Giants @ Bengals (+6)

***

#### _Latest Results_

BYE - Eagles (17) @ **Giants** (27)  
Bengals (9) @ **Washington** (20)

#### _Record_

Giants (3-7)  
Bengals (2-7-1)

#### _Injuries_

Giants are mostly healthy off the bye, though starter Devonta Freeman has been lost to IR for the season.

Bengals will be forced to start Brandon Allen now that Joe Burrow is done this season (and likely next season too). Giovani Bernard has been activated, but what good is a stud tailback if the head coach adamantly refuses to run the ball much? Then again, Brandon Allen being the quarterback will probably force him to call more rushing plays to compensate for the fact that his quarterback is absolute ass at the game of football.

#### History / Analysis

Cincinnati and New York are two very hard teams to compare here, especially given that the Bengals offense will look dramatically different without Joe Burrow.

Still, matches between motivated teams and demoralized franchises usually  go well for the motivated team, no?

#### _Weather_

Cloudy and a bit wet, but otherwise good weather.

***

Giants -6

***

**New York covers if**  
Brandon Allen and Giovani Bernard fail to give any spark to a demoralized offense.  
\- OR -  
the Giants ground game explodes against a Bengals defensive front letting up nearly 5 yards a carry.

**Cincinnati covers if**  
Brandon Allen and Giovani Bernard somehow stumble into a few touchdowns.  
\- OR -  
Most of the Giants show up hungover to the game. Hard to see happening, given that Joe Judge has these Giants buying into his message wholesale.

### Chargers @ Bills (-5.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Jets (28) @ **Chargers** (34)  
BYE - Bills (30) @ **Cardinals** (32)

#### _Record_

Chargers (3-7)  
Bills (7-3)

#### _Injuries_

The Chargers will be without their starting cornerback in Casey Heyward and arguably their second best defensive lineman in Melvin Ingram. The good news is that Nick Bosa will be starting for the second game in a row here, a boon for a defense lack pass rushing prowess.

Buffalo will not have John Brown on the field for at least the next three weeks. Brown is critical as he and Diggs do well together opening up that deep ball.

#### _History_

Buffalo has gone up against two really impressive quarterbacks the two weeks before their bye. Both times, Buffalo managed to impress me, especially in their game versus Kyler Murray and the Cardinals - despite being undermanned in the secondary, the Bills kept Arizona's air game in check through four quarters. 

Los Angeles is yet another team defined by a top-flight quarterback and not much else. So recent history bodes well for Buffalo here.

#### _Weather_

Cool with a bit of wind.

***

Bills -5.5

***

**Buffalo covers if**  
their secondary and defensive front really limits Justin Herbert's explosive plays. Josh Allen also needs to continue playing at a high level, even without John Brown. All this is certainly possible if Buffalo wishes to make a statement to make up for their heartbreaking defeat in Arizona two weeks ago.

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Justin Herbert manages to play well enough against Buffalo's exotic man coverage formations  
\- OR -  
the Bills play soft defense after going up by multiple scores, allowing the Chargers to slide into a back-door cover.

***

### Chiefs @ Buccaneers (+3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Chiefs** (35) @ Buccaneers (31)  
**Rams** (27) @ Buccaneers (24)

#### _Record_

Chiefs (9-1)  
Buccaneers (7-4)

#### _Injuries_

Tampa's offensive line is in shambles. Not only is center A.Q. Shipley gone permanently, guard Ali Marpet and tackle Donovan Smith will likely be out as well. The Buccaneers will be testing the full depth of the offensive line against a Kansas defensive front headlined by Chris Jones.

Chiefs are almost entirely healthy, though right tackle Mitchell Schwartz being on IR doesn't help an offensive line missing some depth. Still, the return of Sammy Watkins is so very badly needed - that Robinson kid isn't cutting it as the third option at receiver.

#### _Weather_

True summer weather.

***

### Seahawks @ Eagles (+4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Cardinals (21) @ **Seahawks** (28)  
Eagles (17) @ **Browns** (22)

#### _Record_

Seahawks (7-3)  
Eagles (3-6-1)

#### _Injuries_

The Eagles offensive line will once again be shuffled around now that Lane Johnson is out for the season and Jason Peters may not be suiting up for the game. Even worse, the offensive line is missing some depth as well with Sua Opeta being ruled out.

Seattle will be missing their starting right tackle, so the offensive line injuries stretch across both teams here.

#### _Weather_

Cool weather with some drizzle.
