Better selections this week. I went 4-1. New York, Washington, Tampa Bay, and Baltimore paid off beautifully. Tennessee might have paid off too if a few more of their star players were healthy and active. That being said, there's always room for improvement. Miami was on my forecast last week, but I shied away from them as I didn't trust Tua enough to carry the offense against Carolina's beastly pass rushers. It didn't seem to matter much though, as the Dolphins struck gold through an offensive strategy predicated on having their quarterback air the ball out as quickly as possible after the snap. With their pass rush neutered and their secondary absolutely feckless against short passes, Carolina was all but doomed. I should have shown more faith in my Miami hunch.

Likewise, Green Bay was another pick I let slide from my grasp. It was clear the Rams lost a step, but I couldn't pull the gun on the Packers as too many people I trusted vocally supported the Rams under the assumption that Los Angeles was due for an upward transformation given their desperate circumstances.

On top of that, I need to make more of an effort to explore games I wouldn't normally analyze. The Chargers/Broncos game last week comes to mind here - in hindsight, it was easy to see Denver's defense singlehandedly dominating this game, but I was scared off after witnessing Teddy Bridgewater giving up just the week before.

So let the good work here continue.

Despite the bye, Kyler Murray and DeAndre Hopkins still remain question marks regarding their game-time status.

As for Chicago, it's worth keeping an eye on Roquan Smith and Akiem Hicks.  Both are cornerstone pieces of the defensive front seven - missing both would be a severe blow to an otherwise high-level defense.
