Better selections this week. I went 4-1. New York, Washington, Tampa Bay, and Baltimore paid off beautifully. Tennessee might have paid off too if a few more of their star players were healthy and active. That being said, there's always room for improvement. Miami was on my forecast last week, but I shied away from them as I didn't trust Tua enough to carry the offense against Carolina's beastly pass rushers. It didn't seem to matter much though, as the Dolphins struck gold through an offensive strategy predicated on having their quarterback air the ball out as quickly as possible after the snap. With their pass rush neutered and their secondary absolutely feckless against short passes, Carolina was all but doomed. I should have shown more faith in my Miami hunch.

Likewise, Green Bay was another pick I let slide from my grasp. It was clear the Rams lost a step, but I couldn't pull the gun on the Packers as too many people I trusted vocally supported the Rams under the assumption that Los Angeles was due for an upward transformation given their desperate circumstances.

On top of that, I need to make more of an effort to explore games I wouldn't normally analyze. The Chargers/Broncos game last week comes to mind here - in hindsight, it was easy to see Denver's defense singlehandedly dominating this game, but I was scared off after witnessing Teddy Bridgewater giving up just the week before.

So let the good work here continue.

### Cardinals @ Bears (+7.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**_Cardinals_** @ Seahawks \[BYE\]  
**Bears** @ _Lions_ (Thanksgiving)

#### _Key Injuries_

Despite the bye, Kyler Murray and DeAndre Hopkins still remain question marks regarding their game-time status.

As for Chicago, it's worth keeping an eye on Roquan Smith and Akiem Hicks.  Both are cornerstone pieces of the defensive front seven - missing both would be a severe blow to an otherwise high-level defense.

Honestly though, the most important injury to watch here is Justin Fields. It's not so much his raw passing talent that matters as it is his ability to scramble and execute designed quarterback runs. Arizona's worst games this season usually came against teams that can run the ball. More on that in the next section...

#### _History_

Arizona ranks among the worst when it comes to rushing defense. Chicago's specialty (at least when Justin Fields is at the helm of the offense) is rushing the ball. But the problem here is that it seems more probable to me that Andy Dalton will start again for the Bears. For one thing, Justin Fields is dealing with cracked ribs, and ribs take time to heal properly. Two, I have a feeling Matt Nagy has taken a shine to Andy Dalton, if only because Dalton's better at running the type of passing plays Nagy loves to invoke. On top of that, Dalton's on a winning streak, as meager a reason as that may be.

Hmmm...besides that, Arizona has been on a hot streak over the course of the season, far surpassing its expectations and winning games they would have lost last year. It's tempting to think the Cardinals are nowhere near as spectacular as their record may suggest, but the team has shown some serious swagger lately. Unlike Chicago, Arizona can will its way to victory to domination even when things aren't initially in their favor.

#### _Weather_

Heavy rains are looking more and more likely as the days pass

Undecided

**Arizona covers if**  
the team shows up fully prepared coming off the bye, something that's never happened before under Kliff Kingsbury  
\- AND -  
Matt Nagy insists on Andy Dalton passing the ball.

**Chicago covers if**  
their run/pass ratio favors the ground game. Chicago needs to wholeheartedly commit to running the ball against an Arizona defense vulnerable against opposing rushers. The weather being particularly nasty this Sunday should help them in that regard.

### 49ers @ Seahawks (+3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Vikings @ **_49ers_**  
Seahawks @ **_Washington_** (MNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

Deebo Samuel is likely out after suffering a groin injury against Minnesota. Without Deebo, the 49ers leave their most dynamic and versatile player on offense. It'll hurt, to put it simply. Fred Warner will likely spend a week on the mend. And his absence will hurt too - outside of Nick Bosa, Warner's the most important player on defense.

Seattle desperately needs Damien Lewis and Jamarco James back, the former to anchor the interior of the line and the latter as valuable back-up. Hopefully both return in time for this game.

#### _History_

The first time these two danced, Seattle dominated thanks mostly to Trey Lance being forced to man the reins of the offense after injuries forced Garoppalo out of the game.  It was clear Lance was in no way prepared for the magnitude of the moment, and Seattle made sure to capitalize on the rookie's complete inexperience.

It's way too tempting to think that things will go differently this time around.  San Francisco has found rhythm on offense, especially now that Jimmy Garoppalo is (arguably) playing some of the best football of his career. Meanwhile, Russell Wilson is sinking to new lows in his career, having had nothing but flaccid performances the past three weeks after returning from finger surgery. Furthermore, Seattle's home field advantage is no longer what it used to be. And while the Seahawk defense has sharpened over the past several weeks, it can't be considered elite in any capacity whatsoever.

So why can't San Francisco notch a road win here? Three words - level of effort. San Francisco has just about every reason to sleepwalk through this game. Not only did it impress last week in a statement win against a resurgent Vikings team, but Seattle looked downright _pathetic_ in its loss against Washington the day after - a juggs machine would have racked up better stats than Russell Wilson last night. People are now claiming Russ is cooked. And in all truth, he probably is, give he's been on a downward trajectory since the bye last year. It was only the last couple weeks people finally noticed Russell lost so much of his moxie, so it shouldn't be much surprise to see the public fawning all over the 49ers this week.

But all this plays to Seattle's advantage, should San Francisco walk out on to the field playing decently below their potential. Not to mention these Seahawks still play with some feistiness, especially on defense. And the offense can produce occasionally despite missing a few pistons. It's possible the Hawks can surprise some folks here, especially a 49er team expecting an easy win. Some help is needed, but the opportunity is there to steal one from a heavy public favorite.

#### _Weather_

Not too cold, but humidity may be a factor here

***

Seahawks +3

***

**Seattle covers if**  
they can come out strong against a 49er team expecting an easy win against a pushover. The Seahawks need to establish the early lead and force the 49ers to play from behind for a good bit of the game.

**San Francisco covers if**  
Shanahan and Garoppalo find ways to keep this offense consistently productive against a spirited Seattle defense. It won't be easy especially considering Deebo Samuel will likely be ruled out for the game  
\- AND -  
Russell Wilson has truly lost the drive to fight for his team and win. After that  failing effort last week against Washington, I'd imagine Russell Wilson would convene with Shane Waldron and his supporting cast and work on fixing this offense. Then again, if the rumor of his falling out with Pete Carroll are true...

### Giants @ Dolphins (-5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Eagles @ **_Giants  
_**Panthers @ **_Dolphins_**

#### _Key Injuries_

Daniel Jones is at risk of not playing this Sunday due to a neck strain. Without Jones, Mike Glennon tragically will be asked to start. On top of that, Sterling Shepard and Kadarius Toney are still suffering through some lingering injuries, so it's worth watching their status come Friday. The practice report on Wednesday indicated the Giants only conducted a walkthrough practice. It worries me to see New York be so leisurely coming off an uninspiring win.

For Miami, Adam Shaheen is on track to return after practicing on a limited basis Wednesday. Other than that, nothing else is seriously worrying me. Even though the starting cornerbacks are limited, both are likely to play.

#### _History_

No recent history between these two, but Joe Judge and Brian Flores know one another from their New England days - the former being the special teams coordinator while the latter was effectively in charge of the defense. Even still, it won't exactly be Judge who Flores will be planning against this week - it'll be Freddie Kitchens, who frankly bored the hell out of me with his uninspiring play calls last Sunday. Other than more shotgun draws, I'm not sure Kitchens actively added any more wrinkles into the offense. Maybe Judge is right and Kitchens needs more time to adjust the offense to something more imaginative and more tailored to the offensive players on the roster, but I'll believe that when I start seeing some progress.

Miami's offense is predicated on quick throws to skill players running flat routes. Can the Giants defense adjust accordingly and play more man coverage to disrupt the Dolphins before they run their routes? Not too sure. In my opinion, Patrick Graham didn't do nearly enough to stem Philadelphia's rushing game last Sunday - the Eagles still managed to chew off over 200 rushing yards against New York. It was only because the Eagles insisted on Jalen Hurts passing way too much for his own good that the Giants were able to hold long enough to win the game.

#### _Weather_

Slight chance of rain on an otherwise gorgeous Miami day

***

Dolphins -5

***

**Miami covers if**  
Sterling Shepard and Kadarius Toney are still unable to play at full strength come gametime  
\- AND -  
Freddie Kitchens once again fails to renovate this offense, making things much easier for a Miami defense that's been steadily improving over the past several weeks.

**New York covers if**  
their main skill players on offense return in top form  
\- AND -  
Freddie Kitchens can actually infuse life back into this offense by introducing new concepts that were never incorporated back when Garrett was still in charge on that side of the ball.

### Chargers @ Bengals (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Chargers @ **_Broncos_**  
Steelers @ **_Bengals_**

#### _Key Injuries_

Chargers look fairly healthy, though the Thursday and Friday practices will tell us all we need to know.

Cincinnati's offensive line is a bit banged up from last week's contest against Pittsburgh, but all linemen are expected to be active next Sunday. Still, it's worth keeping an eye on their injury report come Friday.

#### _History_

Last year, the Tyrod Taylor-led Chargers barely won against Joe Burrow and his team in their first-ever start. Obviously, things have changed considerably since then. The Chargers now have a truly talented quarterback at the helm of their offense while the Bengals have seriously upgraded their roster in the offseason. On top of that, Los Angeles is coming into the game with a completely different coaching regime, one more oriented towards heavy pass coverage and quick passes.

That being said, the Bengals are one of the better teams at rushing the ball, which doesn't bode well in the least for Los Angeles and their league-worst rushing defense. Even more worryingly, Cincinnati's boasts a quality defense as well. It's not considered elite in any one respect, but it's solid across the board.

What initially concerned me about Cincinnati's defense was what I initially thought was a tendency to surrender passes underneath in the flat, like in the Jets game. But last week, it was noticeable that the Bengals were playing Pittsburgh's receivers fairly tight, even cutting some quick routes right as they developed. Only once did I see the Bengals give the Steeler skill players space in the flat.

#### _Weather_

Quite a bit of rain is expected on an otherwise pleasant day

***

Bengals -3

***

**Cincinnati covers if**  
their defense can prevent the Chargers from playing efficiently on offense. Just like last week against the Steelers, the Bengal defenders need to maintain tight coverage against the Charger skill players and make sure Austin Ekeler isn't given the oxygen necessary to pop off big runs. Los Angeles will have their receivers run all sorts of quick routes to give Justin Herbert quick outlets in the passing game, but Cincinnati can deter them from doing so by allocating more manpower to the flat and intermediate areas.

**Los Angeles covers if**  
their offense finally discovers new life by leveraging new concepts that weren't previously incorporated in the existing playbook  
\- AND -  
their defense can force turnovers from a quarterback prone to reckless plays every now and then.

## Eagles @ Jets (+7)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Eagles @ **_Giants_**  
**_Jets_** @ Texans

#### _Key Injuries_

Jack Driscoll landed on injured reserve after his ankle gave out during the game against the Giants. With that loss, their offensive line will be really tested given Driscoll was already filling in for a starting guard in the first place. Besides that, Jalen Hurts also showed up on the injury report with a tweaked ankle, but he's expected to strive on forward.

For the Jets, Mike White and Keelan Cole are currently sidelined with COVID designations. Corey Davis is still working through a groin issue that kept him out last week.

#### _History_

Neither of these two have danced recently given both belong to different conferences. That being said, the Jets defense has been historically inept. Their rushing defense is particular has been utterly pathetic. Unfortunately for them, Philadelphia is one of the best rushing outfits in the league. It's been their ability to matriculate the rock over ground that's scored them quite a few wins this year.

#### _Weather_

Unseasonably warm for an early December game at Metlife

***

Eagles -7

***

**Philadelphia covers if**  
their offensive coaches remain committed to rushing the ball behind Jalen Hurts and Miles Sanders. Their downfall last week was their bull-headed insistence on having Hurts pass the ball on critical downs. That can't be the case this week.

**New York covers if**  
Zach Wilson manages to negotiate around Philadelphia's aggressive pass rush and keep the chains moving consistently, dominating time of possession in the process.

### Washington @ Raiders (-2.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Seahawks @ **_Washington_** (MNF)  
**_Raiders_** @ Cowboys (Thanksgiving)

#### _Key Injuries_

Washington will lose Joey Slye for the season, forcing them to sign somebody off the street to kick field goals for them. Not good. Additionally, J.D. McKissic will likely be sidelined with a concussion.

Very likely Darren Waller could be out this Sunday, leaving the Raiders without one of their best weapons on offense. Josh Jacobs is working through injuries as well. But some good news - Trayvon Mullen will likely make his return from injured reserve, giving the Raiders some more reinforcement back there in the secondary.
