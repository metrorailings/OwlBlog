Better selections this week. I went 4-1. New York, Washington, Tampa Bay, and Baltimore paid off beautifully. Tennessee might have paid off too if a few more of their star players were healthy and active. That being said, there's always room for improvement. Miami was on my forecast last week, but I shied away from them as I didn't trust Tua enough to carry the offense against Carolina's beastly pass rushers. It didn't seem to matter much though, as the Dolphins struck gold through an offensive strategy predicated on having their quarterback air the ball out as quickly as possible after the snap. With their pass rush neutered and their secondary absolutely feckless against short passes, Carolina was all but doomed. I should have shown more faith in my Miami hunch.

Likewise, Green Bay was another pick I let slide from my grasp. It was clear the Rams lost a step, but I couldn't pull the gun on the Packers as too many people I trusted vocally supported the Rams under the assumption that Los Angeles was due for an upward transformation given their desperate circumstances.

On top of that, I need to make more of an effort to explore games I wouldn't normally analyze. The Chargers/Broncos game last week comes to mind here - in hindsight, it was easy to see Denver's defense singlehandedly dominating this game, but I was scared off after witnessing Teddy Bridgewater giving up just the week before.

So let the good work here continue.

**_Cardinals_** @ Seahawks \[BYE\]  
**Bears** @ _Lions_ (Thanksgiving)

#### _Key Injuries_

Despite the bye, Kyler Murray and DeAndre Hopkins still remain question marks regarding their game-time status.

As for Chicago, it's worth keeping an eye on Roquan Smith and Akiem Hicks.  Both are cornerstone pieces of the defensive front seven - missing both would be a severe blow to an otherwise high-level defense.

### 49ers @ Seahawks (+3.5)

Vikings @ **_49ers_**  
Seahawks @ **_Washington_** (MNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

Deebo Samuel is likely out after suffering a groin injury against Minnesota. Without Deebo, the 49ers leave their most dynamic and versatile player on offense. It'll hurt, to put it simply. Fred Warner will likely spend a week on the mend. And his absence will hurt too - outside of Nick Bosa, Warner's the most important player on defense.

Seattle desperately needs Damien Lewis and Jamarco James back, the former to anchor the interior of the line and the latter as valuable back-up. Hopefully both return in time for this game.

#### _History_

The first time these two danced, Seattle dominated thanks mostly to Trey Lance being forced to man the reins of the offense after injuries forced Garoppalo out of the game.  It was clear Lance was in no way prepared for the magnitude of the moment, and Seattle made sure to capitalize on the rookie's complete inexperience. 

It's way too tempting to think that things will go differently this time around.  San Francisco has found rhythm on offense, especially now that Jimmy Garoppalo is (arguably) playing some of the best football of his career. Meanwhile, Russell Wilson is sinking to new lows in his career, having had nothing but flaccid performances the past three weeks after returning from finger surgery. Furthermore, Seattle's home field advantage is no longer what it used to be. And while the Seahawk defense has sharpened over the past several weeks, it can't be considered elite in any capacity whatsoever. 

So why can't San Francisco notch a road win here? Three words - level of effort. San Francisco has just about every reason to sleepwalk through this game. Not only did it impress last week in a statement win against a resurgent Vikings team, but Seattle looked downright _pathetic_ in its loss against Washington the day after - a juggs machine would have racked up better stats than Russell Wilson last night. People are now claiming Russ is cooked. And in all truth, he probably is, give he's been on a downward trajectory since the bye last year. It was only the last couple weeks people finally noticed Russell lost so much of his moxie, so it shouldn't be much surprise to see the public fawning all over the 49ers this week.

But all this plays to Seattle's advantage, should San Francisco walk out on to the field playing decently below their potential. Not to mention these Seahawks still play with some feistiness, especially on defense. And the offense can produce occasionally despite missing a few pistons. It's possible the Hawks can surprise some folks here, especially a 49er team expecting an easy win. Some help is needed, but the opportunity is there to steal one from a heavy public favorite.

Not too cold, but humidity may be a factor here

Seahawks +3.5

**Seattle covers if**  
they can come out strong against a 49er team expecting an easy win against a pushover. The Seahawks need to establish the early lead and force the 49ers to play from behind for a good bit of the game.

**San Francisco covers if**  
Shanahan and Garoppalo find ways to keep this offense consistently productive against a spirited Seattle defense. It won't be easy especially considering Deebo Samuel will likely be ruled out for the game  
\- AND -  
Russell Wilson has truly lost the drive to fight for his team and win. After that  failing effort last week against Washington, I'd imagine Russell Wilson would convene with Shane Waldron and his supporting cast and work on fixing this offense.
