## Cowboys @ Saints

Dak finally scored a touchdown thanks to big plays from CeeDee Lamb and Amari Cooper. Both are fundamental to the functioning of this offense.

New Orleans with the hard play action leading to a wide open touchdown. Well done, Sean Payton.

DeMarcus Lawrence with a near sack fumble that would have closed out the game for the Cowboys. His presence is being felt.

The game was won by the Cowboys pass rush in its entirety. They've done some spectacular work.

## Colts @ Texans

Houston is so bad. Their cowardice, their quarterbacking, their lack of an identity on offense...nothing is working.

Indianapolis isn't even trying here, even though the cover is nearly guaranteed. It's sad. The Colts are simply content grinding this game out on the ground as much as possible.

## Washington @ Raiders

There's a book out there on the Raiders. For their offense to be stonewalled on so many drives, defensive coaches have keyed in on this offense. Every time they lose this year, their offense can never manage more than 20 points. Las Vegas isn't doing something right - maybe it's predictability? Maybe it's tells? Or maybe it's just a team that operates off ebbs and flows every week. 

Logan Thomas already making a big impact on this offense.

Heinecke and Gibson are tough sons of bitches. Kudos to Washington for being tough and constantly fighting to keep the game competitive.

Derek Carr's time to throw has to be studied here. He's holding the ball way too long, which usually indicates none of his receivers are open.

I notice Washington dropping linebackers into the intermediate area of the field...makes me wonder if (like the Chiefs) the Raiders offense is unable to operate in dribs and drabs.
