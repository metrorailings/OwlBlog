## Cowboys @ Saints

Dak finally scored a touchdown thanks to big plays from CeeDee Lamb and Amari Cooper. Both are fundamental to the functioning of this offense.

New Orleans with the hard play action leading to a wide open touchdown. Well done, Sean Payton.

DeMarcus Lawrence with a near sack fumble that would have closed out the game for the Cowboys. His presence is being felt.
