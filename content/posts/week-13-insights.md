## Browns @ Titans

Interesting to see Baker drop back and pass quite a bit in Cleveland's first drive....

Once again, Cleveland's coaches entrust their red zone offense to Baker Mayfield as a drop-back quarterback. And Baker almost disappoints, to be frank.

The Browns aren't shy about pulling out all the tricks today. I love it. The Browns truly want this game more than the Titans. Just the fact that Cleveland forced Derrick Henry's first fumble this year speaks volumes.

Cleveland's insistence on passing the ball in the red zone may be that critical wrinkle they added to their offense this week to catch Tenneessee off-guard.

Tannehill money on two big play-action throws, the second of which led to a touchdown.

## Bengals @ Dolphins

Chris Hubbard may be the best run defender on the Bengals.

Tua Tagovailoa making a very wrong decision on a read-pass option. Shame.

Two pedestrian rushes followed by a failed fade throw summed up the final series of plays Miami ran on a drive that ended in the red zone. I need to watch this game to see if the coaches have given Tua the freedom to drop back.

## Colts @ Texans

Deshaun Watson just exposing this Indy cover-two defense with intermediate throws over the middle. Predictability is a bad thing when the talent isn't living up to its full potential.

Chaz Green let up a drive-killing sack.

Deshaun Watson with his elusiveness and his speed is absolutely killer. If the Texans were better coached, Deshaun Watson would be talked about as an MVP candidate.

Chaz Green giving up yet another drive-killing sack, this time against all-decade player Brennan Scarlett.

The one time Watson was finally sacked, the Colts managed to close the gaps on the pocket. I wonder if they've been attempting far too many stunts and finesse plays here. If so, that would go a long way to explaining why Watson has been so elusive.

The Colts have finally established their ground game in the fourth quarter. Took a little while, but Houston needed to be worn down.

Rivers is an old man. An old, old man. That being said, good work by the Texans defense forcing Rivers to hold the ball longer. His immediate reads were taken away, it seems. Compare the second half passing numbers to the first half numbers.  Not to mention T.Y. Hilton was blanked in the second half.

## Giants @ Seahawks

Evan Engram doing just Evan Engram things. But kudos to Colt McCoy for at least moving the ball against this defense.

Giants defense has been doing some fantastic work keeping this team in there on multiple drives without any help from the offense. The complexity of their blitz packages, the decisiveness of their linebackers, their ability to guard the edge against the ground game, the shutdown ability James Bradberry provides....all these things matter.

Finally...the Giants mount a scoring drive here off nothing but the ground game. Three huge power runs from 12 formation was all New York needed to punch the ball into the end zone. Both Wayne Gallman and Alfred Morris were chewing off huge yardage here. The Giants offensive front deserve some real credit for their phenomenal run blocking here.
