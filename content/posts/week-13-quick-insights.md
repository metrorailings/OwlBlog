## Bears @ Lions

The Lions suck. Just something worth noting.

The Bears seem to suck more though. This new quarterback Brough is actually stepping up and making good plays in Chicago's loose zone coverage. Did the Bears' defensive backfield come into this match not giving a shit?

The Lions suck, particularly up front. Their pass rush is virtually nonexistant. Despite the Lions' hot start, the Bears have posted more yards on offense.

Detroit may be worse than the Giants at defense. I'm not kidding.
