## Bears @ Lions

The Lions suck. Just something worth noting.

The Bears seem to suck more though. This new quarterback Brough is actually stepping up and making good plays in Chicago's loose zone coverage. Did the Bears' defensive backfield come into this match not giving a shit?

The Lions suck, particularly up front. Their pass rush is virtually nonexistant. Despite the Lions' hot start, the Bears have posted more yards on offense.

Detroit may be worse than the Giants at defense. I'm not kidding.

## Bills @ Cowboys

The Bills have gotten a beat on this Cowboys passing offense. Though once again, the defense has been showing a vulnerability against the run.

The Cowboys' offensive front has been a little overwhelmed today, likely because of carefully planned blitzes.

***

## Packers @ Giants

Green Bay Packers two main cornerbacks like to place zone and stick to the far end of the field.

Saquon isn't that good in pass protection. And his vision as a halfback could use a bit more work, it appears.  Either that or Pat Shurmur needs to let Barkley be the type of runner he wants to be.

Once again, Green Bay does well on their initial scripted plays, then the offense falters very quickly afterwards.

Without the pass rush hitting home, the weak Giants secondary is left out to dry.

On offense, things aren't much better. Bungled snaps followed by a silly throw by Daniel Jones leading to an interception. This Giants product is a mess.

## Raiders @ Chiefs

Seems the Chiefs defense has picked up quite a few of the Raiders tendencies on offense. 

The Chiefs know the Raiders' route tree about as well as the Raiders. 

***

## Rams @ Cardinals

Cardinals soft-zone defense choked on a third-and-long.

The Cardinals and their soft zone choking even against crossing routes.

I wonder if the Rams defense is keying in on the Rams' short passing attack.

***

## Patriots @ Texans

The Patriots are gambling with man coverage against the Texans stacked receiver corps. And it hasn't panned out - the Texans burned New England on two separate downs, the latter resulting in a Houston touchdown.

Patriots love to blitz. But zero blitzes only work against inexperienced quarterbacks.

Texans linebacker Jake Martin finally stepping as a capable pass rusher against a good right tackle in Marcus Cannon.

Some sloppy long distance defense and an assignment being missed led to a Patriots touchdown. Still, it seems the Texans may be onto something, assigning a defensive back to blanket New England's halfback in coverage. Without an outlet leaking from the backfield, Tom Brady is left in even more desperate straits.

The Texans may actually have a functioning secondary here.

Deshaun Watson is targeting Johnathan Jones with zest.
