## Bears @ Lions

The Lions suck. Just something worth noting.

The Bears seem to suck more though. This new quarterback Brough is actually stepping up and making good plays in Chicago's loose zone coverage. Did the Bears' defensive backfield come into this match not giving a shit?

The Lions suck, particularly up front. Their pass rush is virtually nonexistant. Despite the Lions' hot start, the Bears have posted more yards on offense.

Detroit may be worse than the Giants at defense. I'm not kidding.

## Bills @ Cowboys

The Bills have gotten a beat on this Cowboys passing offense. Though once again, the defense has been showing a vulnerability against the run.

The Cowboys' offensive front has been a little overwhelmed today, likely because of carefully planned blitzes.

***

## Packers @ Giants

Green Bay Packers two main cornerbacks like to place zone and stick to the far end of the field.

Saquon isn't that good in pass protection. And his vision as a halfback could use a bit more work, it appears.  Either that or Pat Shurmur needs to let Barkley be the type of runner he wants to be.

Once again, Green Bay does well on their initial scripted plays, then the offense falters very quickly afterwards.

Without the pass rush hitting home, the weak Giants secondary is left out to dry.

On offense, things aren't much better. Bungled snaps followed by a silly throw by Daniel Jones leading to an interception. This Giants product is a mess.

***

## Raiders @ Chiefs

Seems the Chiefs defense has picked up quite a few of the Raiders tendencies on offense.

The Chiefs know the Raiders' route tree about as well as the Raiders.

***

## Rams @ Cardinals

Play-action is just throwing this Arizona defense into a dizzy.

Interesting tidbit. The Rams defensive front is purposely stretching their outside arms as they're rushing through the offensive line in order to keep Kyler Murray from scampering out at a sharp angle.

Cardinals having trouble covering tight-ends.

These Cardinals defense is playing soft.

Cardinals soft-zone defense choked on a third-and-long.

The Cardinals and their soft zone choking even against crossing routes.

I wonder if the Rams defense is keying in on the Rams' short passing attack.

## Patriots @ Texans

The Patriots are gambling with man coverage against the Texans stacked receiver corps. And it hasn't panned out - the Texans burned New England on two separate downs, the latter resulting in a Houston touchdown.

Patriots love to blitz. But zero blitzes only work against inexperienced quarterbacks.

Texans linebacker Jake Martin finally stepping as a capable pass rusher against a good right tackle in Marcus Cannon.

Some sloppy long distance defense and an assignment being missed led to a Patriots touchdown. Still, it seems the Texans may be onto something, assigning a defensive back to blanket New England's halfback in coverage. Without an outlet leaking from the backfield, Tom Brady is left in even more desperate straits.

The Texans may actually have a functioning secondary here.

Deshaun Watson is targeting Johnathan Jones with zest.

## 49ers @ Ravens

Marcus Peters having a bad day, giving up a long touchdown and missing a tackle that resulted in a 49ers first down.

The Ravens defensive coaches are drawing up some solid blitz schemes here. These blitzes are throwing Garoffalo off his game. A fumble and several bad throws so far.

Seriously speaking, Baltimore has been holding up very well in pass protection, probably thanks in no small part to the Ravens running game keeping defensive lines at bay.

Lamar Jackson's runs are so difficult to defend. His shiftiness, his speed, his fakes...almost impossible to counter.

The Ravens run defense still remains very questionable though.

Baltimore is a lot more willing to run offensive plays on 4th down given all their bells and whistles on that side of the ball.

Baltimore's receiving corps are more defined by their tight ends than their actual wide receivers.

Richard Sherman coming and making plays near the line of scrimmage.

Garoppalo hasn't been impressive in this game. A bad decision on third down ended a very promising drive. Not to mention he was bailed out by defensive pass interference on that drive anyway. I think the Ravens and their creative blitzes have warped the clock in his head.

Lamar's read-option runs are gashing this 49ers defense.

## Titans @ Colts

So far, Ryan Tannehill performing adequately under pressure.

This game really does illustrate why quarterback play is so important towards sustaining a drive.

Titans sustaining a great drive with nothing but power runs and screens. Some great conditioning on this team.

The Titans ran a direct snap to Derrick Henry on 2nd and 11. Fascinating.
