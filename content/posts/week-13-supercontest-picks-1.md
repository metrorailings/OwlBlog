Last week was another solid week. My losses were both bad beats. The Giants would have covered if Daniel Jones didn't tweak his hamstring or the referees didn't gift the Bengals with so many free yards on a **bullshit** pass interference call on their last scoring drive. Likewise, the Seahawks were just _begging _the Eagles to back into the cover. Seattle was literally out there just waving Philadelphia into their end zone. But the Eagles are on a mission this year to achieves levels of incompetence never before achieved in mankind's history. And true to this aim, Philadelphia failed to book the cover. 

Anyway, let's keep at it and keep cashing in these tickets.

### Football Team @ Steelers (-7.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Washington** (41) @ Cowboys (16)  
Ravens (14) @ **Steelers** (19)

#### _Record_

Washington (4-7)  
Steelers (11-0)

#### _Injuries_

The Football Team is coming into this game as healthy as can be.

The Steelers on the other hand may have a few issues. Starting cornerback Steven Nelson is hamstrung. Two of their depth offensive linemen may also be ruled out after being exposed to COVID. Throw James Conner on that COVID list as well. Most important of all though, Bud Dupree will no longer be present on the field given his season-ending ACL injury. Not good at all for a Steelers defense that prided itself on its beastly pass rush.

#### _History / Analysis_

Alex Smith was hit on upwards of 60% of his passing attempts last week against the Cowboys last week. Enter the Steelers with their league-leading pass rush. Washington catches a little break here now that the Steelers will be down one of their best pass rushers without Dupree, but Pittsburgh still has three other players who can steadily harass opposing quarterbacks.

#### _Weather_

Clear and cold

***

Steelers -7.5

***

**Pittsburgh covers if**  
Coming off a poor performance against a wrecked Baltimore team, the Steelers overcompensate against a Washington organization lacking talent across the board.  
\- OR -  
Defensive pressure forces Alex Smith into way too many ugly moments.

**Washington covers if**  
Alex Smith balls out against the Steelers defense using mostly short passes. Also, their defense needs to force Ben Roethlisberger to hold on to the ball a tick longer than normal so that their front has enough time to harangue him.

### Browns @ Titans (-5.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Browns** (27) @ Jaguars (25)  
**Titans** (45) @ Colts (26)

#### _Record_

Browns (8-3)  
Titans (8-3)

#### _Injuries_

Cleveland is fairly healthy, though they'll be missing the services of first cornerback Denzel Ward. They're also missing some depth among their wide receiver corps.

For the Titans, starting tight end Jonnu Smith and left guard Roger Saffold will likely not play in this game. Same with starting cornerback Adoree Jackson.

#### _History / Analysis_

Tennessee and Cleveland are similar in that both teams run offenses that are essentially derivatives of the Shanahan system. Both teams also harbor quite a few liabilities among their defensive ranks, though their defenses have been slowly improving over the past few weeks.

It'll be fascinating watching these two teams essentially play against themselves here. Whichever team adds more wrinkles to their offense to throw the other off will likely win the contest.

#### _Weather_

A little chilly

Browns +5.5

**Cleveland covers if**  
Kevin Stefanski can throw enough wrinkles into the offense to fool this Tennessee defense  
\- OR -  
the Titans are caught slacking after a big win against Indianapolis last week.

**Tennessee covers if**  
the Titans can carry over that same energy that propelled them to a statement win over the Colts last week.

### Rams @ Cardinals (+3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

49ers (20) @ **Rams** (23)  
Cardinals (17) @ **Patriots** (20)

#### _Record_

Rams (7-4)  
Cardinals (6-5)

#### _Injuries_

Los Angeles continues its lucky streak into the 13th week of the regular season here, showing up to another game in good health. The only significant injuries come to players at depth positions.

Arizona is a bit of a different story. Biggest injury is still Kyler Murray with a bum shoulder. While Murray will play, his injury does change up Arizona's strategy here, as they can no longer rely upon quarterback runs to jump-start this offense.

#### _History / Analysis_

Another fun match-up here. This Los Angeles defense purposefully lightens their presence in the box in order to throw more resources into pass coverage. Ideally, this should work in Arizona's favor, but Kyler's shoulder injury really limits the versatility of their ground game.

On the other side, Arizona's defense manufactures quarterback pressure through a variety of blitzes. Ideally, this should work well against quarterbacks who've shown a propensity to get easily flustered in years past like Jared Goff, but Goff has actually been navigating blitzes pretty well this year. Credit to Sean McVay for finding ways to work around his quarterback's shortcomings.

Rams -3

**Los Angeles covers if**  
they can stonewall Arizona's halfbacks and keep Kyler contained.

**Arizona covers if**  
their ground game pops off.

### Broncos @ Chiefs (-14)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Saints** (31) @ Broncos (3)  
**Chiefs** (27) @ Buccaneers (24)

#### _Record_

Broncos (4-7)  
Chiefs (10-1)

#### _Injuries_

The Broncos have a major issue in their secondary. Bryce Callahan going down with a foot injury is a major blow to a dangerously inexperienced cornerback group.

Kansas City will likely need to rely upon Leveon Bell in the run game given it's very possible Clyde Edwards-Helaire will be sidelined this week after not practicing at all.

#### _History / Analysis_

The last time these two squared off, the Chiefs forced four turnovers against Denver en route to a 27-point smashing. It's hard to imagine this game unfolding much differently. Then again, if there's one thing Denver did right that game, it was their ability to run the ball against a soft Kansas defensive front.

If the Broncos relied on the ground game instead of Drew Lock's manic arm, Denver could actually have a tiny shot at an upset here.

#### _Weather_

Cold and clear

Broncos +14

**Denver covers if**  
Pat Shurmur pulls his head out of his ass and lets Phillip LIndsay take the reins of this offense.

**Kansas City wins if**  
Denver remains as predictable as ever in their offense  
\- OR -  
Mahomes balls out against whatever rookie cornerback is taking Bryce Callahan's place.

### Bills @ 49ers (+2.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Chargers (17) @ **Bills** (27)  
**49ers** (23) @ Rams (20)

#### _Record_

Bills (8-3)  
49ers (5-6)

#### _Injuries_

Buffalo is mostly healthy across the board, though the loss of John Brown for the season will always hurt them in their deep passing game.

The 49ers will be a bit thin at cornerback. Their starting nickel back has been ruled out and it's possible his replacement may be sidelined as well.

#### _History / Analysis_

Both of these teams have some great coaches on their staff. Both of their offenses are thematically similar as well, in that both use misdirection and pre-snap motion to fool defenses. The Bills love throwing the ball deep though, whereas the 49ers prefer to run more plays behind the line of scrimmage.

Defensively, the Bills have one of the better pass coverage units in the league. I do expect Nick Mullin to get tripped up a few times by all the different ways Buffalo's secondary can morph coverage. But Buffalo's defensive front and linebackers do give up quite a few yards on the ground though, so the 49ers should be able to lean on their base offense. Josh Allen's proclivity to hold on to the ball may bite him in the ass here if Kerry Hyder, Javon Kinlaw, and Arik Armstead can find it within themselves to mount some sort of pass rush.

***

49ers +2.5

***

**San Francisco covers if**  
the 49ers, fueled by raw emotion after being forcefully isolated the past week, come out and dominate the trenches.  
\- OR -  
Buffalo isn't fully committed to this game mentally because they're looking ahead next week to their primetime showdown with the Steelers.

**Buffalo covers if**  
they're fully driven to win this game and their defense can limit San Francisco's outside zone rushes and other pseudo-run plays.

### Colts @ Texans (+3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Titans** (45) @ Colts (26)  
**Texans** (41) @ Lions (25)

#### _Record_

Colts (7-4)  
Texans (4-7)

#### _Injuries_

The Texans have injury and suspension problems. With Will Fuller suspended, Kenny Stills released, and Randall Cobb injured, their wide receiver corps has been reduced to Brandin Cooks and two bums. On top of that, the secondary is down its best player (and tone setter) in Bradley Roby.

The Colts may be in better shape. Three key players missing from last week's game will be back this week, two of them critical players along that defensive front. Indianapolis will be missing left tackle Anthony Castonzo, though it remains to be seen whether that matters much here as Houston really has a hard time rushing the passer, exotic blitzes aside.

#### _History / Analysis_

Last year's matches between these two teams really don't tell us much about this year, given all the things that's changed for these two since then. What I can tell you is that the Colts have one of the best defenses in the league. Houston, not even close. The Texans really struggle against opposing rushers, though that won't matter much as Indianapolis seems to have lost any swagger they've had in their ground game ever since Marlon Mack went to IR.

What will matter more here is the passing game, and the Texans should be worried here as Bradley Roby is no longer around to set the tone in that secondary. While Philip Rivers is nowhere near as great a quarterback as he once was, the man can still make good decisions and throw the ball so long as he's given enough time in the pocket. 

#### _Weather_

Beautiful day for some football.

Colts -3.5

**Indianapolis covers if**  
Houston's secondary and slow linebackers give up first downs to Indy's skill position players.

**Houston covers if**  
Deshaun Watson can somehow make magic with what little weaponry he has available to him. Houston's defense will need to find a way to gift their offense with additional possessions if they want to give Watson and company a shot at winning here.
