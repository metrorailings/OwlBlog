Last week was a much better outing. A return to form, almost. The only two picks that really soured on me were Miami and New England last week.

***

### Football Team @ Steelers (-7.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Washington** (41) @ Cowboys (16)  
Ravens (14) @ **Steelers** (19)

#### _Record_

Washington (4-7)  
Steelers (11-0)

#### _Injuries_

The Football Team is coming into this game as healthy as can be.

The Steelers on the other hand may have a few issues. Starting cornerback Steven Nelson is hamstrung. Two of their depth offensive linemen may also be ruled out after being exposed to COVID. Throw James Conner on that COVID list as well. Most important of all though, Bud Dupree will no longer be present on the field given his season-ending ACL injury. Not good at all for a Steelers defense that prided itself on its beastly pass rush.

#### _History / Analysis_

Alex Smith was hit on upwards of 60% of his passing attempts last week against the Cowboys last week. Enter the Steelers with their league-leading pass rush. Washington catches a little break here now that the Steelers will be down one of their best pass rushers without Dupree, but Pittsburgh still has three other players who can steadily harass opposing quarterbacks.

#### _Weather_

Clear and cold

***

Steelers -7.5

***

**Pittsburgh covers if**  
Coming off a poor performance against a wrecked Baltimore team, the Steelers overcompensate against a Washington organization lacking talent across the board.  
\- OR -  
Defensive pressure forces Alex Smith into way too many ugly moments.  

**Washington covers if**  
Alex Smith balls out against the Steelers defense using mostly short passes. Also, their defense needs to force Ben Roethlisberger to hold on to the ball a tick longer than normal so that their front has enough time to harangue him.

***

### Browns @ Titans (-5.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Browns** (27) @ Jaguars (25)  
**Titans** (45) @ Colts (26)

#### _Record_

Browns (8-3)  
Titans (8-3)

#### _Injuries_

Cleveland is fairly healthy, though they'll be missing the services of first cornerback Denzel Ward. They're also missing some depth among their wide receiver corps.

For the Titans, starting tight end Jonnu Smith and left guard Roger Saffold will likely not play in this game. Same with starting cornerback Adoree Jackson.

#### _History / Analysis_

Tennessee and Cleveland are similar in that both teams run offenses that are essentially derivatives of the Shanahan system. Both teams also harbor quite a few liabilities among their defensive ranks, though their defenses have been slowly improving over the past few weeks.

It'll be fascinating watching these two teams essentially play against themselves here. Whichever team adds more wrinkles to their offense to throw the other off will likely win the contest.

#### _Weather_

A little chilly

***

Browns +5.5

***

**Cleveland covers if**  
Kevin Stefanski can throw enough wrinkles into the offense to fool a Tennessee defense that may be slacking after a big win against Indianapolis last week.

**Tennessee covers if**  
the Titans can carry over that same energy that propelled them to a statement win over the Colts last week.
