Last week was a much better outing. A return to form, almost. The only two picks that really soured on me were Miami and New England last week.

### Football Team @ Steelers (-7.5)

#### _Latest Results_

**Football Team** (41) @ Cowboys (16)  
Ravens (12) @ **Steelers** (19)

#### _Record_

Raiders (6-4)  
Falcons (3-7)

#### _Injuries_

Raiders are mostly healthy. Clelin Ferrell's return should boost a pass rush that ranks as one of the worst in the league, though Rod Marinelli has made some remarkable strides with the unit over the past couple weeks.

The injury bug has been ripping through the Falcons offensive weaponry as of late. Julio Jones is legitimately questionable to play, as are Hayden Hurst. Todd Gurley has been blissfully ruled out though, so tailback duties will likely be split by his more promising back-ups.

#### _History_

The transitive property doesn't really apply well at predicting football games, but given that it's hard to compare these two teams as is, I have to resort to transitive comparisons here.

Both teams faced the Broncos, one week apart from one another. Both teams were able to dominate Denver, though Atlanta's defense played so soft in the fourth quarter that the Broncos were able to rally within one score before the final whistle blew. Still, put the fourth quarters of both games aside for a moment here and it seemed to me Las Vegas did a better job schooling Denver - the Raiders defensive game plan led to Drew Lock's worst ever game as a starter in this league. So from this perspective, Las Vegas has a slight edge.

Falcons +3

**Atlanta covers if**  
most of their talented weapons on offense are able to play and the team actually ends up rushing the ball with some juice now that Todd Gurley isn't there blowing chunks.

**Las Vegas covers if**  
the players take their fighting spirit on the road this week.
