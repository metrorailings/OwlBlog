#### Browns @ _Steelers_ (+2)

I can't help but feel that the Brownies are walking straight into a trap here. Coming off a big win, facing off against a team that it just dominated a few weeks ago (which is now starting a third-stringer at quarterback, mind you)...the reasons are there to phone this game in, especially with Freddie Kitchens' lackadaisical coaching.

The Steelers, on the other hand, should be hyped for this game. After being bullied by these fools just a few weeks ago, emotions are still very raw. I expect the Steelers' defensive front to have a hell of a time shredding through Cleveland's offensive front. And if that holds true, Baker Mayfield will be reduced to mush here. On the other side, Duck Hodges will make just enough plays to "upset" the Browns here.

#### Redskins @ _Panthers_ (-10)

Should I really pick middling teams as double-digit favorites? I guess we'll find out.

One thing to be said about Washington....the Redskins are awful. _Just awful_. Nothing sums up their commitment to sucking ass better than their rookie quarterback, Dwayne Haskins. If the Panthers can rack up quarterback hits here and force some turnovers, Carolina can cover this spread.

#### _49ers_ @ Ravens (-6)

From an Elo standpoint, the Ravens' ranking is inflated. After that big win, this spread literally jumped up 2 to 3 points in their favor. A little bit too much of a jump given that the 49ers are one of the three best teams in this league. Their defense can limit Lamar Jackson's production here.
