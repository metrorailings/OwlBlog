#### Browns @ _Steelers_ (+2)

While I understand that the Steelers are the better team here, I can't help but feel that the Brownies are walking straight into a trap here. Coming off a big win, facing off against a team that it just dominated a few weeks ago (and now starting a third-stringer at quarterback)...the groundwork is there to phone this game in, especially with Freddie Kitchens' lackadaisical coaching.

The Steelers, on the other hand, should be amped for this game. After being bullied by these fools just a few weeks ago, emotions are still very raw. I expect the Steelers' defensive front to have a hell of a time shredding through Cleveland's offensive front. Baker Mayfield should get his ass kicked here. Duck Hodges will make just enough plays to "upset" the Browns here.

#### Redskins @ _Panthers_ (-10)

Should I really pick middling teams as double-digit favorites? I guess we'll find out.

One thing to be said about Washington....they suck. And Dwayne Haskins epitomizes their suckiness perfectly.
