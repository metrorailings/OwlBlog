Not a great week, despite my high hopes - another 3-2 week. To be fair, the three games I picked correctly were all solid picks in that the outcomes of those games were never in question.

The other two selections though....those picks were ill-advised. I'm convinced the Bengals are way too happy playing half-heartedly against lesser opponents after a statement win. It may be weird at first labelling the Chargers as a lesser opponent when the spread only favored the Bengals by a few points, but the past several weeks haven't produced any banner moments for the franchise. If anything, their loss to the Broncos the week before led people to question whether their early-season success was fluky.  On top of that, Joe Mixon was bound to struggle against a defense built to stop zone-running teams.

The other pick was just silly. I had a bad feeling regarding the Raiders, but I was convinced the offense would find a way to post up twenty points against a Washington defense that's still rounding into form. I was mistaken - Washington's defense is so much better than I thought. Credit to Jack Del Rio for not only improving the defense, but finding a way to stonewall Oakland's offense for almost the entire game. Normally, Derek Carr and his offensive line show up against teams boasting solid defensive fronts, but the Raiders were just dumbfounded by the way the Football Team kept dropping linebackers into the intermediate area of the field, slamming shut any throwing windows to receivers running crossing routes past the flat.

Either way, I'll be more careful in my analysis of games going forward. A more holistic analysis is needed here, factoring in coaching as well as roster talent and injury situations.

### Cowboys @ Washington (+4)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**_Cowboys_** @ Saints (TNF)  
**_Washington_** @ Raiders

#### _Key Injuries_

Landon Collins may return this Sunday for Washington, although in limited capacity. Montez Sweat was hopeful to return as well, but a positive COVID result effectively killed his chances.

Cowboys are mostly healthy as well, notably when it comes to COVID. Randy Gregory is expected back in time for the game.

#### _History_

Washington swept Dallas off the floor both times they met last year. Of course, some things have changed since then. Dallas now boasts one of the league's best defenses, thanks in part to the efforts of its new defensive coordinator, Dan Quinn. Washington's quarterback situation has notably improved as well, from game manager Alex Smith to steely gunslinger Taylor Heinecke. Likewise, Dallas upgraded at the passer position now that Dak Prescott is back, though how much of an upgrade Prescott is over Dalton honestly remains to be determined. So last year's results can only bear so much predictive value here, but the way Washington outright dominated the Cowboys should concern Dallas backers here willing to lay points on the road against a division rival.

#### _Weather_

Expect some wet weather paired with occasional winds. Temperature is fantastic though, very unlike December.

Washington +4

***

**Washington covers if**  
they show more feisty spirit and resolve than the Cowboys. Unlike Dallas, Washington has demonstrated some serious mental fortitude on both sides of the ball over the past several weeks  
\- AND -  
Jack Del Rio strategizes somewhat successfully against Amari Cooper and CeeDee Lamb, limiting their production  
\- AND -  
Neither Ezekiel Elliott nor Pollard are able to find much success on the ground. Washington has been a bit better against opposing rushers lately, but it still has some ways to go before it can be considered one of the league's premier rushing defenses.

**Dallas covers if**  
Micah Parsons, DeMarcus Laurence, Randy Gregory, and the rest of their defensive front win the vast majority of their battles in the trenches. Heinecke will put up points against a Cowboys team playing some flawed man coverage in the defensive backfield, but how many points he puts up will be dictated by the pressure he faces. Even the grittiest quarterbacks eventually wilt when constantly harassed by pass rushers.

### Jaguars @ Titans (-8.5)

#### _Latest Results_

Jaguars @ **_Rams  
_**Titans @ **_Patriots_** \[BYE\]

#### _Key Injuries_

Julio Jones is practicing, though his status this Sunday is still up in the air. Safety Dane Cruikshank may join him in returning back from injured reserve too. The only real concerns are along their defensive front - Harold Landry and Denico Autry are practicing on a limited basis. At least one of these two will need to be active if Tennessee hopes to curb stomp the visiting Jaguars.

For Jacksonville, their center, their leading pass rusher, and one of their lead tacklers on defense haven't been practicing as of Wednesday. The latter two men on that list are especially concerning given they're likely the best players on that side of the ball. 

#### _History_

Both of these teams met earlier in the year in a blowout affair favoring the Titans. Things have changed somewhat since then - Tennessee no longer has Derrick Henry and A.J. Brown on their active roster and Jacksonville has...well....honestly, I'm not sure if the Jaguars have really changed much. One would think a generational talent like Trevor Laurence would be in much better form towards the tail end of the season, but the reality is Trevor's not showing much improvement. It may not be much his fault as the fault of his idiotic coaches. 

Speaking of which...the Jaguars may have the worst coaching staff in the league, a pretty impressive feat given the competition in New York and Houston. But the Jaguars have adopted this disastrous "coach-by-committee" approach that's been laughably inept, let alone inconsistent. The whole scandal over benching James Robinson hasn't sat well with the roster the past couple weeks, and I don't foresee Urban Meyer bettering relations between the coaches and the players any time soon.

#### _Weather_

Moderate weather, nothing concerning

***

Titans -8.5

***

**Tennessee covers if**  
the team plays hard, despite their opponent being a bottom feeder.

**Jacksonville covers if**  
Tennessee plays way too relaxed  
\- AND -  
the offense can sustain some production, primarily through its ground game.

### Seahawks @ Texans (+7.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

49ers @ **_Seahawks_**  
**_Colts_** @ Texans

#### _Key Injuries_

The Seahawks have lost Jamal Adams for the rest of the season due to a shoulder issue.

For the Texans, Tyrod Taylor has been knocked out of commission once again, so Davis Mills will be tasked to start in his stead this week.

#### _History_

No relevant history here, but Seattle appears to have righted the ship last week against a pretty good 49er squad. Houston, meanwhile, remains a dumpster fire that nobody's bothering to put out - the flames grow more putrid with each passing week. 

#### _Weather_

Pretty good weather for a vacation, I'd say

***

Seahawks -7.5

***

**Seattle covers if**  
their level of effort remains high despite the circumstances tempting them otherwise. It's too easy playing soft when you're celebrating a triumphant victory while your opponent comes off their most embarrassing defeat yet for the season.

**Houston covers if**  
the Seahawks are caught playing lazy  
\- AND -  
Davis Mills somehow strings together a few scoring drives. Virgin sacrifices might be necessary here.
