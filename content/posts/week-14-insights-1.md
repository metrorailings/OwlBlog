## Jaguars @ Titans

How does a team with so much internal strife play? Very sloppy. The penalties have been killing the Jaguars today. Probably most responsible for shutting them out.

Tennessee back to generating multiple turnovers on defense. But the offense could only put 17 points - Jacksonville's defensive line kept control in the trenches from what little action I saw.

## Cowboys @ Washington

Dallas stifling Washington's offense with its front four. The combination of Micah Parsons, Demarcus Lawrence, and Randy Gregory has been scary. And it's been enough to keep Washington from popping off. Washington tried to adjust by screens and crossing routes, but Dallas seemed one step ahead of them in that regard. Not sure what else Washington could do to stem the Cowboys and their pass rush, especially if they're rushing five.

## Seahawks @ Texans

Very slow start for the Seahawks, as expected. But Houston couldn't do nearly enough on offense to punish Seattle sleepwalking into the contest.

***

## Bills @ Buccaneers

Josh Allen not being helped by his sorry offensive line, as expected.

Brady on the cusp of breaking yet another record....aaaaand he does exactly that on a perfect lob to Mike Evans under some serious pressure through the mouth of the offensive line. Consider him an elite quarterback....maybe.

Two sorry throws from Brady ending a critical Bills drive. Worrying.

Tampa has been exceptionally lazy guarding against the run. I know Buffalo has never really ran the ball earlier in the season, but it's not good to see them so lackadaisical against Buffalo's rushers.

Tampa Bay was fortunate to cover.

In the first quarter alone, Mario Addison has made a few impact plays, though none of those plays amounted to hits on the quarterback.

Shaquil Barrett has been the one name on Tampa's defensive front I've noted on multiple occasions.

Interestingly enough, Buffalo made some serious hay in the second half by runs to the outside. It was these runs to the outside that opened up a few other plays for Buffalo.

Jason Pierre-Paul made his presence known on a few plays, but it's Shaquil Barrett who has been outstanding as a pass rusher.

Dawson Knox may be a real vector for the Bills. On top of that, Buffalo was robbed of a victory at the end, with the referees clearly doing the Buccaneers a favor by failing to flag their defensive backs for pass interference on two critical plays.

What the Bills need to be concerned about is that not one of their designated pass rushers really impressed on a consistent basis. A few of them flashed (Ed Oliver, Mario Addison, and Jerry Hughes) but arguably the best pass rusher on this team has been Matt Milano, who only rushes as part of the defense's blitzing packages on third down.

## Giants @ Chargers

Herbert keeping his passes mostly short, though he did connect on a deep beauty to Jalen Guyton to close out the first half.

Herbert threw a pass against the grain right on target. I'm starting to get comfortable calling him an elite quarterback.

***

## Lions @ Broncos

Broncos committing wholeheartedly to the running game, with Melvin Gordon and Javonte Williams seeing a good number of touches. It's working though. Denver might have the best running back tandem in the league, perhaps even better than Cleveland's.

Vic Fangio playing some horribly predictive prevent defense with most of the fourth quarter remaining. I know you're up by three touchdowns, but against competent offenses, the Broncos may well be surrendering that lead when the game ends.

## 49ers @ Bengals

San Francisco's defensive front has been absolutely dominant. Burrow threw two near-picks after facing down heavy pressure coming through the middle of the line. That and two opportune special-teams fumble have been the difference maker in this game.

Speaking of which, Cincinnati's special teams are a serious point of concern. Three muffed punts, two of which were lost to the 49ers...that's an ugly thing to lose a game over.

On top of that, Cincinnati surrendered a touchdown very late in the first-half thanks to one of their defenders taunting somebody on San Francisco's side. Just ridiculous - Zac Taylor's coaching has to be called into question here. His team has been playing ridiculously sloppy.

Deebo Samuel is back. And in true Deebo fashion, he's the one to score the team's first touchdown on an end-around.

It's clear to me that when these Bengals face a team with a dominant front seven like the 49ers, the team wilts. Not only does the offensive line struggle hard, but short routes don't develop as cleanly as well, forcing Burrow to hold the ball longer. Cincinnati tried to compensate in the second half by incorporating a variety of more rushes, but it didn't really pan out.

***

## Rams @ Cardinals

Kyler's passes have lacked touch, but Conner made a fantastic catch on an option route. James Conner is a true vector on offense.

Murray threw a pretty bad interception, though Aaron Donald may have tipped the pass. His small stature hurts him here. Is there a place under center for the little man?

Three defenders on Cooper Kupp and he still catches the ball. That alone proves his vector status.

The magic has manifested for the Cardinals. A deep pass to a well-covered receiver, followed up by _Aaron Donald_ whiffing on a tackle on a fourth down, letting James Conner run in for the touchdown.

Just sloppy man defense, letting the Rams open up some easy crossing routes against them. Still, credit to OBJ for generating a big play off one of those crossing routes,  even with multiple safeties in the backfield.

Another Kyler Murray interception, this one coming off Kyler trying to lob a pass over an edge rusher. Once again, his short stature and lack of touch aren't doing him any favors.

Sony Michel and Odell Beckham are starting to break out as weapons on this offense.

Rams have shown some remarkable toughness on a late drive to score a field goal and close out the game. Maybe things have changed?

No magic. The Cardinals just flat out sucked tonight. It's clear the whole team missed some crispness in their offense tonight. Kudos to Raheem Morris though. I was doubting him as a defensive coach under Sean McVay, but it's clear the Rams fully committed to keeping Kyler in the pocket. If Arizona was to win tonight, it'd be with Kyler as a pocket passer. And that just doesn't fly.

Nobody on the Cardinals defensive squad seemed to have stepped up aside from Chandler Jones. Same thing with the Rams and Aaron Donald.

The Rams absolutely love their wide receiver screens from the line of scrimmage. Probably a good way to mitigate opposing pass rushers every now and then while guaranteeing a completion.

This Zach Allen has flashed on multiple occasions for the Arizona Cardinals.

Von Miller and Leonard Floyd were key on a drive that ended in a critical interception to effectively seal the game away.

Notice that when the Rams are up by multiple scores, their defensive front lines up in a more typical pass rushing fashion. Interesting.

Leonard Floyd made his presence known on a few more plays, though none came as close to being impactful as any of his plays on the Cardinals drive that ended in an early interception.

Zach Allen needs to be seriously considered here as an elite pass rusher.

## Saints @ Jets

Zach Wilson is just awful. Just plain awful. It's not so much the Saints stopping him as it is him slipping up with his wild passes.

You know...the Jets are trying some interesting things on defense. Shifting defensive linemen, two-deep safety coverage shells, linebacker blitzes. Saleh's defense isn't nearly as simple as Lombardi presents it to be.

But the offense being absolutely hopeless essentially killed any morale this defense may have had entering the game. Sad.
