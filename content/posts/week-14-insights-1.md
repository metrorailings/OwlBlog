## Jaguars @ Titans

How does a team with so much internal strife play? Very sloppy. The penalties have been killing the Jaguars today. Probably most responsible for shutting them out.

Tennessee back to generating multiple turnovers on defense.

## Cowboys @ Washington

Dallas stifling Washington's offense with its front four. The combination of Micah Parsons, Demarcus Lawrence, and Randy Gregory has been scary. And it's been enough to keep Washington from popping off. Washington tried to adjust by screens and crossing routes, but Dallas seemed one step ahead of them in that regard. Not sure what else Washington could do to stem the Cowboys and their pass rush, especially if they're rushing five.
