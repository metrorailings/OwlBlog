## Jaguars @ Titans

How does a team with so much internal strife play? Very sloppy. The penalties have been killing the Jaguars today. Probably most responsible for shutting them out.

Tennessee back to generating multiple turnovers on defense. But the offense could only put 17 points - Jacksonville's defensive line kept control in the trenches from what little action I saw.

## Cowboys @ Washington

Dallas stifling Washington's offense with its front four. The combination of Micah Parsons, Demarcus Lawrence, and Randy Gregory has been scary. And it's been enough to keep Washington from popping off. Washington tried to adjust by screens and crossing routes, but Dallas seemed one step ahead of them in that regard. Not sure what else Washington could do to stem the Cowboys and their pass rush, especially if they're rushing five.

## Seahawks @ Texans

Very slow start for the Seahawks, as expected. But Houston couldn't do nearly enough on offense to punish Seattle sleepwalking into the contest.

***

## Bills @ Buccaneers

Josh Allen not being helped by his sorry offensive line, as expected.

Brady on the cusp of breaking yet another record....aaaaand he does exactly that on a perfect lob to Mike Evans under some serious pressure through the mouth of the offensive line. Consider him an elite quarterback.

## Giants @ Chargers

Herbert keeping his passes mostly short, though he did connect on a deep beauty to Jalen Guyton to close out the first half.

Herbert threw a pass against the grain right on target. I'm starting to get comfortable calling him an elite quarterback.

## Lions @ Broncos

Broncos committing wholeheartedly to the running game, with Melvin Gordon and Javonte Williams seeing a good number of touches. It's working though. Denver might have the best running back tandem in the league, perhaps even better than Cleveland's.

Vic Fangio playing some horribly predictive prevent defense with most of the fourth quarter remaining. I know you're up by three touchdowns, but against competent offenses, the Broncos may well be surrendering that lead when the game ends.
