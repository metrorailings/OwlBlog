## Jaguars @ Titans

How does a team with so much internal strife play? Very sloppy. The penalties have been killing the Jaguars today. Probably most responsible for shutting them out.

Tennessee back to generating multiple turnovers on defense. But the offense could only put 17 points - Jacksonville's defensive line kept control in the trenches from what little action I saw.

## Cowboys @ Washington

Dallas stifling Washington's offense with its front four. The combination of Micah Parsons, Demarcus Lawrence, and Randy Gregory has been scary. And it's been enough to keep Washington from popping off. Washington tried to adjust by screens and crossing routes, but Dallas seemed one step ahead of them in that regard. Not sure what else Washington could do to stem the Cowboys and their pass rush, especially if they're rushing five.

## Seahawks @ Texans

Very slow start for the Seahawks, as expected. But Houston couldn't do nearly enough on offense to punish Seattle sleepwalking into the contest.

***

## Bills @ Buccaneers

Josh Allen not being helped by his sorry offensive line, as expected.

Brady on the cusp of breaking yet another record....aaaaand he does exactly that on a perfect lob to Mike Evans under some serious pressure through the mouth of the offensive line. Consider him an elite quarterback....maybe.

Two sorry throws from Brady ending a critical Bills drive. Worrying.

Tampa has been exceptionally lazy guarding against the run. I know Buffalo has never really ran the ball earlier in the season, but it's not good to see them so lackadaisical against Buffalo's rushers.

Tampa Bay was fortunate to cover.

## Giants @ Chargers

Herbert keeping his passes mostly short, though he did connect on a deep beauty to Jalen Guyton to close out the first half.

Herbert threw a pass against the grain right on target. I'm starting to get comfortable calling him an elite quarterback.

***

## Lions @ Broncos

Broncos committing wholeheartedly to the running game, with Melvin Gordon and Javonte Williams seeing a good number of touches. It's working though. Denver might have the best running back tandem in the league, perhaps even better than Cleveland's.

Vic Fangio playing some horribly predictive prevent defense with most of the fourth quarter remaining. I know you're up by three touchdowns, but against competent offenses, the Broncos may well be surrendering that lead when the game ends.

## 49ers @ Bengals

San Francisco's defensive front has been absolutely dominant. Burrow threw two near-picks after facing down heavy pressure coming through the middle of the line. That and two opportune special-teams fumble have been the difference maker in this game.

Speaking of which, Cincinnati's special teams are a serious point of concern. Three muffed punts, two of which were lost to the 49ers...that's an ugly thing to lose a game over.

On top of that, Cincinnati surrendered a touchdown very late in the first-half thanks to one of their defenders taunting somebody on San Francisco's side. Just ridiculous - Zac Taylor's coaching has to be called into question here. His team has been playing ridiculously sloppy.

Deebo Samuel is back. And in true Deebo fashion, he's the one to score the team's first touchdown on an end-around.

## Rams @ Cardinals

Kyler's passes have lacked touch, but Conner made a fantastic catch on an option route. James Conner is a true vector on offense.

Murray threw a pretty bad interception, though Aaron Donald may have tipped the pass. His small stature hurts him here. Is there a place under center for the little man?
