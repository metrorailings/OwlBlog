## Cardinals @ Giants

Giants suck on special teams. Little worrying given Joe Judge is supposed to be a special teams maven.

Seems like the Cardinals defensive front have keyed in on the weaknesses of the Giants offensive line. Either that or the Giants simply struggle handling the blitz.

Nothing but man coverage against New York's defenders. Seems to be working though, none of the Giants receivers are really shaking free. Is that more because of scheme or more because Daniel Jones is just not reading the open routes first?

Once again, the Giants haven't adjusted on offense in the second half. No quick routes or mesh routes to ward off Arizona's underneath man coverage. Jones insisting on holding the ball in the pocket. Pretty damning indictment on Jason Garrett and Daniel Jones.

Andrew Thomas once again exposed as a liability in pass protection. Disappointing.

## Broncos @ Panthers

Panthers defense playing with very little discipline, gifting two first downs to Denver on unnecessary penalties on a drive that led to a touchdown.

The deep ball seems to work all too well against this Carolina secondary. I don't get it. Do they not understand the Broncos love throwing the ball deep?

## Saints @ Eagles

Disappointing start for the Saints. Already gave up a significant run to Jalen Hurts.
