## Cardinals @ Giants

Giants suck on special teams. Little worrying given Joe Judge is supposed to be a special teams maven.

Seems like the Cardinals defensive front have keyed in on the weaknesses of the Giants offensive line. Either that or the Giants simply struggle handling the blitz.

Nothing but man coverage against New York's defenders. Seems to be working though, none of the Giants receivers are really shaking free. Is that more because of scheme or more because Daniel Jones is just not reading the open routes first?

Once again, the Giants haven't adjusted on offense in the second half. No quick routes or mesh routes to ward off Arizona's underneath man coverage. Jones insisting on holding the ball in the pocket. Pretty damning indictment on Jason Garrett and Daniel Jones.

Andrew Thomas once again exposed as a liability in pass protection. Disappointing.

## Broncos @ Panthers

Panthers defense playing with very little discipline, gifting **three** first downs to Denver on unnecessary penalties on a drive that led to a touchdown.

Duke Dawson left the game pretty early. And with that, Denver is scraping the very bottom of their secondary depth. So how did Carolina blow this game? We'll find out.

Teddy Bridgewater and the rest of the Panthers are playing slightly sloppy. Makes me realize that teams coming off the bye are probably more likely to playing at half-speed instead of full strength. Never trust another team coming off the bye unless the moment is too juicy.

Denver nailed a touchdown in 4 plays to open the second-half. Sad, but I think this Carolina team is a bit rudderless coming out of the bye. It's becoming clear to me that teams coming off byes need time to rev up.

## Saints @ Eagles

Disappointing start for the Saints. Already gave up a few significant runs to Jalen Hurts. It's the one thing that can't be done.

Big touchdown pass from Jalen Hurts under duress on fourth down. Well done. Props to Alshon Jeffery for the reception.

Taysom Hill not playing with any sort of gusto.

Failed quarterback draw on third down. Not a good omen for the Saints.

Taysom came out firing in the second half, even reading a few of the blitzes and making good throws. Nothing but solid passes so far. It helps that the Eagles two starting cornerbacks are out.

This offense is different once Jalen Hurts settles into a rhythm. Hurts and his mobility add a much needed element to an offense built more for rushing than passing.

The Saints lost this game because of their inability to contain Jalen Hurts. As simple as that. New Orleans played their base nickel defense when they really should have stacked the box and forced Hurts to beat them with his shoddy arm. Pretty surprised to see the Saints defensive braintrust disappoint me today the way they did.

## Steelers @ Bills

Pittsburgh's man coverage defenders have been doing some outstanding work. It helps that the Steelers have been truly committed to the pass rush though. With five to six defenders crashing through the offensive line (up to three of whom can be considered elite), Josh Allen doesn't have much time to stand around before pulling the trigger.

Seems like Bills are running more curl routes in the second half to avail Josh Allen of more quicker routes. It's about time. What made the Bills actually think holding the ball waiting for deeper routes to develop would be a strategy for success? It baffles me that some teams absolute refuse to adjust their identity based on the opponent.

Steelers are absolutely convinced pressure is the only way to win this game, not effective man coverage. It makes sense given how long Josh Allen typically holds the ball.
