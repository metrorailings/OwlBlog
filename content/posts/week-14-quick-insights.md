## 49ers @ Saints

As expected, the Saints are working the 49ers in the short game, as the Cardinals did not too long ago.

Absence of Jaquiski Tartt at deep safety made a difference on an intermediate throw to Jared Cook for a touchdown.

49ers picking on Eli Apple on three consecutive downs for big plays. Eli Apple seems to have a hard time guarding the slant.

49ers coming into this game well-coached and ready, given the success of their first drive.

Nick Bosa having an impact on this game, stunting the Saints on two downs.

Deonte Harris making his presence known as a speedster on offense.

49ers pass protection is holding up. Although it does help that the Saints are biting hard on play-action. New Orleans needs to play more assignments on defense. Kudos to Kyle Shanahan for outcoaching Dennis Allen though.

Good play-calling by Sean Payton right near the goal line. Called a power run on 3rd down that set up an easy quarterback sneak on 4th down. 

The Saints defensive line are not winning upfront. Shanahan is punking this defense.

49ers seem to have three solid skill players on offense - Deebo Samuel, Emmanuel Sanders, and George Kittle. Also helps that the team can run the ball with a combination of different halfbacks. And unlike Kyle Shanahan's Falcons the year they went to the Super Bowl, this team may have multiple pass rushers worth a damn.

Nick Bosa can be designated an elite pass rusher. Nobody else has really impressed me as of yet on this 49er defensive front.

New Orleans doesn't have much of a pass rush in this game. Cameron Jordan may be the only elite pass rusher on that defense.

## Chiefs @ Patriots

Trick play by the Patriots for a touchdown - a sliding flea flicker. Well done by Josh McDaniels. Brady's pass was a bit underthrown too. Makes me wonder... 

Chris Jones already working the interior of the Patriots offensive line. Him putting the heat on Brady ended a Patriots drive coming off a turnover.

Once again, Brady underthrowing yet another pass that might have put New England in fringe field-goal range.

Patriots pass rush is anemic. If New England, they may be able to thank Mahomes untimely hand injury for the cheap win.

Patriots struggling to run this ball. Their success has largely come courtesy of the pass.

Brady showing his age. A bad decision (abetted a bit by pressure) led to an interception deep on the Patriots side of the field.

Kyle Van Noy making plays against the run, as an elite defender should.

Brady's depth receivers are letting him down. That and Kansas City has found a solution here with the blitz, apparently.
