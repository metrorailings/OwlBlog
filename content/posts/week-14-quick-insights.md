## 49ers @ Saints

As expected, the Saints are working the 49ers in the short game, as the Cardinals did not too long ago.

Absence of Jaquiski Tartt at deep safety made a difference on an intermediate throw to Jared Cook for a touchdown.

49ers picking on Eli Apple on three consecutive downs for big plays. Eli Apple seems to have a hard time guarding the slant.

49ers coming into this game well-coached and ready, given the success of their first drive.

Nick Bosa having an impact on this game, stunting the Saints on two downs.

Deonte Harris making his presence known as a speedster on offense.

49ers pass protection is holding up. Although it does help that the Saints are biting hard on play-action. New Orleans needs to play more assignments on defense. Kudos to Kyle Shanahan for outcoaching Dennis Allen though.

Good play-calling by Sean Payton right near the goal line. Called a power run on 3rd down that set up an easy quarterback sneak on 4th down. 

The Saints defensive line are not winning upfront. Shanahan is punking this defense.

49ers seem to have three solid skill players on offense - Deebo Samuel, Emmanuel Sanders, and George Kittle. Also helps that the team can run the ball with a combination of different halfbacks. And unlike Kyle Shanahan's Falcons the year they went to the Super Bowl, this team may have multiple pass rushers worth a damn.

Nick Bosa can be designated an elite pass rusher. Nobody else has really impressed me as of yet on this 49er defensive front.

New Orleans doesn't have much of a pass rush in this game. Cameron Jordan may be the only elite pass rusher on that defense.

## Chiefs @ Patriots

Trick play by the Patriots for a touchdown - a sliding flea flicker. Well done by Josh McDaniels. Brady's pass was a bit underthrown too. Makes me wonder... 

Chris Jones already working the interior of the Patriots offensive line. Him putting the heat on Brady ended a Patriots drive coming off a turnover.

Once again, Brady underthrowing yet another pass that might have put New England in fringe field-goal range.

Patriots pass rush is anemic. If New England, they may be able to thank Mahomes untimely hand injury for the cheap win.

Patriots struggling to run this ball. Their success has largely come courtesy of the pass.

Brady showing his age. A bad decision (abetted a bit by pressure) led to an interception deep on the Patriots side of the field.

Kyle Van Noy making plays against the run, as an elite defender should.

Brady's depth receivers are letting him down. That and Kansas City has found a solution here on defense, blitzing an overmatched offensive line. Combine that with a lack of a run game and it makes things almost impossible for New England here.

You take away Edelman and James White, you're left with a dysfunctional Patriots offense. Belichick and Brady poured their hearts into this game and still lost.

## Ravens @ Bills

Ravens start their first drive executing mostly pass plays. Interesting. Let's see if they still insist on Lamar heaving the ball against the Bills elite pass defense. 

Their second drive was run-heavy. Coincidentally, the Ravens were able to post their first points on the board at the end of the drive.

Once again, an exotic run play leads to a touchdown for this Ravens offense. This Bills defense showing spunk though.

Bills did mostly well defensing the run. It was the Ravens and their blitzes that threw this Buffalo offense out of its groove until the game was too out of hand. Ravens were almost too happy blitzing, almost as if they weren't worried about Josh Allen being able to dissect their undermanned pass coverage.

Ravens man coverage defenders did incredibly well guarding against Buffalo's smaller and more agile receiver unit. That's two weeks in a row now that the Ravens defensive backfield held up against a receiver corps known more for speed than size.

## Redskins @ Packers

I honestly wonder whether it's easier stopping an offense that can rush the ball well or running against a defense that struggles to neutralize the ground game.

Dear lord...Haskins is just awful.

Aaron Jones is something special when he accelerates into the second level. And it's quite impressive to see Green Bay just lining up in power run formations and pound the ball for big yardage.

The Smith brothers can both be considered elite pass rushers so far. Za'Darius is clearly the better half in the duo though. The Redskins were finally making hay through power runs until Za'Darius finally forced a negative play by shooting through an interior gap. It didn't matter as Dwayne Haskins was able to convert on a 3rd and long.

Lazard making a big catch to keep the chains moving.
