## 49ers @ Saints

As expected, the Saints are working the 49ers in the short game, as the Cardinals did not too long ago.

Absence of Jaquiski Tartt at deep safety made a difference on an intermediate throw to Jared Cook for a touchdown.

49ers picking on Eli Apple on three consecutive downs for big plays. Eli Apple seems to have a hard time guarding the slant.

49ers coming into this game well-coached and ready, given the success of their first drive.

Nick Bosa having an impact on this game, stunting the Saints on two downs.

Deonte Harris making his presence known as a speedster on offense.

49ers pass protection is holding up. Although it does help that the Saints are biting hard on play-action. New Orleans needs to play more assignments on defense. Kudos to Kyle Shanahan for outcoaching Dennis Allen though.
