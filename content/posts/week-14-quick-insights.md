## 49ers @ Saints

As expected, the Saints are working the 49ers in the short game, as the Cardinals did not too long ago.

Absence of Jaquiski Tartt at deep safety made a difference on an intermediate throw to Jared Cook for a touchdown.

49ers picking on Eli Apple on three consecutive downs for big plays. Eli Apple seems to have a hard time guarding the slant.

49ers coming into this game well-coached and ready, given the success of their first drive.

Nick Bosa having an impact on this game, stunting the Saints on two downs.

Deonte Harris making his presence known as a speedster on offense.

49ers pass protection is holding up. Although it does help that the Saints are biting hard on play-action. New Orleans needs to play more assignments on defense. Kudos to Kyle Shanahan for outcoaching Dennis Allen though.

Good play-calling by Sean Payton right near the goal line. Called a power run on 3rd down that set up an easy quarterback sneak on 4th down.

The Saints defensive line are not winning upfront. Shanahan is punking this defense.

49ers seem to have three solid skill players on offense - Deebo Samuel, Emmanuel Sanders, and George Kittle. Also helps that the team can run the ball with a combination of different halfbacks. And unlike Kyle Shanahan's Falcons the year they went to the Super Bowl, this team may have multiple pass rushers worth a damn.

Nick Bosa can be designated an elite pass rusher. Nobody else has really impressed me as of yet on this 49er defensive front.

New Orleans doesn't have much of a pass rush in this game. Cameron Jordan may be the only elite pass rusher on that defense.

I wonder if New Orleans has a tendency to play their cornerbacks more in outside technique. If so, it makes their linebackers all the more valuable, as that unit is essentially the first line of defense against crossing routes. It would explain how Jared Goff had a hell of a game against these Saints last year.

Then again, the corners may be playing outside technique as they're counting on the safeties to defend the real dangerous crossing routes. And these Saint safeties are just awful.

Kyle Shanahan is playing this Saints defense like a fiddle, even predicting when New Orleans will run man coverage.

## Chiefs @ Patriots

Trick play by the Patriots for a touchdown - a sliding flea flicker. Well done by Josh McDaniels. Brady's pass was a bit underthrown too. Makes me wonder...

Chris Jones already working the interior of the Patriots offensive line. Him putting the heat on Brady ended a Patriots drive coming off a turnover.

Once again, Brady underthrowing yet another pass that might have put New England in fringe field-goal range.

Patriots pass rush is anemic. If New England, they may be able to thank Mahomes untimely hand injury for the cheap win.

Patriots struggling to run this ball. Their success has largely come courtesy of the pass.

Brady showing his age. A bad decision (abetted a bit by pressure) led to an interception deep on the Patriots side of the field.

Kyle Van Noy making plays against the run, as an elite defender should.

Brady's depth receivers are letting him down. That and Kansas City has found a solution here on defense, blitzing an overmatched offensive line. Combine that with a lack of a run game and it makes things almost impossible for New England here.

You take away Edelman and James White, you're left with a dysfunctional Patriots offense. Belichick and Brady poured their hearts into this game and still lost.

## Ravens @ Bills

Ravens start their first drive executing mostly pass plays. Interesting. Let's see if they still insist on Lamar heaving the ball against the Bills elite pass defense.

Their second drive was run-heavy. Coincidentally, the Ravens were able to post their first points on the board at the end of the drive.

Once again, an exotic run play leads to a touchdown for this Ravens offense. This Bills defense showing spunk though.

Bills did mostly well defensing the run. It was the Ravens and their blitzes that threw this Buffalo offense out of its groove until the game was too out of hand. Ravens were almost too happy blitzing, almost as if they weren't worried about Josh Allen being able to dissect their undermanned pass coverage.

Ravens man coverage defenders did incredibly well guarding against Buffalo's smaller and more agile receiver unit. That's two weeks in a row now that the Ravens defensive backfield held up against a receiver corps known more for speed than size.

## Redskins @ Packers

I honestly wonder whether it's easier stopping an offense that can rush the ball well or running against a defense that struggles to neutralize the ground game.

Dear lord...Haskins is just awful.

Aaron Jones is something special when he accelerates into the second level. And it's quite impressive to see Green Bay just lining up in power run formations and pound the ball for big yardage.

The Smith brothers can both be considered elite pass rushers so far. Za'Darius is clearly the better half in the duo though. The Redskins were finally making hay through power runs until Za'Darius finally forced a negative play by shooting through an interior gap. It didn't matter as Dwayne Haskins was able to convert on a 3rd and long.

Lazard making a big catch to keep the chains moving for the Packers offense.

Washington is just injured. Quarterback is operating on one leg, their best pass rusher is dealing with a leg injury, and their best halfback has been ruled out in the first half with a knee injury.

Aaron Rodgers is seriously struggling to find open receivers, despite having several seconds in the pocket on multiple occasions.

Yes, it is easier to defend a good rushing team than to rush the ball against a bad team. All a defense needs to stop the run is to put more men in the box. I wish I knew this for the Patriots game.

## Steelers @ Cardinals

Steeler fans travel well.

Why is Kyler playing so scared? Kliff should be scheming these quick plays better.

I have to say...Kyler may be shitting himself here. I wonder if being hit by NFL linemen is taking its toll on him mentally.

Better plan from Kyler following that Pittsburgh turnovers. Though any success I saw on that drive came more from scheme than quarterback play. Still, the Steelers defense are doing a solid job limiting Kyler Murray's options here. Even when Kyler attempted to run the ball outside, Minkah Fitzpatrick immediately cut him off.

Finally, the up-tempo play-calling is yielding results for this Arizona offense. Steelers are trying their damnedest to confuse Kyler by crowding the line of scrimmage with linebackers though.

Duck Hodges making hay with scramble runs.

## Titans @ Raiders

Raiders are dismal against the pass.

Ryan Tannehill really impressing in a bit of a tough situation here, delivering on a touchdown bomb while under severe duress.

Raiders can run the ball with backs other than Josh Jacobs.

Oakland committing to stopping the run, lining up quite a bit in their 4-3 base defense.

Likewise, Tennessee looking to cut the Raiders off on their short yardage plays. The Titans defensive backs overplayed the flat on one play, giving up an easy touchdown heave.

Oakland may have some of the worst defensive backs in the league.

Tennessee may have issues of their own as well in their defensive backfield.

Titans play pretty intelligently on defense.

Tennessee's offense has some character to it. Hurrying the pace at the correct moments, calling semi-trick plays towards the end of the game to close things out...

## Seahawks @ Rams

Seahawks and Rams know each other a little too well.

On one play, the Seahawks tried to bait Jared Goff into throwing a wide receiver screen in a situation that seemingly favored such a screen. The Rams anticipated this, as one of the skill players that the Seahawks presumed would be blocking ended up releasing and running a fly and catching a big throw to set LA up for a touchdown.

Likewise on defense, the Rams still kept seven men in the box even though the Seahawks spread four receivers out. The Rams were correct to do so though, as the Hawks ended up running the ball.

If Goff can be scripted into rhythm, this Rams offense looks so much better.  While Goff might not be worth much as a dropback passer, he can certainly execute on scheme plays.

Two errors killed a Seahawks drive.
