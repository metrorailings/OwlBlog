## 49ers @ Saints

As expected, the Saints are working the 49ers in the short game, as the Cardinals did not too long ago.

Absence of Jaquiski Tartt at deep safety made a difference on an intermediate throw to Jared Cook for a touchdown.

49ers picking on Eli Apple on three consecutive downs for big plays. Eli Apple seems to have a hard time guarding the slant.
