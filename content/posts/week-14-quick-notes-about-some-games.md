#### New York Jets @ Buffalo Bills (-4)

Tempting to go with the Bills here after Josh Allen's solid performance last week in Miami, but Sam Darnold will finally make his heralded return this week. Hmmm...Darnold usually flounders when pressured, but maybe his game actually steps up a notch coming back from injury? How likely does that sound?

**Pick: Bills -4**

#### New York Giants @ Washington Redskins (+3)

I would love to bet on the Giants here given that the Redskins are starting their third-string quarterback...but with Odell Beckham injured and Landon Collins suffering a torn labrum last week, the Giants are without their best players on offense and defense. Do I trust Eli and Pat Shurmur enough to cover on the road here, even against a team as sad as the Redskins? I honestly don't know.
