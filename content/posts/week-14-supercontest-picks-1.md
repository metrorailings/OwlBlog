headline = "Week 14 Supercontest Picks"

+++
I still have a ways to go in my gambling journey. My Sunday was beyond phenomenal. All my picks were on point. It was amazing.

Then Monday came and threw me into a depression. Not only did the Steelers fail to cover, but they outright lost against Washington. Then San Francisco crashed and burned in what was supposed to be an emotional outing against the Bills.

As much as I hate saying this, both of those games were terrible picks on my part. The reality is that the Steelers haven't been good offensively for several weeks now. On top of that, their players have been exhausted for the last couple weeks. Against a solid defense like Washington's, the team expectedly fell apart. As for the other game, Brian Daboll and Josh Allen have been too good this season. I suppose I was banking on Allen regressing back to the mean this game against an emotionally wrought San Francisco team, but I was proven wrong. If anything, his performance has me convinced now that his jump this year is no fluke.

Once again, a key rule of thumb here is to try and not go against good coaches unless the line gives you some serious flexibility. Good coaches usually dictate which side of the line will end up being correct.

### Saints @ Eagles (+7)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Saints** (21) @ Falcons (16)  
Eagles (16) @ **Packers** (30)

#### _Record_

Saints (10-2)  
Eagles (3-8-1)

#### _Weather_

Good, solid weather.

#### _Injuries_

Saints will be missing a couple pieces along their defense, but will otherwise show to this game fully healthy. Brees remains on injured reserve with his rib issues.

The Eagles were a bit thin along their defensive backfield, but injuries seem to be a consistent theme for Philadelphia this season. None of the injuries this week really hurt this team much more than it's already been hurting.

#### _History / Analysis_

The Eagles are a bloody mess. Jalen Hurts may give this offense some desperately needed spark. But the issue with the Eagles runs deeper than quarterback. The offensive line is a mess. Doug Pederson insists on a running a pass-heavy offense despite Miles Sanders being his most productive player. All their receivers have taken a step back, especially Alshon Jeffery.

The only point of strength for Philadelphia is their defensive line - the team still features one of the best set of pass rushers in the league. Not sure if that'll be enough though given the Saints arguable have the best offensive line in the league. Not to mention Taysom Hill is built to shake pass rushers with his size and speed.

***

Saints -7

***

**New Orleans covers if**  
their pass rushers can keep Jalen Hurts hemmed in the pocket. The Saints defensive linemen need to mount pressure mostly through bull rushes. It wouldn't be the first time this season New Orleans sustained a pass rush solely off bull rushes.

**Philadelphia covers if**  
Jalen Hurts actually ends up impressing against one of the league's best defenses. It's remotely possible if he's allowed to break from the pocket and run at will.

### Cardinals @ Giants (+1.5)

#### _Latest Results_

**Rams** (38) @ Cardinals (28)  
**Giants** (17) @ Seahawks (12)

#### _Record_

Cardinals (6-6)  
Giants (5-7)

#### _Weather_

It's a beautiful day for football.

#### _Injuries_

Arizona has some players on the mend, but most players are expected to play. Only starting inside linebacker De'Vondre Campbell may be ruled out come Sunday.

The Giants seem ready to welcome Daniel Jones back into the fold. Blake Martinez's game status is iffy though, given the nature of his injury and his lack of practice this week. 

#### _History / Analysis_

The Cardinals spent the better part of last month flopping around with their bellies exposed to the sun. To me, the past couple weeks confirmed suspicions I've held for a while now - Kliff Kingsbury is so mediocre at play calling. As a result, the Cardinals are forced to live and die by Kyler's legs.

New York proved last week that it can contain a mobile quarterback for an entire game. And now we have another mobile quarterback coming into town, one who's slightly faster but not quite that nuanced with his throws. Things seem to be pointing towards the Giants direction here.

***

Giants +2.5

***

**New York covers if**  
Daniel Jones is healthy enough to start the game  
\- OR -  
their defensive front can corral Kyler Murray and his tailbacks.

**Arizona covers if**  
the Cardinals can establish a ground game and Daniel Jones is not healthy enough to play.

### Texans @ Bears (+1)

#### _Latest Results_

**Colts** (26) @ Texans (20)  
**Lions** (34) @ Bears (30)

#### _Record_

Texans (4-8)  
Bears (5-7)

#### _Weather_

It's a cold one.

#### _Injuries_

Phillip Gaines is out for the Texans, leaving them dangerously thin at cornerback against hall of famer Mitch Trubisky.

The Bears have similar problems at cornerback with Buster Skrine out, though their depth chart should be able to fill in admirably.

#### _History / Analysis_

It's almost too easy to bag this Chicago offense, even after their sterling showing against Detroit last week. But the reality is this Houston offense would be just as dismal without the theatrics of Deshaun Watson.

It's worth noting these two teams faced off against Detroit in back-to-back weeks recently. Normally, I'd use those games to draw comparisons here, but it's hard to put any faith in any such comparison. For one thing, Will Fuller was very healthy when the Texans played the Lions. Also, Matt Patricia was still coaching the Lions when Houston dropped 40 on them. The Lions did win against the Bears, but perhaps that victory was fueled by newfound energy following Matt Patricia's firing, I'm not too sure. So it's hard to contrast these two teams.

***

Texans -1

***

**Houston covers if**  
Deshaun Watson uses last week's crushing loss against the Colts to play the Bears with added intensity. Houston will also need to limit any juice Chicago can squeeze from their ground game.

**Chicago covers if**  
their defensive front stifles Deshaun Watson for the better part of the game.  
\- OR -  
their running game from last week carries over this week against a Houston team that's been known to struggle against opposing rushers.

### Broncos @ Panthers (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Broncos (16) @ **Chiefs** (22)  
BYE - Panthers (27) @ **Vikings** (28)

#### _Record_

Broncos (4-8)  
Panthers (4-8)

#### _Weather_

Stunning weather, but the field might be a bit wet from some rain the night before.

#### _Injuries_

Denver is a mess in their secondary. Both of their starting cornerbacks are out, as is  rookie understudy Essang Bassey. Their inexperienced depth will be tested here. On top of that, starting guard Graham Glasgow is also out.

Carolina is in better shape. Honestly, their biggest injury concerns are Christian McCaffrey and DJ Moore, both weapons that could be really productive against a green Denver passing coverage unit. Still, all their other weapons are expected to take the field this Sunday.

#### _History / Analysis_

Denver actually made more of a commitment to the running game last week, finally. As a result, the Broncos were actually competitive last week, albeit against a Kansas team playing at less than 100%. A renewed focus on the ground game would serve the team well, considering the offense didn't show any real promise when Drew Lock's arm was its main vehicle.

The only common team these two organizations recently contested is Kansas City. Both fared better than expected, though Carolina was so much more impressive in its campaign to upset the reigning Super Bowl champs, as indicated by their time of possession.

***

Panthers -3

***

**Carolina covers if**  
Teddy Bridgewater and his weapons can wreck Denver's inexperienced secondary.  
\- OR -  
Denver's rushing attack never really develops, either because it's been stemmed by the Panthers or it's been abandoned by Pat Shurmur.

**Denver covers if  
**their defense can force at least 3 turnovers in this game. Denver also needs to try to win time of possession by committing more to their ground game. The run/pass ratio should be fairly close to 1, if not greater.

### Chiefs @ Dolphins (+7)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Broncos (16) @ **Chiefs** (22)  
Bengals (7) @ **Dolphins** (19)

#### _Record_

Chiefs (11-1)  
Dolphins (8-4)

#### _Weather_

Hot by December's standards.

#### _Injuries_

Chiefs are remarkably healthy, though they may be down the heart and soul of their defense in Tyrann Matthieu. Matthieu is the one defender in that backfield that can serve the swiss knife role a Spagnuolo defense needs to be truly effective.

Miami is in slightly shittier shape. The Dolphins will be down starting guard Ereck Flowers. More importantly, both Elandon Roberts and Kyle Van Noy may be ruled out Sunday. Both are important in keeping this Belichick-style defense functioning at a high level. Not to mention Van Noy is a significant presence in the pass rush.

#### _History / Analysis_

Brian Flores was on Belichick's coaching staff when him and his crew upset the Chiefs for an invite to the Super Bowl two years ago. Patrick Mahomes still racked up a bunch of points that game, but the fact remains he was nearly shut out the first half thanks to a combination of solid coverage and crafty blitzes. Ever since, Mahomes has struggled against Belichick's defensive schemes, even going back just a couple months ago when New England played the Chiefs in primetime.

Flores runs a very similar scheme with some of the same personnel from the Patriots championship run two years ago. Mahomes and Andy Reid have yet to fully counter that style of defense, though they do enough to notch the win.

The problem here for the Dolphins is that I wonder whether Tua Tagovailoa can actually carry the team in a big spot against one of the league's best organizations. Three weeks ago, the boy was completely exposed against Vic Fangio's defense. Spags may not have a defense as complex as Fangio's, but his unit features a package of blitzes known to frustrate young and unprepared quarterbacks. On top of that, Chris Jones is one of those players capable of wrecking quarterbacks like Tua with immediate pressure up the middle. Given that Denver practically neutered Tua with interior pressure, this should be another point of concern for the Dolphins.

***

Dolphins +7

***

**Miami covers if**  
their defense can prevent the Chiefs from posting points on a fair number of their drives and their offense is able to matriculate the ball on a majority of drives. In order for this offense to be productive, Miami needs to establish the ground game behind Myles Gaskin or work in some creative passing concepts that won't leave Tua exposed to Kansas City's pass rush. An early switch to Ryan Fitzpatrick would also be advisable.

**Kansas City covers if**  
their defense can fluster Tua in the same manner as Denver's defense. Should Ryan Fitzpatrick come into action here, the Kansas defense will need to find ways to force him into some ugly turnovers.

### Steelers @ Bills (-2.5)

#### _Latest Results_

**Football Team** (23) @ Steelers (17)  
**Bills** (34) vs. 49ers (24)

#### _Record_

Steelers (11-1)  
Bills (9-3)

#### _Weather_

Cold and maybe even a little wet. The field could possibly be slippery if rain comes down overnight. Throw some wind in there too.

#### _Injuries_

Pittsburgh's defense will be down some key pieces along their back seven. First corner Joe Haden will be out with a concussion. The more scary situation comes along their linebacking corps - Bud Dupree's replacement Robert Spillane has been ruled out. On top of that, Vince Williams remains sidelined with COVID. Therefore, Pittsburgh will be scraping the bottom of their depth chart to find bodies to play linebacker for them.

Buffalo is almost fully healthy coming into this match.

### Ravens @ Browns (+1)

#### _Latest Results_

Cowboys (17) @ **Ravens** (34)  
**Browns** (41) @ Titans (35)

#### _Record_

Ravens (7-5)  
Browns (9-3)

#### _Weather_

Seasonably cold.

#### _Injuries_

Browns could be missing the services of their main tight end in Austin Hooper. It's possible David Njoku could take over his production though for this game.

Ravens are in fairly decent shape, though it's possible Calais Campbell won't be suiting up for the game, as he hasn't practiced at all this week.
