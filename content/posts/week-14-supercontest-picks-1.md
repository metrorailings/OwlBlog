I still have a ways to go in my gambling journey. My Sunday was beyond phenomenal. All my picks were on point. It was amazing.

Then Monday came and threw me into a depression. Not only did the Steelers fail to cover, but they outright lost against Washington. Then San Francisco crashed and burned in what was supposed to be an emotional outing against the Bills.

As much as I hate saying this, both of those games were terrible picks on my part. The reality is that the Steelers haven't been good offensively for several weeks now. On top of that, their players been exhausted for the last couple weeks. Against a solid defense like Washington's, the team fell apart. As for the second game, Brian Daboll and Josh Allen have been too good this season. I suppose I was banking on Allen regressing back to the mean this game, but I was proven wrong. If anything, his performance convinced me that Allen has truly elevated his quarterbacking this year. It's no fluke.

Once again, a key rule of thumb here is to try and not go against good coaches unless the line gives you some serious flexibility. Good coaches usually dictate which side of the line will end up being correct.

#### _Latest Results_

**Saints** (21) @ Falcons (16)  
Eagles (16) @ **Packers** (30)

#### _Record_

Washington (4-7)  
Steelers (11-0)

#### _Injuries_

The Football Team is coming into this game as healthy as can be.

The Steelers on the other hand may have a few issues. Starting cornerback Steven Nelson is hamstrung. Two of their depth offensive linemen may also be ruled out after being exposed to COVID. Throw James Conner on that COVID list as well. Most important of all though, Bud Dupree will no longer be present on the field given his season-ending ACL injury. Not good at all for a Steelers defense that prided itself on its beastly pass rush.

#### _History / Analysis_

Alex Smith was hit on upwards of 60% of his passing attempts last week against the Cowboys last week. Enter the Steelers with their league-leading pass rush. Washington catches a little break here now that the Steelers will be down one of their best pass rushers without Dupree, but Pittsburgh still has three other players who can steadily harass opposing quarterbacks.

#### _Weather_

Clear and cold

Steelers -7.5

**Pittsburgh covers if**  
Coming off a poor performance against a wrecked Baltimore team, the Steelers overcompensate against a Washington organization lacking talent across the board.  
\- OR -  
Defensive pressure forces Alex Smith into way too many ugly moments.

**Washington covers if**  
Alex Smith balls out against the Steelers defense using mostly short passes. Also, their defense needs to force Ben Roethlisberger to hold on to the ball a tick longer than normal so that their front has enough time to harangue him.
