Last week was another solid week. My losses were both bad beats. The Giants would have covered if Daniel Jones didn't tweak his hamstring or the referees didn't gift the Bengals with so many free yards on a **bullshit** pass interference call on their last scoring drive. Likewise, the Seahawks were just _begging _the Eagles to back into the cover. Seattle was literally out there just waving Philadelphia into their end zone. But the Eagles are on a mission this year to achieves levels of incompetence never before achieved in mankind's history. And true to this aim, Philadelphia failed to book the cover.

Anyway, let's keep at it and keep cashing in these tickets.

### Football Team @ Steelers (-7.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Washington** (41) @ Cowboys (16)  
Ravens (14) @ **Steelers** (19)

#### _Record_

Washington (4-7)  
Steelers (11-0)

#### _Injuries_

The Football Team is coming into this game as healthy as can be.

The Steelers on the other hand may have a few issues. Starting cornerback Steven Nelson is hamstrung. Two of their depth offensive linemen may also be ruled out after being exposed to COVID. Throw James Conner on that COVID list as well. Most important of all though, Bud Dupree will no longer be present on the field given his season-ending ACL injury. Not good at all for a Steelers defense that prided itself on its beastly pass rush.

#### _History / Analysis_

Alex Smith was hit on upwards of 60% of his passing attempts last week against the Cowboys last week. Enter the Steelers with their league-leading pass rush. Washington catches a little break here now that the Steelers will be down one of their best pass rushers without Dupree, but Pittsburgh still has three other players who can steadily harass opposing quarterbacks.

#### _Weather_

Clear and cold

Steelers -7.5

**Pittsburgh covers if**  
Coming off a poor performance against a wrecked Baltimore team, the Steelers overcompensate against a Washington organization lacking talent across the board.  
\- OR -  
Defensive pressure forces Alex Smith into way too many ugly moments.

**Washington covers if**  
Alex Smith balls out against the Steelers defense using mostly short passes. Also, their defense needs to force Ben Roethlisberger to hold on to the ball a tick longer than normal so that their front has enough time to harangue him.
