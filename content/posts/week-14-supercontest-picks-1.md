I still have a ways to go in my gambling journey. My Sunday was beyond phenomenal. All my picks were on point. It was amazing.

Then Monday came and threw me into a depression. Not only did the Steelers fail to cover, but they outright lost against Washington. Then San Francisco crashed and burned in what was supposed to be an emotional outing against the Bills.

As much as I hate saying this, both of those games were terrible picks on my part. The reality is that the Steelers haven't been good offensively for several weeks now. On top of that, their players have been exhausted for the last couple weeks. Against a solid defense like Washington's, the team expectedly fell apart. As for the other game, Brian Daboll and Josh Allen have been too good this season. I suppose I was banking on Allen regressing back to the mean this game against an emotionally wrought San Francisco team, but I was proven wrong. If anything, his performance has me convinced now that his jump this year is no fluke.

Once again, a key rule of thumb here is to try and not go against good coaches unless the line gives you some serious flexibility. Good coaches usually dictate which side of the line will end up being correct.

**New Orleans covers if**  
their pass rushers can keep Jalen Hurts hemmed in the pocket. The Saints defensive linemen need to mount pressure mostly through bull rushes. It wouldn't be the first time this season New Orleans sustained a pass rush solely off bull rushes.

**Philadelphia covers if**  
Jalen Hurts actually ends up impressing against one of the league's best defenses. It's remotely possible if he's allowed to break from the pocket and run at will.
