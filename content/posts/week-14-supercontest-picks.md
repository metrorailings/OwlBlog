#### _Ravens_ @ Bills (+5.5)

The Bills' big win against Dallas may have been overblown, given Chicago's manhandling of the Cowboys last night.

But more important than that, the Bills still have a major problem guarding against the run. While they've improved a little over the past few weeks, it's a problem that's going to linger for the whole season. And that weakness will be exposed in the worst possible way against a Ravens team that can run the ball a myriad of ways.

#### 49ers @ _Saints_ (-2.5)

The 49ers and their defensive line concern me a bit, especially given the injuries along the Saints offensive front. Still though...from what I saw when the Cardinals played San Francisco twice this season, this 49ers defense can be picked apart with short passes and some creative play calling.  Fortunately for the home team here, short passes and imaginative plays are the two central pillars of their offense.

So long as Brees can rid himself of the ball before the 49ers pass rushers start invading his personal space, New Orleans has a good shot at the cover here.

#### Chiefs @ _Patriots_ (-3)

The Patriots looked horrendous last week in their loss against the Texans. And it's hard for me to envision somebody like Bill Belichick tolerating yet another bad performance from his team this week.

Still, even a good day on offense for these Patriots wouldn't be enough to secure them the win here and the possible cover here. No, what New England needs to do is dominate these Chiefs in the ground game. So long as the Patriots possess the ball here and keep Mahomes snaps to a minimal number, New England can outright win in dominating fashion. And that's possible given Kansas is absolute ass in defensing the run. 

And even if the Patriots do give up the ball pretty quickly on a few drives, I would hope New England's solid defensive backfield will be able to stunt the Chiefs and their big play offense on more than just a few occasions.

#### Steelers @ _Cardinals_ (+2.5)

My faith in the Duckster last week paid off. But in the process, I lost some faith in him - his big plays are hit or miss. Thankfully, most of his plays last week were more successful than not. But then again, Pittsburgh had a reason to play ever harder than usual, given the way their first match against Cleveland ended. This week, that same motivation isn't there. And it should make things a tad bit easier for Kyler Murray as he and his Cardinals settle back into the thick of things after an embarrassing loss against the Rams last week.

Pittsburgh's defense does give up pass yardage.  And Arizona can throw the ball if necessary here. In this rebound spot, give me Arizona.

#### _Seahawks_ @ Rams (PK)

I do respect the Rams, but give me the MVP-caliber quarterback here over a quarterback way out of his groove this season. Still, it does worry me that the Seahawks defense chokes up lots of yardage to opposing offenses. Out of all my picks, I see this being the riskiest - if Seattle gives the Rams offense enough time to settle into a rhythm, expect a back-and-forth affair here.

Still, I'll take my chances with Russell Wilson over Jared Goff and a cooling Rams team any day of the week.
