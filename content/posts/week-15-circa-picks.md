Dammit, another 3-2 week. So frustrating. And the two picks I messed up were difficult for me to avoid. I thought Arizona truly changed its colors this season and had some magic to help them carry them through tough moments. Nope, that's not the case. Take away the running game and forcing Kyler to play from the pocket is the best way to kneecap their explosive offense, especially when their best skill player is injured. Washington was just as tough a decision to avoid for me - Taylor Heinecke's success is predicated on having enough time in the pocket. But with DeMarcus Laurence, Randy Gregory, and Micah Parsons back, Heinecke had no time to settle into a groove.

So here we are. I think the one lesson is be wary of division games. It's a lesson that I have to teach myself time and time again. Unfortunately, so many of the games this week are division games...painful. Well...here we go.
