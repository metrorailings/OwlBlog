Dammit, another 3-2 week. So frustrating. And the two picks I messed up were difficult for me to avoid. I thought Arizona truly changed its colors this season and had some magic to help them carry them through tough moments. Nope, that's not the case. Take away the running game and forcing Kyler to play from the pocket is the best way to kneecap their explosive offense, especially when their best skill player is injured. Washington was just as tough a decision to avoid for me - Taylor Heinecke's success is predicated on having enough time in the pocket. But with DeMarcus Laurence, Randy Gregory, and Micah Parsons back, Heinecke had no time to settle into a groove.

So here we are. I think the one lesson is be wary of division games. It's a lesson that I have to teach myself time and time again. Unfortunately, so many of the games this week are division games...painful. Well...here we go.

### Panthers @ Bills (-10.5)

**_Falcons_** @ Panthers  
Bills @ **_Buccaneers_**

#### _Key Injuries_

Carolina's remarkably healthy late into the season, though it doesn't seem to matter much.

For the Bills, Tre'Davious White is guaranteed to miss the rest of the season following ACL repair surgery. But against the Panthers, the more worrying injury is to Josh Allen. If Allen can't really run much or even handle the Panthers pass rush, Buffalo will have to turn to MVP Mitch Trubisky to handle the reins. Lord help them.

#### _History_

No relevant history. Buffalo's offensive line has been a train wreck lately, but Carolina's own unit has been arguably worse. It's a battle between two teams with major protection issues.

#### _Weather_

A little windy and wet on an otherwise cold day

Bills -10.5

**Buffalo covers if**  
their defense forces at least three turnovers from a Carolina team playing behind a duo of shaky quarterbacks.

**Carolina covers if**  
their offense loses the ball twice at most and their ground game gets rolling against Buffalo's smaller defensive front.

### Washington @ Eagles (-9)

#### _Latest Results_

**_Cowboys_** @ Washington  
**_Eagles_** @ Jets \[BYE\]

#### _Key Injuries_

Washington is devastated right now by the COVID bug. A whole bunch of starters along their offensive and defensive lines will almost certainly not see any action on the field this Sunday as a result of COVID. Honestly, the biggest losses may be stud defensive tackle Jonathan Allen and back-up quarterback Kyle Allen. On top of that, Terry McLaurin and JD McKissic are dealing with concussions. Even though McLaurin has been practicing, concussions normally keep players sidelined for at least one week, so expect McLaurin not to play. In addition, Taylor Heinecke coping with leg injuries of his own, which may effect his mobility against a fierce Philadelphia pass rush.

Philadelphia has come off the bye mostly healthy. While the organization keeps listing Jalen Hurts on the injury report, he should be fine.

#### _History_

The last time these two teams danced, Philadelphia was in position to win before Doug Pederson conscientiously benched players to guarantee a loss (in a bid to better Philadelphia's draft position). And this was against a surging Washington defense too. That game only holds so much comparative value though, given Philadelphia's entire coaching regime has been overhauled since then. In all fairness, Philadelphia has looked better this year under the stewardship of Nick Sirianni and Jonathan Gannon while Washington has looked the same, more or less.

#### _Weather_

A little windy and cold

Eagles -9

**Philadelphia covers if**  
COVID strips Washington of so much potential  
\- AND -  
Washington's offensive coaches continue insisting that Heinecke hold the ball, even against this voracious Eagle front. It seems so much of Washington's offensive philosophy is predicated off skill players running combination routes out of either empty sets or one-back sets, which doesn't do much to help out their mediocre offensive line.

**Washington covers if**  
Philadelphia is caught snoozing against what should be a sleepwalk victory.

### Falcons @ 49ers (-9)

#### _Latest Results_

**_Falcons _**@ Panthers  
**_49ers_** @ Bengals

#### _Key Injuries_

No major injury of consequence for the Falcons.

For the 49ers, Deebo is now fully healthy, a sure bit of welcome news for a team that definitely needs the services of its best player on offense to fight their way into the postseason. But their linebacking situation is concerning, considering their two best linebackers are dealing with injuries. Only Fred Warner seems like he'll be able to suit up this Sunday.

#### _History_

Two years ago, Matt Ryan and his crew won against Shanahan and Garoppalo's 49ers as near double-digit underdogs. A few things have changed over the course of two seasons. Atlanta introduced a new coaching regime this year. San Francisco has a few new weapons. DeMeco Ryans has replaced Robert Saleh as the franchise's new defensive coordinator.

#### _Weather_

Cold and humid. Not the seasonal San Francisco weather we're used to here.

49ers -9

**San Francisco covers if**  
their offensive line can stonewall Atlanta and all of their exotic blitzes.

**Atlanta covers if**  
their defense can step up and frustrate San Francisco's up-and-down offense.
