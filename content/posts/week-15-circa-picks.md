Dammit, another 3-2 week. So frustrating. And the two picks I messed up were difficult for me to avoid. I thought Arizona truly changed its colors this season and had some magic to help them carry them through tough moments. Nope, that's not the case. Take away the running game and forcing Kyler to play from the pocket is the best way to kneecap their explosive offense, especially when their best skill player is injured. Washington was just as tough a decision to avoid for me - Taylor Heinecke's success is predicated on having enough time in the pocket. But with DeMarcus Laurence, Randy Gregory, and Micah Parsons back, Heinecke had no time to settle into a groove.

So here we are. I think the one lesson is be wary of division games. It's a lesson that I have to teach myself time and time again. Unfortunately, so many of the games this week are division games...painful. Well...here we go.

### Panthers @ Bills (-10.5)

#### _Latest Results_

**_Falcons_** @ Panthers  
Bills @ **_Buccaneers_**

#### _Key Injuries_

Carolina's remarkably healthy late into the season, though it doesn't seem to matter much.

For the Bills, Tre'Davious White is guaranteed to miss the rest of the season following ACL repair surgery. But against the Panthers, the more worrying injury is to Josh Allen. If Allen can't really run much or even handle the Panthers pass rush, Buffalo will have to turn to MVP Mitch Trubisky to handle the reins. Lord help them.

#### _History_

No relevant history. Buffalo's offensive line has been a train wreck lately, but Carolina's own unit has been arguably worse. It's a battle between two teams with major protection issues.

#### _Weather_

A little windy and wet on an otherwise cold day

Bills -10.5

**Buffalo covers if**  
their defense forces at least three turnovers from a Carolina team playing behind a duo of shaky quarterbacks.

**Carolina covers if**  
their offense loses the ball twice at most and their ground game gets rolling against Buffalo's smaller defensive front.
