I'm done. I'm out. Last week was my absolute last attempt at making a comeback towards respectability and I shat the bed. I mean, I _shat_ the bed. My excrement was so disgusting that it soaked through the entire mattress and even ruined the carpet underneath.  I only logged one game correctly last week. My other four picks crashed and burned.

Are there lessons here? Sure, three lesson in particular. One, don't pick teams starting injured quarterbacks. Daniel Jones wasn't able to run nor be graceful with his footwork in the pocket. It threw off his entire game and effectively doomed the offense to mediocrity. Two, stay away from teams coming off byes. It's become clear to me teams two weeks removed from game action need some time to properly reset, holistically speaking. Unfortunately, the time it takes to ramp up to form gives the other team too much opportunity to find a rhythm and potentially build a lead.

Lastly (and perhaps the most brutal lesson I took from the week), coaches can't always be trusted to do the right thing. Not sure why it took me so long to figure this out, but even professional coaches can fall victim to egregious oversights. Dennis Allen and the Saints were legitimately taken back when they found out that Jalen Hurts **_loves_** to run the ball, even though his play in the Green Bay game the week before illustrated that fact in a pretty glaring way. Likewise, the Browns made a pointed effort to guard the Ravens as if Lamar Jackson was an elite passer. I don't know why Joe Woods thought a mobile quarterback like Lamar would be shook by man coverage and light boxes. Woods reckless coaching gave Lamar freedom to work the ground game. And once Lamar starts accruing serious mileage with his feet, his confidence grows in spades. So it shouldn't have been much a surprise that he was able to will his team forward for the win towards the end of the game.

Really, identity and drive are key to banking on whether a team can plan properly for their next opponent. Some teams are built in such a way that they can't help but expose the weaknesses of some of their opponents. These teams are usually a good bet. Just as well, if the team has any real drive or motivation to do well against an opponent, a good game plan is so much more likely to be drafted.

Anyway, time for more laughable picks.

### Bills @ Broncos (+6)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Steelers (15) @ **Bills** (26)  
**Broncos** (32) @ Panthers (27)

#### _Record_

Bills (10-3)  
Broncos (5-8)

#### _Weather_

Little chilly

#### _Injuries_

Broncos are even a bigger disaster in the secondary this week compared to last. Three starting cornerbacks are essentially out for the season and two more were lost over the last week. Denver is now just working with three cornerbacks on their roster. Things may not work out so well against a Bills passing attack that's among one of the best in the league. Also worth noting, the Broncos will be without their kicker, Brandon McManus.

Buffalo's pretty damn healthy coming into the game.

#### _History / Analysis_

Not sure if history has much to say here given the circumstances. Denver's defense has been solid this year, but their situation at cornerback leaves them with a festering wound. The Panthers weren't able to expose their gashed backfield as much as I expected last week, mostly because Carolina was still waking up after a restful bye. But Josh Allen and his weapons should ideally have a field day going up against a barebones secondary.

But not all is off for the Broncos here. Buffalo's defense has struggled to manage opposing rushers this season. Denver's shown more of a willingness to run the ball the past couple games, so if they stick with their ground game here, the Broncos could keep this game in contention by winning time of possession.

Bills -6

***

**Buffalo will cover if**  
their passing game pops off going against an incredibly weakened Denver secondary.

**Denver will cover if**  
the offense can dominate time of possession by establishing the ground game.  
\- OR -  
Drew Lock rallies in garbage time for the backdoor cover.

### Panthers @ Packers (-8)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Broncos** (32) @ Panthers (27)  
**Packers** (31) @ Lions (24)

#### _Record_

Panthers (4-9)  
Packers (10-3)

#### _Weather_

Quite cold

#### _Injuries_

Panthers will likely down their starting left tackle in Russell Okung.

Packers will be relatively healthy going into the third week of December.

#### _History / Analysis_

The most recent common opponent these two teams have faced has been Detroit - the Panthers looked more impressive in their win over the Lions. Only so much stock can be put into this line of reasoning though given the Panthers were starting a back-up quarterback.

Really, Green Bay's success this season has come courtesy of its offense. Rodgers and LaFleur have found a happy point in the middle with their  approach on offense, resulting in one of the league's most productive units this year on that side of the ball. The defense hasn't improved at all though - it still remains notably weak against the run and the short passing game. And unfortunately for the Packers, both of those things are points of pride for the Panthers.

Still, Rodgers and company should be able to eat against a soft Panthers defense known for giving up boatloads of yardage to good passing offenses.

Panthers +8

***

**Carolina covers if**  
the Panthers show their sad outing last week was an outlier. So long as Teddy Bridgewater and his cohorts on offense can minimize the silly mistakes and play with some passion, the cover is definitely within reach.  
\- OR -  
the Packers take a dominant lead early enough in the game and take their foot off the gas pedal going into the fourth quarter, allowing the Panthers to tally up enough points in garbage time to beat the spread.

**Green Bay covers if**  
Carolina's mistakes carry over from last week. The Packers also need to run up the score against a pretty pathetic Panthers pass coverage unit.

### Buccaneers @ Falcons (+6)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Vikings (14) @ **Buccaneers** (26)  
Falcons (17) @ **Chargers** (20)

#### _Results_

Buccaneers (8-5)  
Falcons (4-9)

#### _Injuries_

Tampa Bay is likely going to take the field without starting corner Jamel Dean, left tackle Donovan Smith, and starting tailback Ronald Jones. Neither player will likely impact the team much on-field.

Atlanta will be missing the services of their best wide receiver in Julio Jones. On top of that, two of the starters in the defensive backfield will be sidelined as well.

#### _History / Analysis_

It's the first meeting between these two this season. So while we don't have any past contest to draw some conclusions from here, the reality is that we have quite a bit of tape on Tampa Bay's offense in its first year with Brady at the helm. First thing of note, Brady remains as susceptible as ever to pressure, especially in his old age. Given the state of the Buccaneers offensive line, throws under duress has been a common theme for Tampa Bay's passing attack this season. But more importantly of note, Brady and Arians have yet to fully mesh on offense. Their philosophies and tendencies are way too different. Brady prefers surgical throws down the middle of the field. Arians wants to go out with guns blazing.

On the other hand, Atlanta has actually been getting better under Raheem Morris as interim coach. Their pass rush has taken a step up, thanks in part to an increased willingness to blitz quarterbacks with their speedier backfield players. Their coverage defenders have also played better, notably in man coverage. The offense has shown flashes of quality play, though Matt Ryan can be as erratic as ever sometimes. And that's where Tampa Bay could seize the advantage here...

***

Falcons +6

***

**Atlanta covers if**  
the intensity with which they'e been playing football as of late carries over and frustrates a Tampa Bay team lacking identity on offense.  
\- OR -  
their pass rush can stymie any momentum Tampa Bay develops in the passing game.

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
their blitz packages and pass rushers can force Matt Ryan to play like a man a few weeks away from retiring.

### Seahawks @ Washington (+5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Jets (3) @ **Seahawks** (40)  
**Washington** (23) @ 49ers (15)

#### _Record_

Seahawks (9-4)  
Washington (6-7)

#### _Weather_

Cold weather. Possibly wet field from some light rain earlier in the morning.

#### _Injuries_

The right side of Seattle's offensive line still remains problematic, as two pieces of the offense that normally work the right tackle position may be out.

Washington will be unfortunately forced to field Dwayne Haskins as their starter at quarterback. It'll be a painful game.

#### _History / Analysis_

History doesn't favor either team going into this match-up. The Rams and the Giants have proven that solid defenses can keep Seattle's offense in chains. Washington's defense should be able to follow suit. 

The problem with Washington is their offense. Their offense was horrid enough as is with Alex Smith at the helm. But things go even further south with Dwayne Haskins directing that unit now that Alex Smith is sidelined. If Washington is to decisively take control of this game, the defense will need to put the entire team on its back.

***

Washington +5

***

**Washington covers if**  
their defense can snuff out Seattle's offense from start to finish and their offense can record at least one touchdown and two field goals.

**Seattle covers if**  
Dwayne Haskins plays like a goddamn moron yet again.
