I'm done. I'm out. Last week was my absolute last attempt at making a comeback towards respectability and I shat the bed. I mean, I _shat_ the bed. My excrement was so disgusting that it soaked through the entire mattress and even ruined the carpet underneath.  I only logged one game correctly last week. My other four picks crashed and burned.

Are there lessons here? Sure, three lesson in particular. One, don't pick teams starting injured quarterbacks. Daniel Jones wasn't able to run nor be graceful with his footwork in the pocket. It threw off his entire game and effectively doomed the offense to mediocrity. Two, stay away from teams coming off byes. It's become clear to me teams two weeks removed from game action need some time to properly reset, holistically speaking. Unfortunately, the time it takes to ramp up to form gives the other team too much opportunity to find a rhythm and potentially build a lead.
