I'm done. I'm out. Last week was my absolute last attempt at making a comeback towards respectability and I shat the bed. I mean, I _shat_ the bed. My excrement was so disgusting that it soaked through the entire mattress and even ruined the carpet underneath.  I only logged one game correctly last week. My other four picks crashed and burned.

Are there lessons here? Sure, three lesson in particular. One, don't pick teams starting injured quarterbacks. Daniel Jones wasn't able to run nor be graceful with his footwork in the pocket. It threw off his entire game and effectively doomed the offense to mediocrity. Two, stay away from teams coming off byes. It's become clear to me teams two weeks removed from game action need some time to properly reset, holistically speaking. Unfortunately, the time it takes to ramp up to form gives the other team too much opportunity to find a rhythm and potentially build a lead.

Lastly (and perhaps the most brutal lesson I took from the week), coaches can't always be trusted to do the right thing. Not sure why it took me so long to figure this out, but even professional coaches can fall victim to egregious oversights. Dennis Allen and the Saints were legitimately taken back when they found out that Jalen Hurts **_loves_** to run the ball, even though his play in the Green Bay game the week before illustrated that fact in a pretty glaring way. Likewise, the Browns made a pointed effort to guard the Ravens as if Lamar Jackson was an elite passer. I don't know why Joe Woods thought a mobile quarterback like Lamar would be shook by man coverage and light boxes. Woods reckless coaching gave Lamar freedom to work the ground game. And once Lamar starts accruing serious mileage with his feet, his confidence grows in spades. So it shouldn't have been much a surprise that he was able to will his team forward for the win towards the end of the game.

Really, identity and drive are key to banking on whether a team can plan properly for their next opponent. Some teams are built in such a way that they can't help but expose the weaknesses of some of their opponents. These teams are usually a good bet. Just as well, if the team has any real drive or motivation to do well against an opponent, a good game plan is so much more likely to be drafted.

Anyway, time for more laughable picks.

#### _Injuries_

Broncos are even a bigger disaster in the secondary this week compared to last. Three starting cornerbacks are essentially out for the season and two more were lost over the last week. Denver is now just working with three cornerbacks on their roster. Things may not work out so well against a Bills passing attack that's among one of the best in the league. Also worth noting, the Broncos will be without their kicker, Brandon McManus.
