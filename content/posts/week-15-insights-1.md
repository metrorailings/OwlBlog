## Chiefs @ Chargers

Jerry Tillery and Uchena Nwosu are names to watch on this defensive line. Both have made plays, the former cutting a run short from the 1-yard line and the other with an incredibly athletic interception.

Why is Staley calling man coverage against the Chiefs? Kansas tied the game in the fourth quarter because Travis Kelce was able to shed his defender and run wild for 69 yards. 

As much as I downplay Keenan Allen, I'm thinking Keenan Allen may truly be a vector on offense.

Brandon Staley's defense takes too many chances for my liking. Playing man coverage every now and then, not maintaining gap integrity in their pass rush...it's costing them points. Where's the discipline and the consistency?
