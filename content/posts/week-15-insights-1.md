## Chiefs @ Chargers

Jerry Tillery and Uchena Nwosu are names to watch on this defensive line. Both have made plays, the former cutting a run short from the 1-yard line and the other with an incredibly athletic interception.

Why is Staley calling man coverage against the Chiefs? Kansas tied the game in the fourth quarter because Travis Kelce was able to shed his defender and run wild for 69 yards.

As much as I downplay Keenan Allen, I'm thinking Keenan Allen may truly be a vector on offense.

Brandon Staley's defense takes too many chances for my liking. Playing man coverage every now and then, not maintaining gap integrity in their pass rush...it's costing them points. Where's the discipline and the consistency?

Spagnuolo's defense is getting it done though. Actually managed to stop the Chargers on a hurry-up drive. The defense was playing pretty soundly in both coverage and pass rush.

The Chargers lost this one because of Staley. Staley gambled too much with man coverage and risky pass rushes. The defense had one job - limit both Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill. They achieved neither. Both managed to eat against a Los Angeles defense that allegedly values pass coverage.

## Patriots @ Colts

Jacoby Meyers, Kendrick Bourne, and Damien Harris are the skill players standing out on this Patriots offense. Whether all three of them can merit vector status remains to be seen.

New England's offensive line never fails to impress me. They've held up remarkably well in pass protection, the only major breakdown being a sack from DeForest Buckner.

The Carson Wentz experiment has been a dismal failure. Shame.

I think Hunter Henry is a vector on offense. New England's two touchdowns have come via him and Mac Jones being on the same page.

## Cowboys @ Giants

Once again, the Cowboys with their pass rush have been stifling. 

Giants have found life in their offense behind Saquon and Booker. 

Solid use of skill personnel from Kellen Moore to open up men around the field. On one third down, Moore had Elliott line up as a fullback with CeeDee Lamb as the tailback. It was interesting enough to trip up the Giant defense.

Tony Pollard may be a vector for this Dallas offense. Zeke just isn't the same force he was when he started out. 

Dak has been serviceable, but elite? Nah. Demarcus Laurence on the other hand, has been pretty damn good.
