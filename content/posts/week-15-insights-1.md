## Chiefs @ Chargers

Jerry Tillery and Uchena Nwosu are names to watch on this defensive line. Both have made plays, the former cutting a run short from the 1-yard line and the other with an incredibly athletic interception.

Why is Staley calling man coverage against the Chiefs? Kansas tied the game in the fourth quarter because Travis Kelce was able to shed his defender and run wild for 69 yards. 

As much as I downplay Keenan Allen, I'm thinking Keenan Allen may truly be a vector on offense.

Brandon Staley's defense takes too many chances for my liking. Playing man coverage every now and then, not maintaining gap integrity in their pass rush...it's costing them points. Where's the discipline and the consistency? 

Spagnuolo's defense is getting it done though. Actually managed to stop the Chargers on a hurry-up drive. The defense was playing pretty soundly in both coverage and pass rush.

The Chargers lost this one because of Staley. Staley gambled too much with man coverage and risky pass rushes. The defense had one job - limit both Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill. They achieved neither. Both managed to eat against a Los Angeles defense that allegedly values pass coverage.
