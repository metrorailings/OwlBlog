## Chiefs @ Saints

Brees playing awful so far, but a quick snap completely threw the Chiefs defense off and set up a big play for a goal-to-go series.

Kansas is actually running the football with some gusto. Not sure what happened to New Orleans and their vaunted run defense. Is it likely the Saints are selling out and assuming every play to be a pass?

New Orleans had a productive drive based off play action and solid pass protection giving Brees plenty of time in the pocket. Also some luck, as Brees was off on a few throws that could have been picked.

It seems like Kansas City's defenders are actually holding up well in man coverage.

Drew Brees is way off. Sure, his receivers situation isn't ideal, but his throws aren't impressive at all. He's not even giving his receivers a chance for a contested catch.

## Browns @ Giants

Got to love how short Mayfield is. He always has one or two passes batted down a game.

## Steelers @ Bengals

Pittsburgh is about to muster a comeback after being down 17 points. Not bad.

Steelers are really trying hard to work Diontae Johnson into their offense. Diontae can be a successor to Antonio Brown if he's able to overcome his severe anxiety.

Quarterback runs have bedeviled the Steelers defense.

## Seahawks @ Washington

Washington has a fantastic defensive line, but only decent pass coverage. I notice too many lapses in pass coverage, either among the linebackers or the secondary. Cover-three in particular can really expose this team.

Outside runs also seem to frustrate Washington's defensive front.
