## Chiefs @ Saints

Brees playing awful so far, but a quick snap completely threw the Chiefs defense off and set up a big play for a goal-to-go series.

Kansas is actually running the football with some gusto. Not sure what happened to New Orleans and their vaunted run defense. Is it likely the Saints are selling out and assuming every play to be a pass?

New Orleans had a productive drive based off play action and solid pass protection giving Brees plenty of time in the pocket.
