## Buccaneers @ Lions

Josh Wells a liability as a replacement left tackle for Tampa Bay.

Detroit Lions actually blitzed for once and managed to secure an interception off that blitz.

The Lions are so bad in their defensive backfield, I love it.

## Bears @ Packers

The Packers truly have one of the best offensive lines in the league. Their pass-blocking and run-blocking has been stellar this week and last week. 

Great throw by Aaron Rodgers for the team's first touchdown, though the jury is still out on whether he can still be considered an elite quarterback this season.
