## Buccaneers @ Lions

Josh Wells a liability as a replacement left tackle for Tampa Bay.

Detroit Lions actually blitzed for once and managed to secure an interception off that blitz.

The Lions are so bad in their defensive backfield, I love it.

## Bears @ Packers

The Packers truly have one of the best offensive lines in the league. Their pass-blocking and run-blocking has been stellar this week and last week. 

Great throw by Aaron Rodgers for the team's first touchdown, though the jury is still out on whether he can still be considered an elite quarterback this season.

## Seahawks @ Panthers

The Seahawks game plan is fairly simple here. Power runs with bootleg play-fakes peppered into the offense every now and then. 

But the Panthers are playing the run fairly well. Maybe yet more proof that it's easier for a bad defense to guard against good rushers than it is for a good offense to rush the ball against a bad defense.

These Seahawks skill players seem a tad bit slow. Even Tyler Lockett, who made a great move to shake off a trailing defender, only to be stopped just a few yards later.

## Rams @ Cowboys

Of course the Cowboys are developing a rhythm on offense, courtesy of their offensive line dominating the Rams defensive front in the ground game. The Rams are having a real hard time bringing Elliott down quickly.

Aaron Donald may be the only elite defensive linemen on the Rams, considering none of the other lineman are having much of an impact at defensing the run.

Maybe the lesson here is that the Rams play abnormally well against division opponents. Their true worth can only be measured against teams they do not play often.

Once again, Goff is trash playing dropback football. The Rams need him to settle into a rhythm for the offense to see any success.

## Bills @ Steelers

Josh Allen loves holding his balls.

Bold coaching by Sean McDermott paying off with a touchdown.

Nobody on the Bills defensive line really standing out, though Shaq Lawson looks to have potential.

McDermott loves checking out pre-snap formations and then taking timeouts, if only to gain even more intel on the opponent.
