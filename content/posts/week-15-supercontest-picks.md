#### _Buccaneers_ @ Lions (+3)

It's hard for me to trust Jameis here, especially given that he's without his favorite weapon in Mike Evans. Still, Jameis did all right last week when Evans had to leave early.  Things would have been much better if he didn't throw three ugly interceptions against the Colts and their zone defense.

It helps that the Lions almost exclusively play man coverage here, as it limits opportunities for interceptions. And even if interceptions are made, return yardage will be kept to a minimum.

If Jameis has enough opportunities, he'll sling the ball all over this Lions defense and secure a good win here.

#### _Texans_ @ Titans (-3)

The Titans have been rolling lately, whereas the Texans lost ugly to a Denver team starting a rookie quarterback. But that's the thing...rookie quarterbacks have the surprise factor going for them in that there's so little footage on them. That and the Broncos have a solid cast of playmakers on offense that a young quarterback can rely on for help.

Then again, does it even matter? O'Brien just had one of the biggest wins in his career. Could he really bring himself to give a damn about a team that was more than a touchdown underdog? Doubtful. So mix this apathy from the Texans coaching staff with the uncertainty that comes when a rookie quarterback starts games and you had the recipe for a sick upset.

In other words, the Texans are nowhere near as bad as their loss last week. Houston can still throw and run the ball fairly well. And both of those will help keep them in contention here against a Titans defense that's more middling than I originally thought.
