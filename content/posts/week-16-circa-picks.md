Last week was an odd week. I could have been 5-0. The Titans and Packers  were well on their way to covering going into the fourth quarter. And yet both teams blew up towards the tail end of things. The Titans were all too giddy turning the ball over on drives they had to close. Meanwhile, the Packers defense checked back into their hotel rooms halfway into the fourth quarter.
