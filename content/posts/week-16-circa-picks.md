+++
Last week was an odd week. I could have been 5-0. The Titans and Packers  were well on their way to covering going into the fourth quarter. And yet both teams blew up towards the tail end of things. The Titans were all too giddy turning the ball over on drives that they should have been able to close out given the success of their ground game. Meanwhile, the Packers defense checked back into their hotel rooms halfway through the fourth quarter. It was sad. Though to be fair, I was also lucky with Buffalo managing to cover against a Carolina team missing a punter.

And so here we are, week 16. The contest is all but over for me. Unless I completely run the table (highly unlikely), I'll be placing somewhere outside the money. Not good. But lessons were learned. Quite a few lessons actually. After the season ends, I'll need to create a document detailing my thoughts on the coaches around the league. The way these coaches operate and the way their teams play against other organizations perceivably inferior to them needs to be documented, as their management dictates the outcome of so many games.

Anyway, let's go ahead and finish out the season on a positive note.

#### _Latest Results_

**Packers** @ _Ravens_  
**Raiders** @ _Browns_

#### _Key Injuries_

Green Bay survived its trip to Baltimore mostly unscathed, despite the close finish. As we get closer to game day, we'll need to see whether the Packers will put any key players on injury watch.

Cleveland's biggest issue is COVID. By the time Saturday comes around, either Baker Mayfield or Case Keenum should be healthy. On top of that, a number of other players will be returning as well. It'll be paramount to check their injury report as the week progresses.

#### _History_

Neither of these two have much history together. Both offenses run  schemes and concepts predicated off Mike Shanahan's style of offensive football, so _theoretically_, their defenses should be able to hone in on some of the tricks both offenses will be pulling come Saturday.

#### _Weather_

Chilly, with some rain expected

Undecided

**Green Bay covers if**  
Cleveland's offense proves hopeless against a defense that's played at a high level sporadically this season. The Browns cannot be allowed to mount any sort of comeback late in the game once the Packers have a sizable lead  
\- AND -  
Baker Mayfield is starting at quarterback.

**Cleveland covers if**  
they can score touchdowns against a Green Bay defense known to soften  once the game winds down. It's imperative for Cleveland to establish some sort of ground game here behind Nick Chubb. The burden of production cannot rest solely in Baker Mayfield's hands  
\- OR -  
Baker is still dealing with COVID, forcing Case Keenum to start at quarterback. Unlike Mayfield, Keenum may actually connect with other skill players beyond Jarvis Landry.

### Colts @ Cardinals (-1)

#### _Latest Results_

Patriots @ **_Colts_** (Saturday Night Football)  
Cardinals @ **_Lions_**

#### _Key Injuries_

The Colts left the contest against the Patriots fairly healthy, though an eye should be kept on their offensive linemen.

Jordan Phillips may miss some time after leaving last Sunday's game against the Lions with an injury.

Doesn't matter much, as this is a dome game
