Last week was an odd week. I could have been 5-0. The Titans and Packers  were well on their way to covering going into the fourth quarter. And yet both teams blew up towards the tail end of things. The Titans were all too giddy turning the ball over on drives that they should have been able to close out given the success of their ground game. Meanwhile, the Packers defense checked back into their hotel rooms halfway through the fourth quarter. It was sad. Though to be fair, I was also lucky with Buffalo managing to cover against a Carolina team missing a punter.

And so here we are, week 16. The contest is all but over for me. Unless I completely run the table (highly unlikely), I'll be placing somewhere outside the money. Not good. But lessons were learned. Quite a few lessons actually. After the season ends, I'll need to create a document detailing my thoughts on the coaches around the league. The way these coaches operate and the way their teams play against other organizations perceivably inferior to them needs to be documented, as their management dictates the outcome of so many games.

Anyway, let's go ahead and finish out the season on a positive note.
