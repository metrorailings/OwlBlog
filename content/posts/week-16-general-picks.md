Another week, another set of picks. Note that I won't be as intense these last couple weeks of the regular season. For one thing, I'm done with the SuperContest. This year was yet another failed try at placing in the contest. I learned quite a bit nonetheless. It's just a matter of waiting for that one year where all these lessons do seriously pay off - hopefully I won't be waiting too long.

More importantly, I'll be devoting much less time to my weekly picks as I'm doing some research for the playoffs. Predicting the postseason remains yet another major goal of mine, one that I know is within reach this year. 

That being said, I have two major plays this week, both involving playoff-bound teams. So let's go.

Cool weather

#### _Injuries_

Broncos are even a bigger disaster in the secondary this week compared to last. Three starting cornerbacks are essentially out for the season and two more were lost over the last week. Denver is now just working with three cornerbacks on their roster. Things may not work out so well against a Bills passing attack that's among one of the best in the league. Also worth noting, the Broncos will be without their kicker, Brandon McManus.

Buffalo's pretty damn healthy coming into the game.
