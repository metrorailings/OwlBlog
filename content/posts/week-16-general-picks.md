+++
Another week, another set of picks. Note that I won't be as intense these last couple weeks of the regular season. For one thing, I'm done with the SuperContest. This year was yet another failed try at placing in the contest. I learned quite a bit nonetheless. It's just a matter of waiting for that one year where all these lessons do seriously pay off - hopefully I won't be waiting too long.

More importantly, I'll be devoting much less time to my weekly picks as I'm doing some research for the playoffs. Predicting the postseason remains yet another major goal of mine, one that I know is within reach this year. 

That being said, I have two major games to analyze this week, both involving playoff-bound teams. So let's go.

### Rams @ Seahawks (-2.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Jets** (23) @ Rams (20)  
**Seahawks** (20) @ Washington (15)

#### _Record_

Rams (9-5)  
Seahawks (10-4)

#### _Weather_

Cool weather

#### _Injuries_

Other than losing a starting linebacker for the rest of the season, the Rams are pretty healthy, though they'll be missing their starting running back, Cam Akers.

Seattle's pretty healthy, though some of their offensive linemen may still be nursing some injuries, regardless of when they end up playing.

#### _History / Analysis_

The first time these two teams met, the Rams defense won the game singlehandedly, turning over Russell Wilson multiple times. Ever since then, Seattle's pass rush has upped its level of play - the arrival of Carlos Dunlap and Jamal Adams returning to form has been key in the resurgence there. Their performance this Sunday will largely dictate who wins.

One thing to note though, the Rams have had Seattle's number going back to last year. And I suppose that makes sense, as the Seahawks defense hasn't been impressive at all this season. They've been getting fat the past month against soft offenses. A bitter Rams team coming off a horrendous loss should be a real test

No pick

**Los Angeles will cover if**  
the Rams can play with some passion coming off a bad loss to the formerly winless Jets. Their defense also needs to commit wholeheartedly to containing Russell Wilson in the pocket. Wilson's mobility gives Seattle a reliable vector of offense should DK Metcalf not be a viable option in the passing game. If Seattle is to win, it's because Wilson nailed them on some big plays. 

**Seattle will cover if**  
their pass rushers can harangue Jared Goff consistently. Goff falls apart whenever pressure is constantly blasted in his face.  
\- OR -  
Seattle chews off significant yardage on the ground against the Rams defense and their light boxes.

### Titans @ Packers (-3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Lions (25) @ **Titans** (46)  
Panthers (16) @ **Packers** (24)

#### _Record_

Titans (10-4)  
Packers (11-3)

#### _Weather_

Freezing with some snow expected. Also a bit windy. It's not good football weather, that's for sure.

#### _Injuries_

Titans are remarkably healthy. Only one of their starting linebackers will be out for the game.

Packers are pretty much fully healthy too, though one of their best players in Jamaal Adams is expected to be out.

#### _History / Analysis_

Not common for these two to meet, given that this is an inter-conference match. Still, it's been proven demonstrably this season the Packers struggle against teams that can effectively run the ball. And Tennessee, more than most other teams, love to run the ball behind their hard-nosed tailback. Add in the bad weather and you have the recipe for an upset.

Still, Tennessee has one of the worst defenses in the league. It's been getting a tad better over the past couple weeks, but it still has issues, notably along its defensive front. The Titans winning formula involves dominating time of possession, chiefly through its rushing attack. Green Bay is one of the most productive offenses in the league though, so it won't be easy winning wrist control over an offense that knows how to move the sticks.

Titans +3.5

**Tennessee will cover if**  
they can take advantage of the bad weather to run roughshod all over this soft Packers defensive front.

**Green Bay will cover if**  
they can keep Derrick Henry under wraps.
