Another week, another set of picks. Note that I won't be as intense these last couple weeks of the regular season. For one thing, I'm done with the SuperContest. This year was yet another failed try at placing in the contest. I learned quite a bit nonetheless. It's just a matter of waiting for that one year where all these lessons do seriously pay off - hopefully I won't be waiting too long.

More importantly, I'll be devoting much less time to my weekly picks as I'm doing some research for the playoffs. Predicting the postseason remains yet another major goal of mine, one that I know is within reach this year. 

That being said, I have two major plays this week, both involving playoff-bound teams. So let's go.

Other than losing a starting linebacker for the rest of the season, the Rams are pretty healthy, though they'll be missing their starting running back, Cam Akers.

Seattle's pretty healthy, though some of their offensive linemen may still be nursing some injuries, regardless of when they end up playing.
