## Browns @ Packers

Packers still have serious issue defending against mobile quarterbacks, let alone outside runs. Cleveland's been able to run the ball at will.

## Colts @ Cardinals

Back-to-back offsides calls. Vance Joseph's coaching is going to be called into question here.

Chandler Jones is such a difference maker. Truly elite.

Neither Carson Wentz nor Kyler Murray have shown much this evening. It's fair to say neither contribute much to the success of their offense lately. Especially disappointing to say that about Kyler given all the success he experienced early in the season. But as the season wears on him and without the one receiver capable of winning contested catches, Murray has lost that early-season magic.

No team has hit Jonathan Taylor for negative yardage more than Arizona this season. It's clear the Cardinals are amped for this game, though to be fair...Indianapolis is missing 80% of their offensive line.

Indianapolis was down four of its starting offensive linemen and still adjusted masterfully. Rolling pockets, play-action fakes, short hitch routes....all these things helped the Colts keep the ball moving on offense. Arizona's defense needs to be ashamed of itself.

Speaking of which...so many penalties were charged to Arizona's defense, helping to sustain Colt drives. Not good for a team supposedly bound for the playoffs.

## Rams @ Vikings

My suspicions of Matthew Stafford being cripplingly dependent on Cooper Kupp hasn't been alleviated at all today. And I'm still not sure OBJ can step up. He ran a nice route for a late-game touchdown, but his presence in the game has been otherwise muted.

## Bills @ Patriots

Bills defense has keyed in on some of the Patriots offensive concepts.

New England has some of the best drawn run plays I've seen this season.

Second Patriot drive and New England seems more intent on now passing the ball. However, Mac Jones low pass was tipped for the interception, killing the drive.
