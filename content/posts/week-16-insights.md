## Vikings @ Saints

Saints firing on all cylinders, especially in their ground game.

Drew Brees has his best throws when his receivers are able to separate hard from their defenders. Against man coverage defenders, Brees isn't as sharp, as we saw last week against Kansas City.

Jared Cook not running a hard enough slant to keep his defender from undercutting the pass, leading to an interception. Likewise, Sanders is really not exerting himself to catch those tough passes, as seen on one pass thrown slightly outside his reach, leading to Brees second interception.

## 49ers @ Cardinals

Murray not completely effective as a passer from the pocket, though Kliff is trying to get him into rhythm with uptempo short passes.

Nobody for the Cardinals stood out on offense outside of DeAndre Hopkins. On defense, Budda Baker, Hassan Reddick, and possibly Markus Golden stood out to me.

## Dolphins @ Raiders

Andrew Van Ginkel is a gamer for the Dolphins. Might be the best pass rusher on the team.

Might be better off putting the game on Gaskin's shoulders instead of Tua's soft hands. Gaskin has easily been the best offensive player for the Dolphins.

Tua can't really play drop-back football. He's a rhythm passer.

## Colts @ Steelers

Ben Roethlisberger needs to think about retirement.

Jonathan Taylor is a gamer. He's the tailback Indianapolis so desperately needs after losing Marlon Mack so early in the season.

Pittsburgh is finally sustaining success on offense using the hurry-up offense.

And naturally, when they start abandoning the hurry-up offense, their offense loses some of its momentum.

Still, nonetheless, solid comeback win for a Steelers team that hasn't shown much at all the past four or so weeks.

## Rams @ Seahawks

Wilson missing a wide-open receiver. Then he runs right into a very creative blitz by the Rams.

I see Jared Goff playing scared. Though he's been better in the second half, it's clear Goff's mood dictates the amount of success the Rams see on offense. I'm not sure why Goff is so scared either. None of Seattle's defensive players have been able to mount pressure consistently. Benson Mayowa has been arguably the best rusher, if only because he dislocated Goff's thumb.

Four-down stand by Seattle on a short goal-to-go series. Nicely done.

Both of these teams are trash. Rams are the better team, but Jared Goff is a huge liability. He doesn't quite have the hopeless optimism Russell Wilson has.

Jarran Reed and Benson Mayowa stepping up big to close out this game by keeping Jared Goff flustered.
