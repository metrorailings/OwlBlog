## Vikings @ Saints

Saints firing on all cylinders, especially in their ground game.

Drew Brees has his best throws when his receivers are able to separate hard from their defenders. Against man coverage defenders, Brees isn't as sharp, as we saw last week against Kansas City.

Jared Cook not running a hard enough slant to keep his defender from undercutting the pass, leading to an interception. Likewise, Sanders is really not exerting himself to catch those tough passes, as seen on one pass thrown slightly outside his reach, leading to Brees second interception.

## 49ers @ Cardinals

Murray not completely effective as a passer from the pocket, though Kliff is trying to get him into rhythm with uptempo short passes.

Nobody for the Cardinals stood out on offense outside of DeAndre Hopkins. On defense, Budda Baker, Hassan Reddick, and possibly Markus Golden stood out to me.

## Dolphins @ Raiders

Andrew Van Ginkel is a gamer for the Dolphins. Might be the best pass rusher on the team.

Might be better off putting the game on Gaskin's shoulders instead of Tua's soft hands. Gaskin has easily been the best offensive players for the Dolphins. Tua cannot really play drop-back football.
