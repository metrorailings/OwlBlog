## Vikings @ Saints

Saints firing on all cylinders, especially in their ground game.

Drew Brees has his best throws when his receivers are able to separate hard from their defenders. Against man coverage defenders, Brees isn't as sharp, as we saw last week against Kansas City.

Jared Cook not running a hard enough slant to keep his defender from undercutting the pass, leading to an interception. Likewise, Sanders is really not exerting himself to catch those tough passes, as seen on one pass thrown slightly outside his reach, leading to Brees second interception.

## 49ers @ Cardinals

Murray not straight effective as a passer from the pocket.
