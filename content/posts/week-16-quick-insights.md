## Texans @ Buccaneers

Jameis getting steadily better, though his turnover rate is still ridiculous.

Texans still have no viable pass rush without JJ Watt.

Houston actually has some quality pass coverage personnel, though this is Jameis we're talking about. Let's see how they perform against actual competition come playoff time.

## Bills @ Patriots

Bills are being gashed on the ground for steady yardage.

Some creative play-calling by the Patriots offense, throwing a ball to N'Keal Harry running a wheel route after play action.

Patriots making hay with heavy run formations here peppered with passes here and there. Good play-calling by Josh McDaniels.

Kyle Van Noy only down lineman on either team having any impact on this game, even if only on one play.

Dont'a Hightower managed to create pressure on a 3rd down.

Bills still insisting on singular man coverage on Julian Edelman.

I notice the Patriots chipping one of the Bills defensive lineman. Probably Shaq Lawson? Jerry Hughes?

Jordan Phillips creating a negative play for the Bills here with a run stuff.

Jerry Hughes and Dont'a Hightower stepping up in their pass rush.

Bills are finally stopping Patriot drives now that they're occasionally doubling Julian Edelman.

Patriot insisted on running man coverage, even on an end-of-half drive. That insistence cost them a touchdown.

Lots of double-clutching by Josh Allen. Seems to indicate uncertainty and a failure to read the coverage properly.
