## Texans @ Buccaneers

Jameis getting steadily better, though his turnover rate is still ridiculous.

Texans still have no viable pass rush without JJ Watt.

Houston actually has some quality pass coverage personnel, though this is Jameis we're talking about. Let's see how they perform against actual competition come playoff time.

## Bills @ Patriots

Bills are being gashed on the ground for steady yardage.

Some creative play-calling by the Patriots offense, throwing a ball to N'Keal Harry running a wheel route after play action.

Patriots making hay with heavy run formations here.
