## Cardinals @ Cowboys

Arizona nearly picked Dak off on _two screens_, of all plays. Arizona's defense has gained a read on Dallas' offense. Not good for Kellen Moore, who prides himself a creative mind on offense.

Michael Gallup deserves consideration as a vector.

AJ Green is definitely a vector for the Cardinals offense. He's come through on critical downs in multiple games.

Randy Gregory and Demarcus Lawrence has flashed on multiple occasions, but the Cardinals have matriculated the ball through a combination of trick plays, clever scheming, and the Dallas defensive backfield being caught slacking.
