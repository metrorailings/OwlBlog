## 49ers @ Seahawks

On the first drive, the 49ers defensive line won all their battles at the line of scrimmage. Arik Armstead and Nick Bosa have been impressive in particular.

The 49ers have some fantastic options on offense. George Kettle, Deebo Samuel, Emmanuel Sanders, Kyle Juscyzk, Raheem Mostert, and Matt Breida are all dependable vectors on offense.

More aggressive press coverage being played by the 49ers against these Seahawks. Impressive.

Some brilliant play from Russell Wilson on the Seahawks first scoring drive.

Arik Armstead impressing here, even though Nick Bosa is clearly the best down lineman on San Francisco.

Seahawks offense is doing so much better in the second half, largely because Russell Wilson is now throwing the ball to the right route-runners depending on whether the 49ers are in man coverage or zone coverage. It seems the 49ers are not really disguising their coverages too much in the second half. Once again speaks to Robert Saleh being an otherwise unremarkable defensive coach lucky to be working with so much talent.

DK Metcalf is truly a reliable vector on Seattle's offense.
