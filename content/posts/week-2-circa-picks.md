headline = "Week 2 Circa Millions Picks"

+++
And so we start the first year with the Circa Millions here. Week 1 was a bit of a crapshoot, especially given so many players have logged so little practice this year. Sloppy play and mistakes were a major theme last weekend, understandably so. Things shouldn't be that much different in the second week, but it should be easier picking games now that we've seen every team in live action. So let's get to it.

Ravens +4

**Baltimore covers if**  
they dominate time of possession by running the ball effectively and preventing the Chiefs offense from getting into any sort of rhythm early. It helps that the team should be seething coming off an emotional loss against the Raiders. On top of that, playing their homecoming game in primetime against a team that embarrassed them last year should only hype up the Ravens further.

**Kansas City covers if**  
they force the Ravens into a hole early, compelling Baltimore to call fewer rushing plays in favor of passes. Lamar isn't built to mount comebacks through the air. If this game scripts out roughly the same way as last year's match between these two teams, Kansas will be scratching one more tick in the win column come Sunday night.
