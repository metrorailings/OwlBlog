headline = "Week 2 Circa Millions Picks"

+++
And so we start the first year with the Circa Millions here. Week 1 was a bit of a crapshoot, especially given so many players have logged so little practice this year. Sloppy play and mistakes were a major theme last weekend, understandably so. Things shouldn't be that much different in the second week, but it should be easier picking games now that we've seen every team in live action. So let's get to it.

### Chiefs @ Ravens (+4)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Browns @ **Chiefs**  
Ravens @ **Browns** (MNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

#### _History_

Both these teams met last year, although Baltimore was the team favored in that match. Kansas routed the Ravens in this game though - Patrick Mahomes had no trouble dissecting Wink Martindale's blitzes and pass coverage schemes. It was almost beautiful seeing these Chiefs move the ball against the Ravens with such surgical precision. Baltimore was forced to abandon the ground game early in an effort to keep pace with the Chiefs offense. As expected, that didn't pan out.

#### _Weather_

Dome game, doesn't matter.

***

Ravens +4

***

**Baltimore covers if**  
they dominate time of possession by running the ball effectively and preventing the Chiefs offense from getting into any sort of rhythm early. It helps that the team should be seething coming off an emotional loss against the Raiders. On top of that, playing their homecoming game in primetime against a team that embarrassed them last year should only hype up the Ravens further.

**Kansas City covers if**  
they force the Ravens into a hole early, compelling Baltimore to call fewer rushing plays in favor of passes. Lamar isn't built to mount comebacks through the air. If this game scripts out roughly the same way as last year's match between these two teams, Kansas will be scratching one more tick in the win column come Sunday night.

### Bills @ Dolphins (+3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Steelers** @ Bills  
**Dolphins** @ Patriots

#### _Key Injuries_

Nothing major as of the time of this writing.

#### _History_

These teams regularly meet twice a year. Last season, the Bills won both of their contests, though the the first game doesn't mean much either given Ryan Fitzpatrick was helming the Dolphin offense. It's worth noting that the Bills managed to drop over fifty points in their second outing, despite the game ultimately being a meaningless rout in the grand scheme of things - Josh Allen sat out the second half as Buffalo's playoff seeding was cemented by then.

#### _Weather_

Hot and humid, as is typical in Florida in September.

***

(Leaning) Dolphins +3.5

***

**Buffalo covers if**  
Josh Allen hasn't regressed much from last year. All other variables being equal from last year (more or less), the Bills have shown themselves superior to Miami.

**Miami covers if**  
Josh Allen reverts back to his older pathetic form  
\- OR -  
the additions of Jaylen Waddle and Will Fuller on offense in tandem with the emergence of pass rusher Sam Eguavoen prove to be the requisite elements giving Miami enough juice to finally pull one over Buffalo.

### 49ers @ Eagles (+3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**49ers** @ Lions  
**Eagles** @ Falcons

#### _Key Injuries_

No major issues as of yet with either team. A few players on both sides are banged up, but all key personnel are expected to play. San Francisco will be down a starting cornerback in Jason Verrett for the rest of the season. 

#### _History_

Both of these teams met last year in California. San Francisco was coping with season-ending injuries to leaders on both offense and defense. Philadelphia wasn't faring much better themselves on the health front either, though their injuries were concentrated more on offense.

Philadelphia was able to pull out the win at eight-point underdogs. Pretty impressive considering Doug Pederson was committed to sabotaging his team.

#### _Weather_

Unseasonably warm, with a good bit of humidity.

***

Eagles +3.5

***

**Philadelphia covers if**  
their newly renovated (and markedly healthier) offense under Hurts/Sirianni surprises and throws the 49ers off their defensive game plan. If the 49ers are forced to play more reactionary defense this early in the season, missteps and bad decisions are likely to follow.

**San Francisco covers if**  
the return of Jimmy Garoppolo, Nick Bosa, and Dee Ford end up making a bigger difference than I thought. 

***

### Cowboys @ Chargers (-3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Cowboys @ **Buccaneers**  
**Chargers** @ Washington

#### _Key Injuries_

DeMarcus Lawrence is expected to be sidelined several weeks as he recovers from a broken foot. Randy Gregory is currently on the COVID list. Without those two, the Cowboys best pass rusher might be rookie Micah Parsons. Not a great situation for the Chargers going against one of the NFL's better quarterbacks.

As for the Chargers, we need to keep an eye on their injury report come Friday. Some key veterans were sitting out Wednesday's practice.

#### _History_

These two teams don't face one another all too often, being in different conferences. No easy comparables can be safely drawn here too.

***

Chargers -3.5

***

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Justin Herbert stays insulated from pressure. It helps that Dallas is down their two best pass rushers this week. Also, seeing the offensive line hold up admirably last week in pass protection against Washington's venerable defensive front is reassuring.

**Dallas covers if  
**their offense can dominate time of possession by emphasizing the ground game. Very possible given Brandon Staley seems more committed to pass coverage than rushing defense. His lightly-manned defensive fronts worry me here - it's not easy bringing down Ezekiel Elliott with just five or six men stationed in the box.
