headline = "Week 2 Circa Millions Picks"

+++
And so we start the first year with the Circa Millions here. Week 1 was a bit of a crapshoot, especially given so many players have logged so little practice this year. Sloppy play and mistakes were a major theme last weekend, understandably so. Things shouldn't be that much different in the second week, but it should be easier picking games now that we've seen every team in live action. So let's get to it.

### Chiefs @ Ravens (+4)

#### _Latest Results_

Browns @ **Chiefs**  
Ravens @ **Browns** (MNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

#### _History_

Both these teams met last year, although Baltimore was the team favored in that match. Kansas routed the Ravens in this game though - Patrick Mahomes had no trouble dissecting Wink Martindale's blitzes and pass coverage schemes. It was almost beautiful seeing these Chiefs move the ball against the Ravens with such surgical precision. Baltimore was forced to abandon the ground game early in an effort to keep pace with the Chiefs offense. As expected, that didn't pan out.

Dome game, doesn't matter.

Ravens +4

**Baltimore covers if**  
they dominate time of possession by running the ball effectively and preventing the Chiefs offense from getting into any sort of rhythm early. It helps that the team should be seething coming off an emotional loss against the Raiders. On top of that, playing their homecoming game in primetime against a team that embarrassed them last year should only hype up the Ravens further.

**Kansas City covers if**  
they force the Ravens into a hole early, compelling Baltimore to call fewer rushing plays in favor of passes. Lamar isn't built to mount comebacks through the air. If this game scripts out roughly the same way as last year's match between these two teams, Kansas will be scratching one more tick in the win column come Sunday night.

### Bills @ Dolphins (+3.5)

#### _Latest Results_

**Steelers** @ Bills  
**Dolphins** @ Patriots

#### _Key Injuries_

Nothing major as of the time of this writing.

#### _History_

These teams regularly meet twice a year. Last season, the Bills won both of their contests, though the the first game doesn't mean much either given Ryan Fitzpatrick was helming the Dolphin offense. It's worth noting that the Bills managed to drop over fifty points in their second outing, despite the game ultimately being a meaningless rout in the grand scheme of things - Josh Allen sat out the second half as Buffalo's playoff seeding was cemented by then.

#### _Weather_

Hot and humid, as is typical in Florida in September.

they can force some ugly throws out of Josh Allen. Allen may be regressing, given his horrid outing against the Steelers last week.
