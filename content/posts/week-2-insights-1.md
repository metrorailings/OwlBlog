## Giants @ Washington

I'd say Heinecke is developing a near-crippling addiction to Terry McLaurin. It's hard to blame him though...McLaurin makes a damn good living playing wide receiver.

Giants are playing quite a bit of cover-four in the secondary. Not to mention they're keeping their cornerbacks pretty distanced from Washington's receivers pre-snap.

Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley playing so much better after their pathetic showing last Sunday. I'm liking what I'm seeing. Saquon's actually cutting again! The appetite for yards is there.

Giants offensive line playing much better as well, holding up against Washington's blitzes as well as their best pass rushers. Doesn't mean they've won every battle, but they're winning a decent number of them. It's hard to win every battle against the likes of Chase Young, Montez Sweat, and Jonathan Allen.

Washington's offensive line is proficient at run-blocking.

## Jets @ Patriots

Jets defense have been reacting well to the Patriots and their offensive scheming.

## 49ers @ Eagles

Eagles defensive line dominating at the line of scrimmage. It's a thing of beauty.

Jalen Reagor could be something special.
