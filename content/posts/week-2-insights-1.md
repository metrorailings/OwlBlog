## Giants @ Washington

I'd say Heinecke is developing a near-crippling addiction to Terry McLaurin. It's hard to blame him though...McLaurin makes a damn good living playing wide receiver.

Giants are playing quite a bit of cover-four in the secondary. Not to mention they're keeping their cornerbacks pretty distanced from Washington's receivers pre-snap.

Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley playing so much better after their pathetic showing last Sunday. I'm liking what I'm seeing. Saquon's actually cutting again! The appetite for yards is there.

Giants offensive line playing much better as well, holding up against Washington's blitzes as well as their best pass rushers. Doesn't mean they've won every battle, but they're winning a decent number of them. It's hard to win every battle against the likes of Chase Young, Montez Sweat, and Jonathan Allen.

Washington's offensive line is proficient at run-blocking.

## Jets @ Patriots

Jets defense have been reacting well to the Patriots and their offensive scheming.

Mac Jones is looking more and more like a professional quarterback. His pocket presence, his composure, his passing form, it's all looking better.

## 49ers @ Eagles

Eagles defensive line dominating at the line of scrimmage. It's a thing of beauty.

Jalen Reagor could be something special.

Philadelphia's defensive line is very aggressive. Screens can exploit this aggressive tendency.

Jimmy G looking sloppy on a few throws. That and I think he's making the wrong decisions on some play. He chose to run the ball on a third down and eight instead of pitching the shovel pass forward.

49ers defense holding up well on four downs at the goal line. Sirianni tried to run the Philly special on fourth down, but the 49ers was too disciplined in coverage.
