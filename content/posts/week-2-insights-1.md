## Giants @ Washington

I'd say Heinecke is developing a near-crippling addiction to Terry McLaurin. It's hard to blame him though...McLaurin makes a damn good living playing wide receiver.

Giants are playing quite a bit of cover-four in the secondary. Not to mention they're keeping their cornerbacks pretty distanced from Washington's receivers pre-snap.

Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley playing so much better after their pathetic showing last Sunday. I'm liking what I'm seeing. Saquon's actually cutting again! The appetite for yards is there.

Giants offensive line playing much better as well, holding up against Washington's blitzes as well as their best pass rushers. Doesn't mean they've won every battle, but they're winning a decent number of them. It's hard to win every battle against the likes of Chase Young, Montez Sweat, and Jonathan Allen.

Washington's offensive line is proficient at run-blocking.

## Jets @ Patriots

Jets defense have been reacting well to the Patriots and their offensive scheming.

Mac Jones is looking more and more like a professional quarterback. His pocket presence, his composure, his passing form, it's all looking better.

## 49ers @ Eagles

Eagles defensive line dominating at the line of scrimmage. It's a thing of beauty.

Jalen Reagor could be something special.

Philadelphia's defensive line is very aggressive. Screens can exploit this aggressive tendency.

Jimmy G looking sloppy on a few throws. That and I think he's making the wrong decisions on some plays. He chose to run the ball on a 3rd and eight instead of pitching the shovel pass forward.

49ers defense holding up well on four downs at the goal line. Sirianni tried to run the Philly special on fourth down, but the 49ers was too disciplined in coverage.

Kudos to Kyle Shanahan for keeping his team out east over the past week, helping them acclimate not only to the time zone, but also against the stifling humidity.

Jimmie Ward playing well for the 49ers, breaking up the deep passes. Speaking of which, I notice Hurts isn't afraid to lob the ball deep. An admirable quality for a quarterback still cutting his teeth.

I'm not sure if San Francisco's secondary is amazing or simply exploiting Hurts' inexperience. Either way, DeMeco Ryan deserves credit for coaching a defense absolutely smothering frustrating Philadelphia's offense.

The Eagles are mentally rattled here. Not a good thing for a team trying to mount a comeback.

## Rams @ Colts

Carson Wentz is still holding on to the ball for too long.

I cannot for the life of me fathom why Indianapolis' defense is playing so few men in the box. Eberflus has to be completely spooked by this Rams passing offense.

## Raiders @ Steelers

Is Jon Gruden honestly outcoaching Keith Butler?

***

## Cowboys @ Chargers

Impressive defensive trickery from the Chargers. Herbert was convinced Dallas is running man coverage, but the Cowboys shuffle out to a zone look at the last second.

As predicted, the Cowboys are gashing these Chargers with rushing plays and pseudo-run concepts.

Storm Norton isn't a good replacement at all for Brian Bulaga.

Dallas moving Micah Parsons in as defensive end given Randy Gregory or DeMarcus Lawrence aren't playing.
