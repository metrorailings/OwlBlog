## Bengals @ Browns

Nick Chubb a beast, as expected.

Baker Mayfield distributing the ball equitably among his receivers.

Cleveland's offensive line held up well against a blitz on a red zone play that resulted in a touchdown.

Mayfield loves breaking out of the side of the pocket.

Joe Woods enjoys calling blitzes.

Joe Burrow particularly dependent on A.J. Green in the 2-minute drill.

## Giants @ Bears

The Giants and their obnoxious attitude against the pass rush is affording Mitch Trubisky a whole bunch of time here. Trubisky is lighting up the scoreboard here as New York is giving him literally all day in the pocket.

Offense looking discombobulated. Part of that is on the offensive line not giving Daniel Jones enough protection, but it's clearly Jason Garrett's gameplan here is absolute trash.

Giants were finally money on one drive that consisted of largely short passes to receivers in the flat. No splash play, but the Bears seemed content giving these short gains over to New York.

Unfortunately, New York couldn't count on that single dimension of offense to carry them to victory. Damn shame too, as they came close. But the Giants need to start investing in deep balls if they want to matriculate the ball more consistently.

## Chiefs @ Chargers

Chargers successfully harassing Mahomes on just about every passing play.

Los Angeles is gambling a bit too much with the pass rush, leaving open lanes that Mahomes was able to exploit on two critical downs.

Austin Ekeler a world-class talent.
