## Bengals @ Browns

Nick Chubb a beast, as expected.

Baker Mayfield distributing the ball equitably among his receivers.

Cleveland's offensive line held up well against a blitz on a red zone play that resulted in a touchdown.

Mayfield loves breaking out of the side of the pocket.

Joe Woods enjoys calling blitzes.

Joe Burrow particularly dependent on A.J. Green in the 2-minute drill.

## Giants @ Bears

The Giants and their obnoxious attitude against the pass rush is affording Mitch Trubisky a whole bunch of time here. Trubisky is lighting up the scoreboard here as New York is giving him literally all day in the pocket.

Offense looking discombobulated. Part of that is on the offensive line not giving Daniel Jones enough protection, but it's clearly Jason Garrett's gameplan here is absolute trash.

Giants were finally money on one drive that consisted of largely short passes to receivers in the flat. No splash play, but the Bears seemed content giving these short gains over to New York.

Unfortunately, New York couldn't count on that single dimension of offense to carry them to victory. Damn shame too, as they came close. But the Giants need to start investing in deep balls if they want to matriculate the ball more consistently.

## Chiefs @ Chargers

Chargers successfully harassing Mahomes on just about every passing play.

Los Angeles is gambling a bit too much with the pass rush, leaving open lanes that Mahomes was able to exploit on two critical downs.

Austin Ekeler a world-class talent.

Herbert with an impressive pass against a tight cover-three zone for the touchdown.

Chargers defense have a beat on this Chiefs offense, even sniffing out screens before they get a chance to develop.

Herbert playing intelligently on two plays, throwing away the ball as the play fails to develop.

And just like that, a dumb play by Herbert ends a promising drive.

Late down the stretch, the Chiefs defensive front seems to be winning their battles in the trenches. This is either an indictment of the Chargers offensive line or an indication as to the simplicity of the Chargers offense now that it's being helmed by a rookie quarterback making his first start.

## Rams @ Eagles

Philadelphia's defense has bee working hard to try and pressure Goff, but the problem is that Goff is getting rid of the ball too quickly. The Eagles have been pretty generous giving away short passes, though McVay probably schemed quite a few of those short plays.

Bad passes from Carson Wentz and uninspiring offensive plays seem to define Philadelphia's scripted offense.

So long as things go according to plan, Goff excels in McVay's system. So kudos to McVay for reading Jim Schwartz well enough to counter his style of defense.

Speaking of Schwartz...it may be high time to move on if he's unable to adapt in situations like these.

By finally running the ball through light boxes, exposing weakly-defended flats, and incorporating some clever play fakes, the Eagles were able to end a drive with a touchdown.

The right side of the Philly offensive line seems to be a major liability.

It took until 3:06 into the 2nd quarter, but Jared Goff finally registered an incomplete pass, courtesy of pressure from Fletcher Cox.

## Patriots @ Seahawks

The Patriots anemic pass rush is affording too much time to Russell Wilson. Seems to me that Wilson can outlast the Patriots great secondary.

Seahawks are rough on defense, but I never quite realized until now they're surprisingly talented along the back parts of their defense. The front lines need work, but the hope there is that one or two defensive linemen drafted over the past three years can break out into elite players.

Seattle is a team jacked with testosterone.

Russell Wilson has been absolutely money on his deep passing. No other quarterback in the league compares except for maybe Patrick Mahomes. His throws are so good that New England's best man coverage corners are getting exposed.

So many of Cam's throws are targeted over the middle. Not sure what the thought process here is. Are the Patriots expecting the middle of the field to be consistently wide open so long as Seattle sticks with its cover-three defensive formations and the linebackers stay close to the line of scrimmage in anticipation of a quarterback run?

The fact that Seattle's coverage unit is still playing at a high level despite losing quite a few defensive backs is impressive. It speaks to the way this team is so amped. Broken tackles aren't really much of an issue too for the Seahawks.

Then again, maybe the Patriots aren't so good passing the ball anymore. The fact that Josh Allen booked over 400 yards against the Dolphins this week tells me Cam's passing numbers last week were even more pathetic than they first appeared.

But it's also worth noting that James White is missing in action too. And White is arguably the team's second best receiver.

The Seahawks have zero pass rush. Zero. Their best pass rusher is a strong safety in Jamal Adams.

## Vikings @ Colts

Vikings started off with three vintage Kubiak bootlegs.

The Colts are doubling down on their run-first identity. Their first drive included 12 designated run plays. Might also be an attempt to exploit the Vikings' nickel defense, though it is concerning to see Reich so headstrong with his emphasis on the rushing game.
