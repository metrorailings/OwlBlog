## Bills @ Giants

The Bills' man coverage is real.

The Giants' man coverage is lame though. DeAndre Baker is a particular point of weakness.

If it wasn't for some early runs from Saquon Barkley and slant routes, the Giants offense would have been complete rudderless.

Josh Allen is committing to staying in the pocket. Though it's easy to do so considering New York's gutless pass rush.

## 49ers @ Bengals

Kwan Alexander is quite passionate and embraces the leadership role he's been given on defense.

The Bengals are looking hopeless when it comes to defending against opposing runners. 

***

## Eagles @ Falcons

Isaac Seumalo is a point of weakness along the Eagles offensive line.

Grady Jarrett is a beast. Easily the best pass rusher on Atlanta's defensive line.
