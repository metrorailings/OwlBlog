## Bills @ Giants

The Bills' man coverage is real.

The Giants' man coverage is lame though. DeAndre Baker is a particular point of weakness.

If it wasn't for some early runs from Saquon Barkley and slant routes, the Giants offense would have been complete rudderless.

Josh Allen is committing to staying in the pocket. Though it's easy to do so considering New York's gutless pass rush.

## 49ers @ Bengals

Kwan Alexander is quite passionate and embraces the leadership role he's been given on defense.

The Bengals are looking hopeless at defending against teams that are good at running the ball. Outside runs in particular bewilder Cincinnati's defense.

San Francisco's misdirection on play-action resulting in big plays.

Lack of creativity by the Bengals offense. Was the game plan here really to simply drop Andy Dalton back five or seven paces behind his offensive line and have him sling the ball to his receivers, with an occasional run by Joe Mixon?

Cincinnati's defense is a mess in coverage and run defense.

Playing from behind leaves the Cincinnati offense in a bit of a precarious situation, given their offensive line kinda sucks in pass protection

## Chargers @ Lions

Chargers run defense still remains suspect despite Thomas Davis now patrolling the middle of the field as the team's lead linebacker.

Austin Ekeler is a beast.

The Chargers run solid screens with Ekeler. Two big screens mostly negated due to iffy penalties, sadly.  Craif Wrolstad and his referees are a litigious bunch.

The replacement place kicker is truly terrible. The Chargers **desperately** need their primary field goal kicker back in action.

***

## Eagles @ Falcons

Isaac Seumalo is a point of weakness along the Eagles offensive line.

Grady Jarrett is a beast. Easily the best pass rusher on Atlanta's defensive line.

Creative blitzes by Jim Schwartz is throwing Matt Ryan off his game and keeping the Eagles alive in this game. Worth noting that these blitzes usually  mandate man coverage with no safety patrolling the deep field.

Carson Wentz playing sensationally despite not having either Desean Jackson or Alshon Jeffery on offense.

Calvin Ridley is undoubtedly the Falcons' second receiver.

Considering the injury circumstances and the emotional edge in this game going to the Falcons, the Eagles were the better team here.
