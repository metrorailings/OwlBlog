## Bills @ Giants

The Bills' man coverage is real.

The Giants' man coverage is lame though. DeAndre Baker is a particular point of weakness.

If it wasn't for some early runs from Saquon Barkley and slant routes, the Giants offense would have been complete rudderless.

Josh Allen is committing to staying in the pocket. Though it's easy to do so considering New York's gutless pass rush.
