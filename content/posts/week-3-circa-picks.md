Week 2 came and I underwhelmed, going 3-2. It could've been much better, but I foolishly trusted a Steelers team with a limp-wristed offense. On top of that, I also trusted a rookie head coach in his first-even start against an seasoned head coach. I won't be making those mistakes again. In today's NFL, offensive production matters so much more than defensive production. Pittsburgh is a wretched team to be avoided unless they're taking points or facing comparably awful teams.

Anyway, let's go at it.

**Minnesota covers if**  
they own time of possession through a ground game led by Dalvin Cook. Russell can't cook if he only has so much time in the kitchen.

**Seattle covers if**  
they can regroup after a disastrous outing against Derrick Henry and keep Cook in check through their base cover-three defense. The Seahawks need to put the onus of production on Kirk Cousin's shoulders. If they do that, Russell Wilson will have enough opportunities to score himself. And if Wilson can run his scrambles as effectively as Kyler Murray last week, Seattle should be able to net enough points on offense to win this game.

### Chargers @ Chiefs (-6.5)

#### _Latest Results_

**Cowboys** @ Chargers  
Chiefs @ **Ravens**

#### _Key Injuries_

TBD

#### History

As divisional opponents, these two teams meet regularly. But this will be the first year head coach Brandon Staley actually faces off against an opponent. I'm not sure if past games matter here, especially because the Chiefs faced off against the Chargers in games that can't be evaluated in the same context as this game.

That being said, this will be the first time this season Kansas City's defense faces off against an opposing offense not primarily defined by its ground game. While the Chiefs' defensive outfit has been historically disappointing these past two weeks, it's not fair to condemn the unit to futility given the nature of those offenses against which it faced off.

A lovely day for some football.

Chiefs -6.5

***

**Kansas City covers if**  
their defense can regularly harangue Justin Herbert by exploiting the right side of the Chargers offensive line through blitzes and strategic pass rushing. It would also help if the Chiefs play with more emotion coming off an embarrassing defeat in primetime.

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Justin Herbert is allowed to manage the offense without Kansas City's pass rushers harassing him much.

### Packers @ 49ers (-3.5)

#### _Latest Results_

Lions @ **Packers**  
**49ers** @ Eagles

#### _Key Injuries_

TBD

#### History

Two years ago, San Francisco hammered Green Bay twice, once in the regular season and once in the conference championships. The Packers were clearly the inferior team, unable to cope with San Francisco's complex rushing game and its suffocating pass rush.

Last year, the tables were turned - Green Bay dominated in their rematch against a 49ers team plagued by injuries. George Kittle, Dee Ford, Jimmy Garoppalo, Nick Bosa, Brandon Aiyuk, Raheem Mostert...so many of their stars were sidelined.
