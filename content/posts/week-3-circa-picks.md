Week 2 came and I underwhelmed, going 3-2. It could've been much better, but I foolishly trusted a Steelers team with a limp-wristed offense. On top of that, I also trusted a rookie head coach in his first-even start against an seasoned head coach. I won't be making those mistakes again. In today's NFL, offensive production matters so much more than defensive production. Pittsburgh is a wretched team to be avoided unless they're taking points or facing comparably awful teams.

Anyway, let's go at it.

### Seahawks @ Vikings (+2)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Titans** @ Seahawks  
Vikings @ **Cardinals**

#### _Key Injuries_

Dalvin Cook isn't practicing for the Vikings. Not good to see their best offensive player unable to even practice on a limited basis by Thursday.

#### History

Both these teams met last year in a close-fought match. Dalvin Cook was balling out and led Minnesota to an early lead, but the Seahawks were able to rally in the second half, edging the Vikings out in a one point victory.

#### _Weather_

Dome game, it doesn't matter.

Uncertain

**Minnesota covers if**  
they own time of possession through a ground game led by Dalvin Cook. Russell can't cook if he only has so much time in the kitchen.

**Seattle covers if**  
they can regroup after a disastrous outing against Derrick Henry and keep Cook in check through their base cover-three defense. The Seahawks need to put the onus of production on Kirk Cousin's shoulders. If they do that, Russell Wilson will have enough opportunities to score himself. And if Wilson can run his scrambles as effectively as Kyler Murray did last week against these Minnesota boys, Seattle should be able to net enough points on offense to win this game.

### Chargers @ Chiefs (-6.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Cowboys** @ Chargers  
Chiefs @ **Ravens**

#### _Key Injuries_

Two key cogs in the Chargers defense aren't practicing - Joey Bosa and Chris Harris. Even worse though going forward is the fact that Bryan Bulaga will be out for the foreseeable future. The ramifications of Bulaga's absence will be felt dearly so long as LA's offensive coordinator insists on not giving his offensive line any help in pass protection.

#### History

As divisional opponents, these two teams meet regularly. But this will be the first year head coach Brandon Staley actually faces off against an opponent. I'm not sure if past games matter here, especially because the Chiefs faced off against the Chargers in games that can't be evaluated in the same context as this game.

That being said, this will be the first time this season Kansas City's defense faces off against an opposing offense not primarily defined by its ground game. While the Chiefs' defensive outfit has been historically disappointing these past two weeks, it's not fair to condemn the unit to futility given the nature of those offenses against which it faced off.

#### _Weather_

A lovely day for some football.

Chiefs -6.5

***

**Kansas City covers if**  
their defense can regularly harangue Justin Herbert by exploiting the right side of the Chargers offensive line through blitzes and strategic pass rushing. It would also help if the Chiefs play with more emotion coming off an embarrassing defeat in primetime.

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Justin Herbert is allowed to manage the offense without Kansas City's pass rushers harassing him much.

### Packers @ 49ers (-3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Lions @ **Packers**  
**49ers** @ Eagles

#### _Key Injuries_

San Francisco will be coming into this game without the services of their main tailbacks, that's for sure. More concerning though is that Arik Armstead hasn't been practicing at all this week. The 49ers need all their top defensive linemen suited up when Aaron Rodgers comes into town.

#### History

Two years ago, San Francisco hammered Green Bay twice, once in the regular season and once in the conference championships. The Packers were clearly the inferior team, unable to cope with San Francisco's complex ground game and its suffocating pass rush.

Last year, tables were turned - Green Bay dominated in their rematch against a 49ers team plagued by injuries. George Kittle, Dee Ford, Jimmy Garoppalo, Nick Bosa, Brandon Aiyuk, Raheem Mostert...so many of their stars were unable to play. On top of that, not having fans negated San Francisco's lovely home field advantage.

Rewatching that game though...I noticed something odd - San Francisco last year ran far fewer rushing plays against the Packers than the year before. Its a strategy made all the more bizarre considering Nick Mullens was forced to starting quarterback. In the first half, only 9 rushes were attempted. Compare that to the first half of the 2019 NFC conference championship, where Shanahan called 22 rushes.

All things said, San Francisco's performance wasn't so horrid last year. Green Bay still won in a landslide, but it wasn't as easy a win as was expected beforehand.

#### _Weather_

Easy California weather.

***

49ers -3.5

***

**San Francisco covers if**  
they can establish their ground game against a Green Bay defense known surrendering yards against opposing rushers. To more specifically quantify this, the 49ers need to call more runs than passes in the first half.

**Green Bay covers if**  
they can keep the 49ers from popping off on early downs with their ground game. The Packers need to put the onus of production on Jimmy Garoppalo's shoulders. Unlike Mike Pettine, Joe Barry needs to prioritize the run defense first, even if it means risking some big pass plays. It remains to be seen whether Barry's capable of pulling off that shift in focus though.

### Buccaneers @ Rams (-1.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Falcons @ **Buccaneers**  
**Rams** @ Colts

#### _Key Injuries_

TBD

#### History

These two teams have faced off last year. Even though Los Angeles only won by three points, the team had no problems maintaining wrist control through the whole match. Brady's attempts to stage a second-half comeback were constantly quashed by the Rams pass rush.

#### _Weather_

Dome game

***

Rams -1

***

**Los Angeles covers if**  
they execute the same offensive game plan against the Bucs. It was a plan so sound that Jared Goff had no issue keeping the offense humming in Tampa Bay. Imagine what a seasoned quarterback like Stafford could do with that blueprint, especially on home field.

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
McVay and the Rams coaches decide to be cute with the game plan. Last year's game plan was so successful for the Rams mainly because Jared Goff was getting rid of the ball way too quickly for the pass rush to impact him. Given the Buccaneer secondary isn't an elite group by any means, it was all too easy to keep the chains moving so long as Tampa's pass rushers didn't have enough time to compress the pocket.
