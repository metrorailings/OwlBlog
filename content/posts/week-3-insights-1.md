## Panthers @ Texans

I notice the Panthers run quite a few hard play-action fakes from under center. The Texans seems to have picked up on this as well, given the number of times their defenders have keyed in on Darnold after the handoff.

Brandin Cooks is a real gamer for the Texans. He and Davis Mills are building a special bond.

David Culley has been too cowardly at times, opting to punt the ball in opponent territory on multiple occasions.

## Falcons @ Giants

A two-man pass rush, Giants? What the fuck...? How is that even possible?

On a drive when momentum was railing hard against the Falcons, Atlanta still managed to convert four 3rd downs en route to a touchdown. Well done, New York.

## Buccaneers @ Rams

The Rams offensive line being beaten hard at the line of scrimmage so far...why they're not hurrying up, I don't know why.
