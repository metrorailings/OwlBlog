## Panthers @ Texans

I notice the Panthers run quite a few hard play-action fakes from under center. The Texans seems to have picked up on this as well, given the number of times their defenders have keyed in on Darnold after the handoff.

Brandin Cooks is a real gamer for the Texans. He and Davis Mills are building a special bond.

David Culley has been too cowardly at times, opting to punt the ball in opponent territory on multiple occasions.
