## Panthers @ Texans

I notice the Panthers run quite a few hard play-action fakes from under center. The Texans seems to have picked up on this as well, given the number of times their defenders have keyed in on Darnold after the handoff.

Brandin Cooks is a real gamer for the Texans. He and Davis Mills are building a special bond.

David Culley has been too cowardly at times, opting to punt the ball in opponent territory on multiple occasions.

## Falcons @ Giants

A two-man pass rush, Giants? What the fuck...? How is that even possible?

On a drive when momentum was railing hard against the Falcons, Atlanta still managed to convert four 3rd downs en route to a touchdown. Well done, New York.

## Buccaneers @ Rams

The Rams offensive line being beaten hard at the line of scrimmage so far...why they're not hurrying up, I don't know why.

Finally, the Rams incorporating the hurry-up to their offense to keep Tampa's pass rush at bay. Solid adjustment.

I'll tell you this - Tampa's screen game has been on point. Some of their best plays on offense have come courtesy of well-executed screens. It helps that the Rams aren't a team big on racking the box with defenders.

Needless to say, the relationship between Cooper Kupp and Matthew Stafford is truly special. 

On top of that, Desean Jackson has emerged as a viable weapon for these Rams, especially in the hurry-up offense.

## Jets @ Broncos

Denver's rookie halfback is impressing so far, but credit is also due to the team's run blocking.

Wilson truly needs to get rid of the ball quicker given the shoddy state of the offensive line.

Zack Wilson impressing me on an improvised pass despite the pass ultimately not connecting with his targeted receiver.

I'm honestly not sure what this Jets team is doing on offense. Mike LaFleur is playing some weak cards on offense and isn't even doing much to dress them up. On top of that, the ground game is virtually nonexistent, something that simply can't be happening if you're running a modified version of the Shanahan offense.

The Jets may have the worst offensive line in the league. Not an easy accomplishment too, given the state of the Giants offensive line. But it's a truly shit offensive line.  Against solid defensive fronts, the offense is damn near hopeless.
