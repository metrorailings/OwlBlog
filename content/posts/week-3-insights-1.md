## Panthers @ Texans

I notice the Panthers run quite a few hard play-action fakes from under center. The Texans seems to have picked up on this as well, given the number of times their defenders have keyed in on Darnold after the handoff.

Brandin Cooks is a real gamer for the Texans. He and Davis Mills are building a special bond.

David Culley has been too cowardly at times, opting to punt the ball in opponent territory on multiple occasions.

## Falcons @ Giants

A two-man pass rush, Giants? What the fuck...? How is that even possible?

On a drive when momentum was railing hard against the Falcons, Atlanta still managed to convert four 3rd downs en route to a touchdown. Well done, New York.

## Buccaneers @ Rams

The Rams offensive line being beaten hard at the line of scrimmage so far...why they're not hurrying up, I don't know why.

Finally, the Rams incorporating the hurry-up to their offense to keep Tampa's pass rush at bay. Solid adjustment.

I'll tell you this - Tampa's screen game has been on point. Some of their best plays on offense have come courtesy of well-executed screens. It helps that the Rams aren't a team big on racking the box with defenders.

Needless to say, the relationship between Cooper Kupp and Matthew Stafford is truly special.

On top of that, DeSean Jackson has emerged as a viable weapon for these Rams, especially in the hurry-up offense.

Tom Brady may be an elite quarterback. His pocket presence, ability to navigate through pressure, and the crisp accuracy of his throws are making a great case for his eliteness.

Have to love Tampa Bay's penchant for penalties.

Rewatching the game...noticing Los Angeles took their time to incorporate the hurry-up offense, but when they did...it consisted of quick lateral throws, throws to out-breaking routes, and heavy personnel rushing. It worked.

The Buccaneers offense seem to have adjusted a bit in the second half by targeting the soft flat some more with crossing routes and screens.

The Rams offensive line is impressing me in the second half by holding up against the Buccaneers defensive line in pass protection. It's clear Tampa Bay's no longer taking as many chances as before with the blitz, but Stafford is clearly being given more than enough time to find his targets. Perhaps Jason Pierre-Paul would have made more of a difference had he been present in the game, but Tampa's defensive line hasn't held up their end of the bargain, especially now that Bowles has retreated back on the blitz a bit.

## Jets @ Broncos

Denver's rookie halfback is impressing so far, but credit is also due to the team's run blocking.

Wilson truly needs to get rid of the ball quicker given the shoddy state of the offensive line.

Zack Wilson impressing me on an improvised pass despite the pass ultimately not connecting with his targeted receiver.

I'm honestly not sure what this Jets team is doing on offense. Mike LaFleur is playing some weak cards on offense and isn't even doing much to dress them up. On top of that, the ground game is virtually nonexistent, something that simply can't be happening if you're running a modified version of the Shanahan offense.

The Jets may have the worst offensive line in the league. Not an easy accomplishment too, given the state of the Giants offensive line. But it's a truly shit offensive line.  Against solid defensive fronts, the offense is damn near hopeless.

## Packers @ 49ers

Shanahan isn't running the ball as much as I expected. Neither is he running the same type of rushing plays that were so much money about a year and a half ago. If I had to take a guess why...it's because Shanahan doesn't trust his tailbacks. Contrary to my initial expectations, tailbacks cannot simply be plugged into this system. They need to be adjusted into place.

It's because of that limitation in the ground game that the 49ers are struggling. Jimmy Garropalo can't be trusted to carry the game on his shoulders.

The 49ers not running the ball from the 1-yard line is worrying. Granted, only about 11 seconds were left on the clock, but San Francisco used to pride itself on its ground game being able to create positive yardage. No more.

49ers defense now playing very conservatively. I understand the secondary depth is thin, but San Francisco is all too happy giving everything up underneath, be it rush or pass.

## Chargers @ Chiefs

The Chargers were fortunate to catch their first turnover off a ricocheted pass.

The Chiefs seem far more concerned about nailing big plays than on simple offensive fundamentals meant to keep the ball secure. Reckless throws, sloppy ball handling, etc.

Honestly, these Chiefs cornerbacks can't handle the size of these Charger receivers. Their slant routes and curls seem to be too much.

Chiefs aren't getting much pressure from anyone not named Chris Jones.

These Chiefs offensive line is getting manhandled by the Chargers and their defensive front. Even worse, the offensive line is failing on well-timed screens.

***

## Seahawks @ Vikings

DK Metcalf a difference maker on offense. Seattle's deep passes have come courtesy of DK Metcalf.

Good scheming by Seahawks going into the second quarter, using a combination of runs and screen concepts to matriculate the ball downfield.

This Seahawks defense acts incredibly idiotic going into the end of a half. Playing prevent defense against Kirk Cousins and the Kubiak offense isn't necessary, especially when Kirk has done nothing but throw the ball short all day.

This Seattle defense hasn't been good all day. The biggest positive is that the Seahawks have hit home multiple times on blitzes, though those blitzes have been risky given that their defense has had to resort to man coverage then.

## Bengals vs Steelers

The Bengals are actually pretty good at defensing the run. I'll need to see more in their next match-up against the inept Jaguars, but it's possible Cincinnati may actually feature one of the league's best fronts when it comes to stopping the run.

Ben Roethlisberger is completely hopeless. Some of his interceptions were simply pitiful. Not sure how somebody could zip-line a ball straight to a linebacker after navigating through a three-man pass rush, but Ben managed to pull that off.

The best part of the Steelers offense may be rookie tailback Najee Harris.

Pittsburgh's defenders aren't as stout, especially up front. The defensive line is missing some serious juice. I'm not sure why either - maybe TJ Watt and Tyson Alualu were instrumental to the line performing as well as it did in the past? Whatever the case, Melvin Ingram and Cameron Hayward aren't doing nearly enough holding things down in their absence.
