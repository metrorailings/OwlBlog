## Dolphins @ Jaguars

The Dolphins revert to some very conservative play-calling after running up a lead.

The Dolphins defense decided to abandon their man coverage scheme tonight in favor of cover-3/4 shells. It's paid off, as the Jaguars offense has been thrown off its game significantly.

Chan Gailey is just painfully conservative so long as he's carrying a lead. Fitzpatrick's only thrown a handful of balls in the second half. Gaaaay.

## Cowboys @ Seahawks

Seahawks are really relying on strong safety blitzes to generate pressure. Cowboys are doing well picking up those blitzes so far.

Aldon Smith showing potential.

This Dallas team not showing much of anything to start this game. Preparation is seriously lacking. Why did I pick this team again?

Seattle's turf is tripping up players on both teams.
