## Dolphins @ Jaguars

The Dolphins revert to some very conservative play-calling after running up a lead.

The Dolphins defense decided to abandon their man coverage scheme tonight in favor of cover-3/4 shells. It's paid off, as the Jaguars offense has been thrown off its game significantly.

Chan Gailey is just painfully conservative so long as he's carrying a lead. Fitzpatrick's only thrown a handful of balls in the second half.
