## Dolphins @ Jaguars

The Dolphins revert to some very conservative play-calling after running up a lead.

The Dolphins defense decided to abandon their man coverage scheme tonight in favor of cover-3/4 shells. It's paid off, as the Jaguars offense has been thrown off its game significantly.

Chan Gailey is just painfully conservative so long as he's carrying a lead. Fitzpatrick's only thrown a handful of balls in the second half. Gaaaay.

## Cowboys @ Seahawks

Seahawks are really relying on strong safety blitzes to generate pressure. Cowboys are doing well picking up those blitzes so far.

Aldon Smith showing potential working in tandem with DeMarcus Lawrence.

This Dallas team not showing much of anything to start this game. Preparation is seriously lacking. Why did I pick this team again?

Seattle's turf has tripped up players on both teams a few times.

Dallas is truly an awful team on offense. The Cowboys have no juice on offense. And where are the second half adjustments? I don't understand. You know damn well the Seahawks are going to be blitzing you on every other down and your response to that is GUH.

These Cowboys are committing way too many stupid mistakes across the board. Special teams, secondary, quarterback, tailback....this team has no commitment to excellence.

It's the big plays and the pass rush keeping these worthless Cowboys in contention, otherwise Seattle would have ran away with this dumb game eons ago.

This Dallas offense has no real spirit outside of the young players. The veterans though...what's wrong with them?

Jamal Adams may have injured himself after tripping on the turf. The turf monster up in Century Link is a scary dude.

Horrendous clock management by the Seahawks. Seattle was too excited to put up a score. The Seahawks are loaded with too much testosterone sometimes.

In the end, Seattle had swagger and Dallas didn't. Seattle's defense of no-names managed to out-play Dallas and its big-name players.

Amari Cooper was strangely absent on a drive...?

## Packers @ Saints

A well-executed Saint blitz killed a very promising Packers drive.

So far, seems like Green Bay has fully bought in to Matt LaFuck's system of zone runs and bootlegs. Rodgers and the offense are out there executing well so far.

Guarding against the run remains very much a problem for the Green Bay defense. Some solid coaching from Sean Payton though, emphasizing the running game knowing full well Green Bay's not built to stone rushing plays.

## Titans @ Vikings

Vikings playing with some serious juice in this game given that they have yet to win a game this season.

Kirk Cousins may have found the next Stefon Diggs in rookie Justin Jefferson.

Titans enjoy their three-man pass rush quite a bit as well. Why is this starting to become a thing? I don't understand.

The Kubiak brand of play-action football is producing some serious dividends here now that Justin Jefferson is there as a complimentary receiver alongside Adam Thielan.

The Vikings defensive line stepped up and won three downs in a row after a critical turnover by Kirk Cousins set the Titans up nicely.

Dalvin Cook is something special. His speed, his elusiveness, his burst...

Right side of the Viking offensive line may present itself as a liability.

Derrick Henry has started asserting himself as a physical runner.

Titans starting to line up in five-man fronts, likely in response to the Vikings and their bootlegging tendencies.

Vikings have some exotic blitzes in their defensive playbook.

## Chiefs @ Ravens

Ravens cannot play from negative game script. Lamar is not a pocket passer - his reads are late and his accuracy needs work. Lamar's ability is positively correlated with his team's momentum.

The Chiefs defense is playing very well at all levels. Defensive linemen pressuring Jackson, linebackers reading plays, and and defensive backs executing well enough on man coverage.

Ravens don't have much juice, committing careless mistakes either killing drives early or gifting more yards to the Chiefs.

Chiefs have ended three consecutive drives with essentially turn-overs - a missed field goal, a fumble, and downs. On the drive that ended on downs, three of those downs were spent on running the ball. The Ravens have done a decent job keying in against the run.

Again, the Chiefs are having a hard time trying to force the ground game against these Ravens.

Three straight runs inside the red zone followed by one improved passing play and a well-designed trick play ends in a score for the Chiefs.

Lamar Jackson doomed that last gasp drive from the Ravens with his petulance, his inability to remain composed against blitzes, and his inaccurate throws.

***

## Panthers @ Chargers

Austin Ekeler is something special.

One Panthers drive was defined almost exclusively by a committee of halfbacks. Carolina seems intent on setting a ground game in place before anything else.

Extremely sloppy penalty by Los Angeles extended a Panthers touchdown drive.

Herbert has had a few crisp throws so far, but his offensive line is giving away to three-man pass rushes, of all things.

Panthers actually seem to have an affinity for the three-man defensive front. Interesting. They'll learn the hard way this is not a sustainable strategy.

Panthers passing offense is predicated on easy throws for Teddy. I want to see some more deep throws here. Bridgewater is capable of being more than a game manager!

Chargers aren't showing much juice on offense...

Herbert's accuracy is suspect. Consistency may not be his thing...

Bad series of plays called in the red zone led to the Chargers depressingly settling for a field goal.

Finally a big pass from Teddy.

Carolina's not afraid to run those blitzes against a rookie quarterback.

***

## Lions @ Cardinals

Kyler forcing passes into tight coverage resulting in interceptions. I wonder if an opportunistic zone defense is his weakness.

Detroit showing off some of the creativity in their playbook.

Cardinals may be weak against the run.

The Cardinals and their crossing routes in five-man sets have been destroying this Lions defense.

Kyler Murray and his mobility can definitely be considered an added dimension to this offense.

Lions with a very successful two-minute drive to close out the first half.
