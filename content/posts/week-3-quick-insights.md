## Titans @ Jaguars

The Jaguars insist on running a zone coverage scheme that forces their linebackers to run around the field and even blanket receivers at times. It's not good when Jacksonville has a slow bunch of linebackers outside of Myles Jack.

Jacksonville is still trying to build an offensive identity around Leonard Fournette instead of the passing game. The Titans are keying in on Fournette though, stalling the Jaguars anemic offense.

Mariota sucks.

The Titans will run that ball with reckless abandon until it works, dammit.

Minshew seems to like throwing his deep balls outside the numbers.

## Ravens @ Chiefs

The Chiefs are hopeless at rushing the passer. Chris Jones is the only quality pass rusher on that team. Frank Clark hasn't been living up to his billing.

Michael Lombardi may be right - this Ravens offense has a hard time recovering from negative plays.

Once again, horrendous clock management from Andy Reid as the first half winds down.

Gus Edwards has been beastly, breaking tackles and accelerating quickly.

Ravens offense adjusted in the second half by hammering the ball on the ground. First drive was nothing but runs. It's clear the Chiefs prioritized defending the pass here.

I have to review why the Ravens defense was unable to pressure Mahomes after the first quarter.

Chiefs should have covered. But two lucky heaves by Lamar Jackson kept the Ravens within one score. Goddammit. Ravens are a team with fight though.

## Giants @ Buccaneers

Daniel Jones can run with the ball. Offensive playbook even has designed runs for him.

Janoris Jenkins is not an elite corner.

In the second half, Giants defense has shifted to a two-safety look with man coverage underneath. It seems to be enough to keep Jameis from moving the ball on them at will.

Also worth noting - Jameis sucks. Buccaneers need to get rid of him. Maybe even trade up for Justin Herbert or whatever his name is.

Winston would be murdered by a team with a solid pass rush, the way he holds on to the ball. His pocket presence is horrendous.

Shaq Barrett something special. Buccaneers made a solid pick-up in free agency here. 

Daniel Jones holds on to the ball like a damn fool too.

Buccaneers playing prevent defense on the Giants on the last drive was their downfall. Credit to Daniel Jones for picking apart their weak defensive scheme. And credit to the Giants for stunting the Buccaneers' offense somehow. I need to review tape here...
