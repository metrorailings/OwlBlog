## Titans @ Jaguars

The Jaguars insist on running a zone coverage scheme that forces their linebackers to run around the field and even blanket receivers at times. It's not good when Jacksonville has a slow bunch of linebackers outside of Myles Jack.

Jacksonville is still trying to build an offensive identity around Leonard Fournette instead of the passing game. The Titans are keying in on Fournette though, stalling the Jaguars anemic offense.

Mariota sucks.

The Titans will run that ball with reckless abandon until it works, dammit.

Minshew seems to like throwing his deep balls outside the numbers.

## Ravens @ Chiefs

The Chiefs are hopeless at rushing the passer. Chris Jones is the only quality pass rusher on that team. Frank Clark hasn't been living up to his billing.

Michael Lombardi may be right - this Ravens offense has a hard time recovering from negative plays.

Once again, horrendous clock management from Andy Reid as the first half winds down.

Gus Edwards has been beastly, breaking tackles and accelerating quickly.

Ravens offense adjusted in the second half by hammering the ball on the ground. First drive was nothing but runs. It's clear the Chiefs prioritized defending the pass here.

I have to review why the Ravens defense was unable to pressure Mahomes after the first quarter.

Chiefs should have covered. But two lucky heaves by Lamar Jackson kept the Ravens within one score. Goddammit. Ravens are a team with fight though.

## Lions @ Eagles

Outside zone runs may be effective against Detroit's bigger, slower front.

Detroit runs quite a bit of 11 personnel for a team that's reputedly run-heavy.

Philly's secondary is lousy. Darby especially has lost some of his touch. Not good when the top cornerback on your roster fails to perform adequately.

## Giants @ Buccaneers

Daniel Jones can run with the ball. Offensive playbook even has designed runs for him.

Janoris Jenkins is not an elite corner.

In the second half, Giants defense has shifted to a two-safety look with man coverage underneath. It seems to be enough to keep Jameis from moving the ball on them at will.

Also worth noting - Jameis sucks. Buccaneers need to get rid of him. Maybe even trade up for Justin Herbert or whatever his name is.

Winston would be murdered by a team with a solid pass rush, the way he holds on to the ball. His pocket presence is horrendous.

Shaq Barrett something special. Buccaneers made a solid pick-up in free agency here. 

Daniel Jones holds on to the ball like a damn fool too.

Buccaneers playing prevent defense on the Giants on the last drive was their downfall. Credit to Daniel Jones for picking apart their weak defensive scheme. And credit to the Giants for stunting the Buccaneers' offense somehow. I need to review tape here...

## Rams @ Browns

Browns have serious issues guarding shifty receivers.

Cooper Kupp is the best receiver on the Rams.

Wade Phillips adjusted quickly on defense. Rams defense were embarrassed on a long third down when a blitz left them helpless to defend against a halfback screen. The second time the Browns tried to pull off the same trick, a linebacker shadowed the Browns tailback and took him down before the screen was even set.

Browns made a bizarre call on a fourth and long, calling a draw run. Just idiotic.

Goff's play clock management on the road is just poor. Waiting too long to call for the snap. Nearly cost the Rams a first down when McVay called a time-out immediately before the ball was snapped on what actually ended up being a successful throw to move the chains.

Baker Mayfield having to hold on to the ball and manufacture a play is not a pretty sight. Plays have to unfold like they're drawn up in order for the Browns signal caller to be successful.

The Browns lack any creative red zone plays to try and make an emergency touchdown.

Once again, the Browns' lack of discipline at preventing penalties kept some Ram drives alive or more fruitful.

## Texans @ Chargers

Texans secondary is still incredibly problematic. The off coverage in particular is worrying.

DJ Reader stepping up as a solid pass rusher.

Gus Bradley does not have much of a taste for blitzes, apparently. In fact, he may have more of a liking for three-man rushes than for blitzes, sadly.

## Panthers @ Cardinals

Kyler Murray being able to run off the read option seems to be an important part of the Cardinals offense.

Cardinals seem to be more prone to using wide receiver screens as part of their otherwise barebones red zone package.

Kyle Allen playing well, especially under pressure. Keeps his eyes down the field.

Carolina has a package of reverses in their offensive repertoire. One example is a two-layered wide receiver sweep.

Mario Addison with a timely sack to end a Cardinal drive.

Arizona is lousy at defending tight ends.

Kyle Allen's first two touchdowns came from traditional drop-back plays. Impressive.

Carolina's secondary is playing very well. Quite disciplined in their zone coverage.
