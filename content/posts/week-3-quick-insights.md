## Titans @ Jaguars

The Jaguars insist on running a zone coverage scheme that forces their linebackers to run around the field and even blanket receivers at times. It's not good when Jacksonville has a slow bunch of linebackers outside of Myles Jack.

Jacksonville is still trying to build an offensive identity around Leonard Fournette instead of the passing game. The Titans are keying in on Fournette though, stalling the Jaguars anemic offense.

Mariota sucks.

The Titans will run that ball with reckless abandon until it works, dammit.

Minshew seems to like throwing his deep balls outside the numbers.

## Ravens @ Chiefs

The Chiefs are hopeless at rushing the passer. Chris Jones is the only quality pass rusher on that team. Frank Clark hasn't been living up to his billing.

Michael Lombardi may be right - this Ravens offense has a hard time recovering from negative plays.

Once again, horrendous clock management from Andy Reid as the first half winds down.

Gus Edwards has been beastly, breaking tackles and accelerating quickly.

Ravens adjusted in the second half by hammering the ball on the ground.
