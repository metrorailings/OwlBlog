### Bears @ Falcons (-3)

> Falcons -3

***

Atlanta simply has too much gas on offense for Chicago to snuff out. If the Falcons start running up the score like last week, I don't think the Bears can keep up.

Then again, these are the Atlanta Falcons. Nobody blows a lead quite like Atlanta. For that reason alone, betting on them as favorites will always give me pause, no matter the quality of the opponent.

### Raiders @ Patriots (-6.5)

> Patriots -6.5

***

Give me the New England Patriots coming off a painful loss against an overhyped Raiders squad. Yes, Las Vegas deserves so much credit for upsetting the Saints last week in their home opener, but to be fair, Drew Brees is no longer the Brees of old, especially without his favorite weapon in Michael Thomas.

The Patriots might not have as much talent as I originally thought, but New England can still frustrate Las Vegas by forcing them to throw deep and outside the numbers, something Derek Carr isn't very comfortable doing. Add on top of that the litany of injuries hindering key playmakers on this team and the Raiders are more probably going to be on the receiving end of a beatdown.

### 49ers @ Giants (+4)

> 49ers -4

***

I hate to bet against my Giants. But New York has very little juice on offense. And San Francisco, as many bodies as they're missing on both sides of the ball, still has a very good coaching staff that can schematically arrange scoring opportunities.

I just cannot see how New York can matriculate the football without the services of their two best skill position players.

***

### Texans @ Steelers (-4)

> Texans +4

***

I'm liking this pick quite a bit, if only because the Steelers present some real vulnerabilities in their pass coverage. As disastrous as Houston has been offensively, the Texans have an opportunity to right the ship here against a Pittsburgh secondary that gave up significant pass yardage against the likes of Daniel Jones and Jeff Driskel (sic?).

It worries me that Pittsburgh can harangue opposing passers into submission. But I have faith in Deshaun Watson here as the better quarterback.

***

### Titans @ Vikings (+2.5)

> Titans -2.5

***

The Vikings are missing way too many critical pieces on defense, especially among their linebacking corps. It's not good considering Ryan Tannehill and the reigning rushing champion are coming into town.

On top of that, I trust Tannehill way more than Cousins. Coaching is more or less a wash here, as both head coaches have proven themselves to be among the upper echelons of the coaching ranks.
