+++
Last week was a terrible week. Getting only two picks right out of five is embarrassing.

But I never saw the Chiefs playing as sloppily as they did against the Chargers. Kansas City isn't getting away with the same type of tricks and improvised plays that rewarded them so richly the past two years - two-deep zone defenses with extra attention paid to Tyreek Hill has effectively declawed this offense. Travis Kelce and the rest of the receivers are able to do some damage, but the explosiveness simply isn't there if Tyreek Hill isn't a factor in the game. Without Hill, Mahomes is holding on to the ball too long now, waiting for other skill players to get open. It's not good when the Chiefs have an offensive line still cutting its teeth as a unit. The Chargers were regularly harassing Mahomes into throwing some ugly balls, two of which were picked off. Defensive, the Chiefs fared better, but Los Angeles' taller receivers were pushing around the secondary without breaking much a sweat - Mike Williams was terrorizing Kansas' defensive backs all game.

I'm such a moron for picking the Jets in the first place. The hell am I doing placing my trust in unproven teams? I genuinely convinced myself New York had some potential after their defense's impressive showing against New England.  Never mind the fact that the offensive line remains a toxic cesspool. Never mind the fact that New England's offensive line is pretty damn horrible in its own right. Against an offensive and defensive fronts worth their weights in salt, the Jets were reduced to a blubbering mess.

The 49ers losing was a lesson in improper analysis. I was convinced the outcome last year between these two franchises was an anomaly. I mean...San Francisco was ravaged by a vicious injury bug. It was so bad that Nick Mullens was forced to seize the reins of the offense after Jimmy Garoppolo fell victim to the bug himself. I convinced myself Kyle Shanahan calling fewer runs than passes was a sort of irrational response to all the bad luck besetting his team.  This time, I told myself...this time, Shanahan would do the right thing and emphasize the ground game. That never happened. Maybe as a result of having to scrape the tar pits to find a serviceable running back to start for them, San Francisco refused to run any of the zone-rushing concepts that were money for them just two years prior. All their rushes were more or less boring runs straight up the middle. It was all too clear Shanahan put the onus of production on Jimmy G's shoulders. Big mistake. Jimmy G is washed up. Dare I say Nick Mullens may have been better in that position than Jimmy G. I can't help but shake my head thinking Garoppalo was a genuine improvement over Mullens.

This week will hopefully be a different story. Quarterbacks will receive far more consideration in my analysis. On top of that, a team needs to demonstrate competence in some measure before I decide to trust them. Sure, that means I'll never be on the cusp of a trend when it first breaks, but it's so much easier riding existing waves than it is trying to figure out where a wave may first appear.

### Seahawks @ 49ers (-3)

#### _Latest Results_

Seahawks @ **Vikings**  
**Packers** @ 49ers

#### _Key Injuries_

TBD

#### History

The Seahawks faced off against the 49ers twice every year as division opponents. Both times last year, Seattle notched the victory. The second match last year is more relevant for discussion here, given its recency and the fact that it took place in San Francisco. Sure, so many of the 49ers key players weren't present due to injury, but as we saw last week against the Packers, it's questionable whether those injuries truly mattered much in the grand scheme of things.

Here's the thing - Seattle has no serious pass rush. Then again, Seattle didn't have much in that department last year as well. Only when they blitz can they consistently mount pressure. Good quarterbacks can dissect blitzes, but thankfully the 49ers have none. It's likely a major reason why the Seahawks swept these Niners last year.

Seahawks +3

**Seattle covers if**  
the 49ers are forced to burden Jimmy Garoppalo with the onus of production. It seems Shanahan doesn't quite trust Trey Sermon with his zone-running concepts, so if the Seahawks can bottle up the 49ers power run game, it'll be up to Jimmy G to once again matriculate the ball downfield. 49er miscues and Seattle's blitzing should give Russell Wilson enough opportunities to marshal scoring drives.

**San Francisco** **covers if**  
their ground game magically comes to life.  
OR  
the return of Nick Bosa and Dee Ford is enough to give San Francisco the extra defensive edge needed to win one over Seattle. Not an easy ask considering Seattle's offense has been unusually productive so far this season, given their yards per play.

### Washington @ Falcons (+1)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Washington @ **Bills**  
**Falcons** @ Giants

#### _Key Injuries_

No injuries of any real concern outside of Washington guard Brandon Scherff, who may be ruled out.

#### _History_

Neither of these teams have met recently, though even if these have met last year, those results would mean very little given Atlanta is inaugurating a new management regime this year.

However, we do have a common opponent that these two have faced in back-to-back weeks - the New York Football Giants. Both teams won, but Atlanta's victory felt more substantive given the Falcons outscored the Giants in their own stadium without any partisan intervention from the referees. The score may indicate the game was more boring, but it was a pretty solid victory for an Atlanta team desperately searching for its first win in the Arthur Smith era.

Falcons +1

**Atlanta covers if**  
Arthur Smith can improve his team's offensive productivity against a Washington defensive unit failing to live up to its billing. Matt Ryan's penchant for short passes can hopefully bear fruit here.

**Washington covers if**  
their venerated defensive line can actually live up to their potential and harangue Matt Ryan all game long.

### Browns @ Vikings (+2)

#### _Latest Results_

Seahawks @ **Vikings**  
Bears @ **Browns**

#### _Key Injuries_

No major injuries, though it's worth keeping an eye on Cleveland's offensive line.

#### History

No relevant history to dive into here. It's probably more instructive to look into the last instance when Minnesota's defense played a top-tier rushing offense. In that spirit, let's look at their Christmas showdown against the Saints last season. Things didn't go well at all for Minnesota that day - Alvin Kamara left them smothered in track marks.

**Cleveland covers if**  
they have more plays with the ball in their possession than the Vikings in what will likely be an offensive spectacle.

**Minnesota covers if**  
they have more plays with the ball in their possession than the Browns in what will likely be an offensive spectacle.

### Steelers @ Packers (-6.5)

#### _Latest Results_

**Bengals** @ Steelers  
**Packers** @ 49ers

#### _Key Injuries_

Seems like the Steelers are healing up on defense, though the offense is a bit concerning now that Ben and his top receivers are all dealing with lingering injuries.

Green Bay may be down a few pieces on offense, but nothing significant.

#### History

No relevant history here given these two teams are located in different conferences. Neither of these teams share any common competitors either.

**Pittsburgh covers if  
**they play angry after a humiliating loss against an underwhelming Cincinnati team...  
AND  
Green Bay comes out gutless and flat following a big win against a conference rival.

**Green Bay covers if**  
they adopt the same strategy this week that was so money for them last week against the 49ers - quick passes, persistent zone running, and Davonte Adams exploiting holes in pass coverage. The Packers also need to play with some intensity here - lackadaisical play won't suffice here against one of the league's best defenses.

### Buccaneers @ Patriots (+6.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Buccaneers @ **Rams**  
**Saints** @ Patriots

#### _Key Injuries_

Tampa Bay has been ravaged by injuries, the most significant of which being the injury to Jason Pierre-Paul. Without JPP, their pass rush lacks that elite book-end opposite Shaq Barrett. Vita Vea can try and pick up the slack, but interior defensive linemen almost never produce on the same level as a first-class edge rusher. So it remains to be seen whether anybody else outside of Shaq Barrett can keep the heat up on Mac Jones. 

Besides JPP, Tampa Bay's secondary is so ragged that the team was forced to sign Richard Sherman to give that unit some experienced depth. Signing Sherman is probably more a sign of desperation though - the man specializes in zone coverage, not the man coverage schemes Todd Bowles prefers to run.

The Patriots aren't exactly a picture of health, but they're in far better shape. James White is out though with a hip injury.  

#### _History_

No recent history between these two teams, but Brady and Belichick know each other all too well, spending the best part of their lives together building a dynasty.

#### _Weather_

Some light rain is possible, but otherwise a pleasant night

Patriots +6.5

***

**New England covers if**  
they emulate the Rams game plan against Tampa Bay. Los Angeles was able to make hay against Tampa's defense by exploiting their tattered secondary and getting rid of the ball fairly quickly. Add on top of that Tampa Bay's mess of injuries and the Patriots could not only cover, but win outright.

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
their defensive front forces some ugly plays from Mac Jones and Brady is able to post up scores regularly against a New England defense still not quite in top form.
