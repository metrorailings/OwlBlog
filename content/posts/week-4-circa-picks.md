+++
Last week was a terrible week. Getting only two picks right out of five is embarrassing.

But I never saw the Chiefs playing as sloppily as they did against the Chargers. Kansas City isn't getting away with the same type of tricks and improvised plays that rewarded them so richly the past two years - two-deep zone defenses with extra attention paid to Tyreek Hill has effectively declawed this offense. Travis Kelce and the rest of the receivers are able to do some damage, but the explosiveness simply isn't there if Tyreek Hill isn't a factor in the game. Without Hill, Mahomes is holding on to the ball too long now, waiting for other skill players to get open. It's not good when the Chiefs have an offensive line still cutting its teeth as a unit. The Chargers were regularly harassing Mahomes into throwing some ugly balls, two of which were picked off. Defensive, the Chiefs fared better, but Los Angeles' taller receivers were pushing around the secondary without breaking much a sweat - Mike Williams was terrorizing Kansas' defensive backs all game.

I'm such a moron for picking the Jets in the first place. The hell am I doing placing my trust in unproven teams? I genuinely convinced myself New York had some potential after their defense's impressive showing against New England.  Never mind the fact that the offensive line remains a toxic cesspool. Never mind the fact that New England's offensive line is pretty damn horrible in its own right. Against an offensive and defensive fronts worth their weights in salt, the Jets were reduced to a blubbering mess.

The 49ers losing was a lesson in improper analysis. I was convinced the outcome last year between these two franchises was an anomaly. I mean...San Francisco was ravaged by a vicious injury bug. It was so bad that Nick Mullens was forced to seize the reins of the offense after Jimmy Garoppolo fell victim to the bug himself. I convinced myself Kyle Shanahan calling fewer runs than passes was a sort of irrational response to all the bad luck besetting his team.  This time, I told myself...this time, Shanahan would do the right thing and emphasize the ground game. That never happened. Maybe as a result of having to scrape the tar pits to find a serviceable running back to start for them, San Francisco refused to run any of the zone-rushing concepts that were money for them just two years prior. All their rushes were more or less boring runs straight up the middle. It was all too clear Shanahan put the onus of production on Jimmy G's shoulders. Big mistake. Jimmy G is washed up. Dare I say Nick Mullens may have been better in that position than Jimmy G. I can't help but shake my head thinking Garoppalo was a genuine improvement over Mullens.

This week will hopefully be a different story. Quarterbacks will receive far more consideration in my analysis. On top of that, a team needs to demonstrate competence in some measure before I decide to trust them. Sure, that means I'll never be on the cusp of a trend when it first breaks, but it's so much easier riding existing waves than it is trying to figure out where a wave may first appear.

#### History

The Seahawks faced off against the 49ers twice every year as division opponents. Both times last year, Seattle notched the victory. The second match last year is more relevant for discussion here, given its recency and the fact that it took place in San Francisco. Sure, so many of the 49ers key players weren't present due to injury, but as we saw last week against the Packers, it's questionable whether those injuries truly mattered much in the grand scheme of things. 

Here's the thing - Seattle has no serious pass rush. Then again, Seattle didn't have much last year as well. Only when they blitz can they consistently mount pressure. Good quarterbacks can dissect blitzes, but thankfully the 49ers have none. It's likely a major reason why the Seahawks swept these Niners last year.

Summery and clear

**Seattle covers if**  
the 49ers are forced to burden Jimmy Garoppalo with the onus of production. It seems Shanahan doesn't quite trust Trey Sermon with his zone-running concepts, so if the Seahawks can bottle up the 49ers power run game, it'll be up to Jimmy G to once again matriculate the ball downfield. 49er miscues and Seattle's blitzing should give Russell Wilson enough opportunities to marshal scoring drives

**San Francisco** **covers if**  
their ground game magically comes to life  
OR  
the return of Nick Bosa and Dee Ford is enough to give San Francisco the extra edge needed to win one over Seattle.
