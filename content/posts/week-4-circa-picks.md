+++
Last week was a terrible week. Getting only two picks right out of five is embarrassing.

But I never saw the Chiefs playing as sloppily as they did against the Chargers. Kansas City isn't getting away with the same type of tricks and improvised plays that rewarded them so richly the past two years - two-deep zone defenses with extra attention paid to Tyreek Hill has effectively declawed this offense. Travis Kelce and the rest of the receivers are able to do some damage, but the explosiveness simply isn't there if Tyreek Hill isn't a factor in the game. Without Hill, Mahomes is holding on to the ball too long now, waiting for other skill players to get open. It's not good when the Chiefs have an offensive line still cutting its teeth as a unit. The Chargers were regularly harassing Mahomes into throwing some ugly balls, two of which were picked off. Defensive, the Chiefs fared better, but Los Angeles' taller receivers were pushing around the secondary without breaking much a sweat - Mike Williams was terrorizing Kansas' defensive backs all game.

I'm such a moron for picking the Jets in the first place. The hell am I doing placing my trust in unproven teams? I genuinely convinced myself New York had some potential after their defense's impressive showing against New England.  Never mind the fact that the offensive line remains a toxic cesspool. Never mind the fact that New England's offensive line is pretty damn horrible in its own right. Against an offensive and defensive fronts worth their weights in salt, the Jets were reduced to a blubbering mess.

The 49ers losing was a lesson in improper analysis. I was convinced the outcome last year between these two franchises was an anomaly. I mean...San Francisco was ravaged by a vicious injury bug. It was so bad that Nick Mullens was forced to seize the reins of the offense after Jimmy Garoppolo fell victim to the bug himself. I convinced myself Kyle Shanahan calling fewer runs than passes was a sort of irrational response to all the bad luck besetting his team.  This time, I told myself...this time, Shanahan would do the right thing and emphasize the ground game. That never happened. Maybe as a result of having to scrape the tar pits to find a serviceable running back to start for them, San Francisco refused to run any of the zone-rushing concepts that were money for them just two years prior. All their rushes were more or less boring runs straight up the middle. It was all too clear Shanahan put the onus of production on Jimmy G's shoulders. Big mistake. Jimmy G is washed up. Dare I say Nick Mullens may have been better in that position than Jimmy G. I can't help but shake my head thinking Garoppalo was a genuine improvement over Mullens.

This week will hopefully be a different story. Quarterbacks will receive far more consideration in my analysis. On top of that, a team needs to demonstrate competence in some measure before I decide to trust them. Sure, that means I'll never be on the cusp of a trend when it first breaks, but it's so much easier riding existing waves than it is trying to figure out where a wave may first appear.

### Seahawks @ 49ers (-2.5)

#### _Latest Results_

Seahawks @ **Vikings**  
**Packers** @ 49ers

#### _Key Injuries_

Dalvin Cook isn't practicing for the Vikings. Not good to see their best offensive player unable to even practice on a limited basis by Thursday.

#### History

Both these teams met last year in a close-fought match. Dalvin Cook was balling out and led Minnesota to an early lead, but the Seahawks were able to rally in the second half, edging the Vikings out in a one point victory.

#### _Weather_

Dome game, it doesn't matter.

**Minnesota covers if**  
they own time of possession through a ground game led by Dalvin Cook. Russell can't cook if he only has so much time in the kitchen.  
OR  
Mike Zimmer scares his men into outperforming in order to avoid a three-game hole.

**Seattle covers if**  
they can regroup after a disastrous outing against Derrick Henry and keep Cook in check through their base cover-three defense. The Seahawks need to put the onus of production on Kirk Cousin's shoulders. If they do that, Russell Wilson will have enough opportunities to score himself. And if Wilson can run his scrambles as effectively as Kyler Murray did last week against these Minnesota boys, Seattle should be able to net enough points on offense to win this game.
