Last week was a terrible week. Getting only two picks right out of five is embarrassing.

But I never saw the Chiefs playing as sloppily as they did against the Chargers. Kansas City isn't getting away with the same type of tricks and improvised plays that rewarded them so richly the past two years - two-deep zone defenses with extra attention paid to Tyreek Hill has effectively declawed this offense. Travis Kelce and the rest of the receivers are able to do some damage, but the explosiveness simply isn't there if Tyreek Hill isn't a factor in the game. Without Hill, Mahomes is holding on to the ball too long now, waiting for other skill players to get open. It's not good when the Chiefs have an offensive line still cutting its teeth as a unit. The Chargers were regularly harassing Mahomes into throwing some ugly balls, two of which were picked off. Defensive, the Chiefs fared better, but Los Angeles' taller receivers were pushing around the secondary without breaking much a sweat - Mike Williams was terrorizing Kansas' defensive backs all game.
