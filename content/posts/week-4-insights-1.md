## Giants @ Saints

Daniel Jones is a real one. As dysfunctional as this Giants team can be, Daniel Jones is not a point of weakness on this team.

Sean Payton coming out with a phenomenal drive in the second half, having Winston throw the deep ball on a sideline fly route, followed by Taysom Hill running the ball with power straight up the gut of the Giants defense. Payton likely saw the Giants playing a little too aggressively in the box and decided the deep backfield was open for business.

Now that the Giants are playing defensive backs deeper, Payton is compensating by calling more running plays.

Kadarius Toney, Kenny Golladay, and John Ross came up big in this game for the Giants. Well done.

Saints love playing so much outside technique with their corners.

## Browns @ Vikings

Baker Mayfield not playing drop back football well in a two-minute situation.

## Steelers @ Packers

Diontae Johnson a significant player for the Steelers offense.

Randall Cobb playing a huge role here in converting third downs.

More importantly...it seems like Green Bay is finally chipping edge rushers! Finally!

Green Bay's ground game isn't necessarily built off the raw strength, but on lateral speed. The lateral quickness is what's opening lanes for these halfbacks.

Ben is a corpse out there. No mobility, no accuracy, no touch. Get him out of there. Might as well experiment with your depth quarterbacks, as this is almost assuredly a lost year for the Steelers.

Let this be a lesson that Green Bay can execute even against big underdogs. Also, betting on "stock low" teams aren't advisable so long as the quarterback is a massive liability.

## Buccaneers @ Patriots

Patriot defense seriously struggling against the rushing attack.

Jones failed to read the blitz on a 3rd down, leading to an interception. Mac Jones needs to get better if the Patriots expect him to set his own protections.

Is it possible Tampa Bay's man style of pass coverage is opening up too many lanes in the middle? All of Mac Jones money throws have been between the hashes, usually to Kendrick Bourne.

Josh McDaniels with some solid adjustments and good use of the hurry-up offense. If only he'd be more creative with his ground game....incorporate some pseudo-run concepts in there.

Is Brady not good throwing in the rain? Four of his passes have soared past his receivers.

## Colts @ Dolphins

Colts defense using a combination of cover two and man coverage.

Miami's offensive line is truly awful. First, it can't get any push whatsoever in the ground game. Second, pass protection is an absolute trainwreck. Indianapolis' offensive line may be a wretched mess, but even in its current state, it stands above Miami's.

Miami's defense is throwing single-high safety man coverage hard against Indy. Unfortunately, this scheme is leaving the box seriously undermanned. It seems to be a conscientious decision made by Miami's coaches, perhaps in an attempt to force Carson Wentz to hold on to the ball an extra few ticks so that the pass rush can hit home. It doesn't matter though...the Colts are taking sweet advantage here by running the ball hard. And even though Indy's offensive line is shit, their running game still has some juice. It's sustained them on their scoring drives.

Carson Wentz seems so much more willing to throw the ball underneath at least. His pocket presence has gotten better, though he's been sacked a few times.
