## Giants @ Saints

Daniel Jones is a real one. As dysfunctional as this Giants team can be, Daniel Jones is not a point of weakness on this team.

Sean Payton coming out with a phenomenal drive in the second half, having Winston throw the deep ball on a sideline fly route, followed by Taysom Hill running the ball with power straight up the gut of the Giants defense. Payton likely saw the Giants playing a little too aggressively in the box and decided the deep backfield was open for business.

Now that the Giants are playing defensive backs deeper, Payton is compensating by calling more running plays.

Kadarius Toney, Kenny Golladay, and John Ross came up big in this game for the Giants. Well done.

Saints love playing so much outside technique with their corners.

## Browns @ Vikings

Baker Mayfield not playing drop back football well in a two-minute situation.

## Steelers @ Packers

Diontae Johnson a significant player for the Steelers offense.

Randall Cobb playing a huge role here in converting third downs.

More importantly...it seems like Green Bay is finally chipping edge rushers! Finally!

Green Bay's ground game isn't necessarily built off the raw strength, but on lateral speed. The lateral quickness is what's opening lanes for these halfbacks.

Ben is a corpse out there. No mobility, no accuracy, no touch. Get him out of there. Might as well experiment with your depth quarterbacks, as this is almost assuredly a lost year for the Steelers.

Let this be a lesson that Green Bay can execute even against big underdogs. Also, betting on "stock low" teams aren't advisable so long as the quarterback is a massive liability.

## Buccaneers @ Patriots

Patriot defense seriously struggling against the rushing attack.
