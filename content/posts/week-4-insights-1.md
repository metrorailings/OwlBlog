## Giants @ Saints

Daniel Jones is a real one. As dysfunctional as this Giants team can be, Daniel Jones is not a point of weakness on this team.

Sean Payton coming out with a phenomenal drive in the second half, having Winston throw the deep ball on a sideline fly route, followed by Taysom Hill running the ball with power straight up the gut of the Giants defense. Payton likely saw the Giants playing a little too aggressively in the box and decided the deep backfield was open for business.

Now that the Giants are playing defensive backs deeper, Payton is compensating by calling more running plays.

Kadarius Toney, Kenny Golladay, and John Ross came up big in this game for the Giants. Well done.

Saints love playing so much outside technique with their corners.

## Browns @ Vikings

Baker Mayfield not playing drop back football well in a two-minute situation.
