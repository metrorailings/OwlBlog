## Chargers @ Buccaneers

***

Justin Herbert may be the real thing. His passes have been on point and his poise has been admirable so far.

Tom Brady, on the other hand....maybe it's time to put him out to pasture. It's sad.

Tampa Bay's players committing some silly penalties, some of it because of anger, some of it because of procedural ignorance. 

Heavier sets seem to be doing wonders for Tampa Bay's offense. I wonder if the Chargers pass rushers were throwing Brady way off his game...

Justin Herbert with a big pass leading to a score against a jailbreak blitz. Well done.

In the second half, Brady is dead set on testing this Chargers secondary deep. His intended air yards have to be well into the double-digits here. Tampa Bay has to be convinced that the Chargers defensive backfield is a pointed area of weakness.

Tampa Bay with a late drive intended to drain clock. Bruce Arians isn't quite that interested in running up the score in this particular affair.

The haze blitz messed with Justin Herbert and fooled him into throwing an interception to close out the game.
