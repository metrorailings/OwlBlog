## Chargers @ Buccaneers

***

Justin Herbert may be the real thing. His passes have been on point and his poise has been admirable so far.

Tom Brady, on the other hand....maybe it's time to put him out to pasture. It's sad.

Tampa Bay's players committing some silly penalties, some of it because of anger, some of it because of procedural ignorance.

Heavier sets seem to be doing wonders for Tampa Bay's offense. I wonder if the Chargers pass rushers were throwing Brady way off his game...

Justin Herbert with a big pass leading to a score against a jailbreak blitz. Well done.

In the second half, Brady is dead set on testing this Chargers secondary deep. His intended air yards have to be well into the double-digits here. Tampa Bay has to be convinced that the Chargers defensive backfield is a pointed area of weakness.

Tampa Bay with a late drive intended to drain clock. Bruce Arians isn't quite that interested in running up the score in this particular affair.

The haze blitz messed with Justin Herbert and fooled him into throwing an interception to close out the game.

## Bills @ Raiders

Derek Carr with some poor passes ultimately left the Raiders having to settle for a field goal. Very disappointing short pass on 3rd and long too.

Gruden passing up on a chance to show confidence in his offense by kicking the field goal on a fourth and short.

Bills have some serious juice across the organization. Buffalo is genuinely having good fun playing football.

Brian Daboll drawing up some creative plays and Josh Allen executing them well. Compare this offense to whatever mess the Giants run and this is yet another strong argument in favor of year-over-year continuity.

## Saints @ Lions

Matt Patricia is only putting six men in the box against Drew Brees. I expected way too much from Patricia here. 

Literal six-man boxes against Alvin Kamara and the Saints offensive line. How is Patricia this bad a coach?

On top of that, Detroit's defensive tackles are a soft bunch. Pushed around pretty easily.

Stocking up on Patriot rejects is not a good way to build a roster, Matt.
