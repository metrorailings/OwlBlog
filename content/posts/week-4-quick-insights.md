## Jaguars @ Broncos

Jaguar linebackers not playing disciplined against misdirection plays.

Jacksonville doesn't seem to have much of a red zone playbook.

Jalen Ramsey's understudy not doing all too well. But in his defense, the Broncos were able to move the ball on him thanks more to some well-drawn plays. 

Those plays involved wide receivers running crossing routes on third down in order to create space for a halfback coming out of the field, running play-action off a heavy formation, and then motioning a tailback away from the pocket in order to create a throwing lane up the seam for Flacco.

## Cowboys @ Saints

The Saints should have a hard time running their offense from a negative game script, given Bridgewater is more a game manager than anything else.
