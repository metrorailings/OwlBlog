## Jaguars @ Broncos

Jaguar linebackers not playing disciplined against misdirection plays.

Jacksonville doesn't seem to have much of a red zone playbook.

Jalen Ramsey's understudy not doing all too well. But in his defense, the Broncos were able to move the ball on him thanks largely to some well-drawn plays. 

Those plays involved wide receivers running crossing routes on third down in order to create space for a halfback coming out of the backfield, running play-action off a heavy formation, and then motioning a tailback away from the pocket in order to create a throwing lane up the seam for Flacco.

The Jaguars' offensive tackles are points of weakness.

Fournette was able to chew off some serious yardage early in the second half behind the I-formation fullback runs.

Minshew is magical with his elusiveness in the pocket.

Timely zone blitz by the Jaguars to end a critical Broncos drive.

Minshew magic is a real thing. This whole team ups its game when Minshew magic is in effect.

Zone blitzes throw off the Broncos and their attempt to dump off passes to leaking halfbacks.

## Cowboys @ Saints

The Saints should have a hard time running their offense from a negative game script, given Bridgewater is more a game manager than anything else.
