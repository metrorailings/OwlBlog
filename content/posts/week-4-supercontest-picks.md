### Cardinals @ Panthers (+3.5)

> Panthers +3.5

***

Kyler Murray is still working through growing pains in his second year as a starting quarterback in the league. If the Panthers can force some errors from him, a win is not outside the realm of possibility.

Granted, Carolina's offense is pretty uninspiring. Teddy Bridgewater will never take over a game, and I wonder whether he can muster a comeback should the Panthers fall behind. Then again, the same might be said of a Cardinals team missing its two most explosive weapons in Christian Kirk and DeAndre Hopkins.

### Saints @ Lions (+4)

> Lions +4

***

I'm wary of this pick. I actually think it's not all too difficult to conceive a defensive game plan against a Saints offense missing the deep vertical dimension to its passing attack. The problem is Matt Patricia is the head coach of this team. And Patricia is the exact kind of coach to fuck up here, even with the proper plan in place.

His game against the Rams two years ago perfectly illustrates his commitment to failure - even though his defensive game plan was masterfully formulated, the Lions still didn't end up covering as double-digit underdogs.

It does help that the Saints are missing key weapons on offense and two starting defensive backs in their secondary. So I offer up the Lions here, albeit only lukewarmly.

***

### Vikings @ Texans (-4.5)

> Vikings +4.5

***

Oddsmakers expect this game to be a high-scoring one, as both offenses carry some serious potential, especially going up against defenses as underwhelming as the two being fielded here.

I'm not too sure about that. The Texans offense has been incredibly lackluster without a true big play threat in DeAndre Hopkins and a coach that wants nothing more than to handcuff his star quarterback. Granted, Minnesota's defense has been disappointing in its own right, but a part of their struggle can be owed to inexperience. It's a problem Mike Zimmer will gradually correct over the course of this season. While I don't expect the defensive backs to adjust swimmingly this week, I do expect some improvement from them regardless, especially against a Texans offense missing an identity.

Don't overlook the Vikings here on offense as well. While Deshaun Watson is the better quarterback, Minnesota's offense is arguably stocked with better talent at all other levels.

***

### Seahawks @ Dolphins (+6.5)

> Dolphins +6.5

***

I hate betting against Russell Wilson and his fiery Seahawks, especially coming off two statement wins. But those wins were emotionally and physically taxing - the Seahawks need a proper week to reset themselves, meaning an underwhelming game is very possible here. What better moment to underperform than in a cross-country match against a middling Miami team that impresses nobody? The humidity won't be helping things either.

On top of that, Seattle's defense will be missing its most vital cornerstone in Jamal Adams. Maybe Quandre Diggs can step up in his absence, but that seems unlikely given all the different roles Adams played in this defense. More than likely, the Seahawks will be replacing Jamal Adams with Ryan Neal, a street-level player off their practice squad. Expectations for this defense are incriminating low given all the yards they've given up to Cam Newton and Dak Prescott over the past two weeks, so things don't look promising against a Miami offense with some moxie.

***

### Chargers @ Buccaneers (-7)

> Buccaneers -7

***

Seven points is a lot to ask for an unfinished Tampa Bay offense. But this contest play is predicated more on Todd Bowles and his assortment of blitzes throwing a rookie quarterback off balance. Given the sorry state of the Chargers offensive line and the humid weather bearing down on the field that day, Justin Herbert will likely spend most of the day negotiating through shrinking pockets and free blitzers.

So long as Tampa Bay can give Tom Brady and his squad enough possessions, a cover is very much a possibility.

***

### Ravens @ Football Team (+13)

> Ravens -13

***

Yet another wide spread here. But the Ravens are that type of team that either beat you big or lose big. And there's no way in hell they're losing to the Washington Former Slurs so long as Dwayne Haskins remains the team's quarterback.

***

### Eagles @ 49ers (-7)

> 49ers -7

***

Talk about a team coming off a smoking high playing a team clawing its way out of an abysmally low point. Conventional wisdom would say the latter team is due for a surprising performance. But the Eagles are even more hopeless than your typical loser. Something about their coaching and their players gives me the impression that the team has given up on contending. Their willingness to accept the draw last week against the lowly Bengals will never sit right with me.

It's that reason and Kyle Shanahan's ability to pull great performances out of this team that make me want to side with the 49ers here. Still...in general, it's never wise to bet against a team at their lowest point. The spread is overly skewed because of that perception that the Eagles are truly horrendous.
