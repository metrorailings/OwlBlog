How did I deny my hunches from last week? As well as that little point about quarterbacks I mentioned in my opening words last week.

If I went with my hunches, I'd likely be 5-0. Washington, Green Bay, and Cleveland covered. Why? Likely because all three of those teams had better quarterbacks than the teams they were fighting. Yet, I took a risk on Atlanta and backed out of the Packers and Browns games entirely. Instead, I went with the disgustingly hopeless Miami Dolphins.
