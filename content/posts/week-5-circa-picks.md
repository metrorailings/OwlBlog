How did I deny my hunches from last week? As well as that little point about quarterbacks I mentioned in my opening words last week.

If I went with my hunches, I'd likely be 5-0. Washington, Green Bay, and Cleveland covered. Why? Likely because all three of those teams had better (or equal) quarterbacks compared to the teams they were fighting. Yet, I took a risk on Atlanta and backed out of the Packers and Browns games entirely. Instead, I went with the disgustingly hopeless Miami Dolphins. Jacoby Brissett was a goddamn mess in this game. It's bad enough his offensive line does nothing but flap around aimlessly the wind, but his tendency to hold the ball in the pocket only exacerbates the team's woes on offense. A cardboard offensive line combined with a slow-acting quarterback leads to nothing but futility for any offense - and for the first three quarters, the Dolphins were the poster child for this type of futility. Any production that came in the fourth quarter came as a result of the Colts defense playing soft once victory was all but certain.

The Falcons nearly covered. But ultimately, the Washingtonians (under the leadership of one Taylor Heinecke) fought just hard enough to steal the win. Still, Atlanta performed well and from a statistical standpoint, Matt Ryan played decent. It was a game that could have gone either way. With a bit more luck, I would have won this game and ended the week on a 4-1 high.

This week, things are a bit more interesting. History won't play as big a role this week given none of the non-divisional games involve teams that have faced each other recently. Instead, quarterbacks and coaching will be emphasized here.

#### _Key Injuries_

Tampa Bay may still be without Rob Gronkowski. Without Gronk, Brady is left without his favorite weapon on offense. That and their cornerback situation still remains bloody desperate now that Carlton Davis will likely be out for the next couple weeks.

A few of Miami's weapons on offense are banged up, the most notable being DaVante Parker.

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
their defensive front blows through Miami's laughable line and harangues Jacoby Brissett all day long.

**Miami covers if**  
their defense confuses Brady into playing as ugly as he did last week against the Patriots. It should be easier to pull that off if Gronkowski is still not ready to play.  
\- AND -  
Jacoby Brissett and the offense score at least 14 points.
