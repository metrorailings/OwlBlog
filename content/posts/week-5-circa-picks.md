How did I deny my hunches from last week? As well as that little point about quarterbacks I mentioned in my opening words last week.

If I went with my hunches, I'd likely be 5-0. Washington, Green Bay, and Cleveland covered. Why? Likely because all three of those teams had better (or equal) quarterbacks compared to the teams they were fighting. Yet, I took a risk on Atlanta and backed out of the Packers and Browns games entirely. Instead, I went with the disgustingly hopeless Miami Dolphins. Jacoby Brissett was a goddamn mess in this game. It's bad enough his offensive line does nothing but flap around aimlessly the wind, but his tendency to hold the ball in the pocket only exacerbates the team's woes on offense. A cardboard offensive line combined with a slow-acting quarterback leads to nothing but futility for any offense - and for the first three quarters, the Dolphins were the poster child for this type of futility. Any production that came in the fourth quarter came as a result of the Colts defense playing soft once victory was all but certain.

The Falcons nearly covered. But ultimately, the Washingtonians (under the leadership of one Taylor Heinecke) fought just hard enough to steal the win. Still, Atlanta performed well and from a statistical standpoint, Matt Ryan played decent. It was a game that could have gone either way. With a bit more luck, I would have won this game and ended the week on a 4-1 high.

This week, things are a bit more interesting. History won't play as big a role this week given none of the non-divisional games involve teams that have faced each other recently. Instead, quarterbacks and coaching will be emphasized here.

### Dolphins @ Buccaneers (-10)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Colts** @ Dolphins  
**Buccaneers** @ Patriots

#### _Key Injuries_

Tampa Bay may still be without Rob Gronkowski. Without Gronk, Brady is left without his favorite weapon on offense. That and their cornerback situation still remains bloody desperate now that Carlton Davis will likely be out for the next couple weeks.

A few of Miami's weapons on offense are banged up, the most notable being DaVante Parker.

#### _History_

These two teams haven't faced each other in a good minute. I'll tell you this though - Miami's offensive line has been playing like shit this whole season. It's unlikely that unit will limber up against a Tampa Bay defense known for its vicious pass rushing.

#### _Weather_

Hot and clear

***

Buccaneers -10

***

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
their defensive front blows through Miami's laughable line and harangues Jacoby Brissett all day long.

**Miami covers if**  
their defense confuses Brady into playing as ugly as he did last week against the Patriots. It should be easier to pull that off if Gronkowski is still not ready to play.  
\- AND -  
Jacoby Brissett and the offense score at least 14 points.

### Packers @ Bengals (+3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Steelers @ **Packers**  
Jaguars @ **Bengals**

#### _Key Injuries_

Cincinnati's star rusher hasn't been practicing lately. Keep an eye on him.

Green Bay is mostly healthy, though losing Jaire Alexander hurts a bit.

#### _History_

These two teams have no recent history.

#### _Weather_

Warm breezy weather

***

Uncertain

***

**Cincinnati wins if**  
their defensive front can prevent Green Bay from running the ball effectively.  
\- AND -  
Joe Mixon pops off against a Green Bay defense known for lightly stacking the box.

**Green Bay wins if**  
Aaron Rodgers and Matt LaFleur show their counterparts in Cincinnati that they're much better at executing the Shanahan style of offense.

### Patriots @ Texans (+9)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Buccaneers** @ Patriots  
Texans @ **Bills**

#### _Key Injuries_

The Patriots entire offensive line has been hurting. Expect a few linemen to be sidelined come game day.

Houston is mostly fine.

#### _History_

History is meaningless here given the Texans franchise has been completely reshuffled this season.

#### _Weather_

Hot and humid

***

Patriots -9

***

**New England covers if**  
Belichick demonstrates once more why he's the best at abusing rookie quarterbacks.

**Houston covers if**  
New England losing so many starters along their offensive line renders the Patriot offense impotent. Compounded with the humidity, the Patriot offense may have to suffer through a very slow day down in Texas.

***

### Browns @ Chargers (-2)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Browns** @ Vikings  
Raiders @ **Chargers**

#### _Key Injuries_

Both teams are fairly healthy.

#### _History_

No recent history between these two here. Neither of these two head coaches seem to have faced each other in recent memory.

#### _Weather_

Dome game

***

Chargers -2

***

**Los Angeles covers if**  
their defense keeps Cleveland to less than 4.6 yards rushing. If they're able to keep Josh Jacobs from running buck wild last week, they can potentially lid the Browns with their ground game. Game script matters here for sure.

**Cleveland covers if**  
Kareem Hunt and Nick Chubb both run at more than 4.6 yards a clip.

***

### 49ers @ Cardinals (-5.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Seahawks** @ 49ers  
**Cardinals** @ Rams

#### _Key Injuries_

49ers could still be without George Kittle, but the more important news here is that Trey Lance is expected to start as Jimmy Garoppalo will likely be sidelined yet again. On top of that, elements of their defensive line are a bit beat-up.

Cardinals are mostly healthy.

#### _History_

Both these teams traded wins last year in their two divisional contests against one another. Oddly enough, Arizona managed to pull off the win against a fully healthy 49er team.

Regardless, it's unlikely those matches have any sort of predictive power over this game. San Francisco will be starting an untested rookie at quarterback. Furthermore, the Cardinals of this year have a dramatically different vibe to them compared to last year. Kyler Murray has been playing at a maniacally high level. Their defense has been brutalizing opponents as of late, largely through flashy plays resulting in turnovers. Don't get me wrong, the Cards have still shown themselves very capable of erroneous plays and bad judgment...but it's very clear in their win last week against their big brother Rams that these Arizona boys tapped into something special this season, something that was never there the year before. 

#### _Weather_

Dome game

***

Cardinals -5.5

***

**Arizona covers if**  
they can just compel the 49ers into abandoning the ground game. It's not that San Francisco's rushing attack has been mowing down opposing defense, but Arizona is probably the absolute worst in defending against opposing runners. Arizona can't afford to let San Francisco draw first blood here.

**San Francisco covers if**  
Kyle Shanahan, through wizardry, wills his team to an early lead through scripted plays.  
\- AND -  
After seizing the lead early, San Francisco then commands time of possession by running the ball obsessively.
