How did I deny my hunches from last week? As well as that little point about quarterbacks I mentioned in my opening words last week.

If I went with my hunches, I'd likely be 5-0. Washington, Green Bay, and Cleveland covered. Why? Likely because all three of those teams had better (or equal) quarterbacks compared to the teams they were fighting. Yet, I took a risk on Atlanta and backed out of the Packers and Browns games entirely. Instead, I went with the disgustingly hopeless Miami Dolphins. Jacoby Brissett was a goddamn mess in this game. It's bad enough his offensive line does nothing but flap around aimlessly the wind, but his tendency to hold the ball in the pocket only exacerbates the team's woes on offense. A cardboard offensive line combined with a slow-acting quarterback leads to nothing but futility for any offense - and for the first three quarters, the Dolphins were the poster child for this type of futility. Any production that came in the fourth quarter came as a result of the Colts defense playing soft once victory was all but certain.

The Falcons nearly covered. But ultimately, the Washingtonians (under the leadership of one Taylor Heinecke) fought just hard enough to steal the win. Still, Atlanta performed well and from a statistical standpoint, Matt Ryan played decent. It was a game that could have gone either way. With a bit more luck, I would have won this game and ended the week on a 4-1 high.

This week, things are a bit more interesting. History won't play as big a role this week given none of the non-divisional games involve teams that have faced each other recently. Instead, quarterbacks and coaching will be emphasized here.
