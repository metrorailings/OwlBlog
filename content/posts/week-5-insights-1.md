## Rams @ Seahawks

Neither quarterback is playing all too well.

Seahawks defense presenting quite a few 5-man lines against the Rams in order to stem their zone running attack. Results have been mixed.

Terrell Lewis (with an assist from Aaron Donald) forcing a huge holding call that resulted in a Seattle touchdown being taken off the board. Later, the man has a big sack to effectively kill a Seahawks drive.

Matthew Stafford throwing an interception that he never expected to throw.

Stafford underthrew DeSean Jackson, but he was bailed out by Jackson's vision.

The Seahawks are just awful in their pass coverage. These receivers have so much space around them. Any good quarterback should be able to smoke their secondary for big yards.

Cooper Kupp is the best receiver for the Rams, no question. Just stunting all over the Seahawks. Woods is having a damn good night too, but Kupp is just special.

## Dolphins @ Buccaneers

Seeing much less man coverage from the Buccaneers. More zone looks.
