## Rams @ Seahawks

Neither quarterback is playing all too well.

Seahawks defense presenting quite a few 5-man lines against the Rams in order to stem their zone running attack. Results have been mixed.

Terrell Lewis (with an assist from Aaron Donald) forcing a huge holding call that resulted in a Seattle touchdown being taken off the board. Later, the man has a big sack to effectively kill a Seahawks drive.

Matthew Stafford throwing an interception that he never expected to throw.

Stafford underthrew DeSean Jackson, but he was bailed out by Jackson's vision.

The Seahawks are just awful in their pass coverage. These receivers have so much space around them. Any good quarterback should be able to smoke their secondary for big yards.

Cooper Kupp is the best receiver for the Rams, no question. Just stunting all over the Seahawks. Woods is having a damn good night too, but Kupp is just special.

## Dolphins @ Buccaneers

Seeing much less man coverage from the Buccaneers. More zone looks.

Brady really trying hard to make deep sideline throws against these Dolphin corners. These Miami cornerbacks are too good though.

Jacoby playing very well despite a bad hamstring. Where the hell was this last week? I also see Davis Mills playing well against New England. Seems to me that quarterbacks that have a really bad day the week before regress hard to the median the week after, so long as they're committed to their craft.

## Saints @ Washington

Jameis not playing well at all. In fact, an errant pass from him led to Taysom Hill being murdered on live television.

It'd be worth looking into whether New Orleans and Alvin Kamara can actually run the ball.

Deonte Harris and Taysom Hill are out of this game early. Not good for a New Orleans team already short on playmakers.

Taylor Heinecke throwing an interception against a three-man pass rush. Insert laughing emoji here. The kid is truly the son Ryan Fitzpatrick always wanted.

## Packers @ Bengals

Aaron Rodgers with a masterful 3rd down completion.

Rodgers is so dependent on Davante Adams that it's scary to imagine what would happen to this passing offense if Davante is sidelined. MVS, Randall Cobb, and Robert Tonyan would need to pick up the slack somehow.

## Giants @ Cowboys

As expected, the Cowboys are leaving track marks all over the Giants defensive front. Dallas nearly piled up a hundred rush yards in the _1st quarter alone_. Kudos to Kellen Moore for opting to run the ball way more than pass it.

Dak seems a little shook to me. I question his mental toughness. It's clear he's not too comfortable opening this game.

Daniel Jones missing some long-distance throws. His inaccuracy can be excused a little bit given that Dallas is getting some steady pressure on him.

Trevon Diggs may be something special. His pass coverage and nose for the ball is simply sensational. In a little over one quarter, he's nearly picked off Jones three times.

Dallas loves its press coverage. It feels weird to say this, but it's nice to see Dan Quinn evolve his style of defense to something that seems to really fit his defensive personnel.

Seems like the Giants need to blitz to get any sort of pressure.

Telling that the Giants offense was unable to produce any real yardage on their scripted plays. Even more damning to see Jason Garrett risk the health of his promising quarterback on a risky goal-line stand where the Dallas defense was playing considerably more aggressively.

Oddly enough, the Giants defense seems to have clamped down on Dallas ground game after the first quarter. 

But just like that, the Cowboys pick up their ground game once they start running outside the box with pulled guards and tackles leading the way. The Giants need to fix their C gap issues before they're finally competent against the run.

## 49ers @ Cardinals

The Cardinals have a magic about them. Kyler Murray throwing deep against the grain to DeAndre Hopkins with two defenders bracketing Hopkins. Then Kyler Murray throwing a bullet to Hopkins despite Josh Norman having some ridiculous inside leverage....only for Hopkins to catch the ball!

As expected, Trey Lance sucks.

***

## Bills @ Chiefs

Chiefs not blitzing as much, despite flashing some looks here and there. Might be worried about that pass coverage. 

Dawson Knox a significant contributor on offense.

Orlando Brown a point of weakness for the Chiefs.

Josh Allen has been fantastic. His improvisational plays and his ability to make quick reads has really been the difference in this affair.

The Chiefs seem to genuinely hate playing at a scheduled pace. Big plays to Tyreek Hill are necessary for this Kansas offense to go past second gear.

## Browns @ Chargers

This Browns defensive backfield isn't good. It's just not good. It's worth nothing whether Denzel Ward and the other starting cornerback were sidelined early in the game. I'm not sure...

It's remarkable how similar these two teams are. Defensively, both teams prioritize pass coverage over run defense. It's obvious if you look at their base defense. Offensively, both have similar play-action concepts. Whereas the Chargers are more playful with route trees, Cleveland builds its passing game mostly through play-action. 

It took until halfway through the second quarter before Cleveland was able to force the Los Angeles offense to punt, thanks finally to their pass rushers forcing their will on the drive. 

Chargers are actively chipping defenders on the right side of their offensive line in order to help out Storm Norton. Good for them. Also, their drives seem to be more predicated on quick passes and fast decision-making, which helps to minimize any impact Cleveland's pass rush could have.

Doesn't mean Cleveland hasn't been able to apply pressure. The few times their offense stalled was largely due to Cleveland's defensive front harassing Herbert.

Keenan Allen and Mike Williams are too damn tall for for most cornerbacks in the league. It's an advantage the Chargers are not shy to exploit.
