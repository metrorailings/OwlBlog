## Rams @ Seahawks

Neither quarterback is playing all too well.

Seahawks defense presenting quite a few 5-man lines against the Rams in order to stem their zone running attack. Results have been mixed.

Terrell Lewis (with an assist from Aaron Donald) forcing a huge holding call that resulted in a Seattle touchdown being taken off the board. Later, the man has a big sack to effectively kill a Seahawks drive.

Matthew Stafford throwing an interception that he never expected to throw.

Stafford underthrew DeSean Jackson, but he was bailed out by Jackson's vision.
