## Buccaneers @ Bears

Excellent use of crossing routes from these Buccaneers.

Chicago's failure to pass the ball is almost entirely on Nick Foles here, not because of Tampa Bay's pass coverage. Tampa Bay's coverage unit seems like a liability that can be readily exploited against an able quarterback.

Roquan Smith failing to make tackles in the run game.

Sloppy penalties from Chicago's secondary gifting ridiculous yardage to Tampa Bay.

Brady doing well building rapport with his weapons.

Allen Robinson is Nick Foles' best friend.
