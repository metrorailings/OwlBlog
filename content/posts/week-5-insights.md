## Buccaneers @ Bears

Excellent use of crossing routes from these Buccaneers.

Chicago's failure to pass the ball is almost entirely on Nick Foles here, not because of Tampa Bay's pass coverage. Tampa Bay's coverage unit seems like a liability that can be readily exploited against an able quarterback.

Roquan Smith failing to make tackles in the run game.

Sloppy penalties from Chicago's secondary gifting ridiculous yardage to Tampa Bay.

Brady doing well building rapport with his weapons.

Allen Robinson is Nick Foles' best friend.

Bruce Arians did not go for the riskier play on 4th and 1, instead settling for a chip shot field goal, despite the fact that the quarterback on the other side is Nick Foles.

Tom Brady telling his offensive line to "wake the fuck up" is something special.

## Raiders @ Chiefs

Ruggs is the real deal, catching an underthrown David Carr pass against heavily contested coverage.

David Carr sucks. Two poorly thrown passes.

Once again, David Carr sucks.

This Raiders defense is too funny at falling for the Chiefs' misdirection plays.

Raiders defensive line simply not getting it done. Their defensive ends in particular playing a special brand of pathetic football.

It took a quarter, but Carr has finally settled into a groove and connected on some nice throws.

Once again, Ruggs speed makes him a veritable threat.

Mahomes cannot be given too much time to make throws. Otherwise, a successful completion is all but inevitable.

Carr loves to make audibles at the line of scrimmage. The problem for him becomes what happens when the play doesn't pan out as expected. Thought then again, Carr was able to convert on a critical third-down even when the the Chiefs snuffed out the tight-end screen.

And then...Carr fails to connect to a wide open Jalen Richard on a 3rd down as the Chiefs were able to rattle him with a blitz.

The Raiders are concentrating more resources in the defensive backfield, forcing Mahomes into throwing inadvisable passes. It's weird, but Mahomes preference for throwing passes deep is biting him in the ass hard here. He and the offense aren't adjusting accordingly.

Las Vegas has done well studying last week's Patriots tape and assessing all the ways Kansas City is vulnerable on both sides of the ball. Well done.

Part of Las Vegas' success here is dependent on Josh Jacobs and Derek Carr controlling time of possession with a combination of the power ground attack and the short passing game. Las Vegas was able to do just that in the second half, in pretty sharp contrast to their first half when Carr was airing the ball out like a gunslinger.

## Giants @ Cowboys

This Cowboys defense is hilarious. Their inability to stop the run is something truly remarkable. The fact that the Giants are getting some serious push should be worrying

Daniel Jones is still staring down his receivers. The only good thing is that the Cowboys aren't really reacting to Daniel Jones' eyes, unlike the Rams of last week.

Dallas' defenders are not buying into this system at all. Their lack of effort is screaming apathy. Perhaps this is what happens when you impose a system that sharply contradicts the simple and aggressive form of defense that Dallas ran last year. It's clear this defense is certainly more cerebral compared to the style of defense Marinelli and Kris Richard pushed over the past few years.

Cowboys offense finally makes money through a combination of Zeke (inside zone?) runs and short bootlegs.

Jaylon Smith is finally showing up here on key plays.

Jaylon Smith blowing up a home-run screen.

Craig Wrolstad's referee crew may be the biggest homers in the league.

## Dolphins @ 49ers

Miami certainly loves their five-receiver sets. I wonder if it's playing a significant role here in their thrashing of this San Francisco team.

Garoppalo is truly awful when playing from behind.

The 49ers secondary is a huge liability against these teams with pass-heavy sets. What the hell made me want to pick this team again?

Even great coaches like Kyle Shanahan can't work around shitty performances from their quarterbacks.

Then again, Garoppalo might still be suffering hard from a high-ankle sprain he suffered just two weeks ago. Which is a reminder that when key players come back from injury, I need to assess whether they're truly healthy. People weren't actually expecting Garoppalo to come back earlier in the week, which should have been a red flag here. Could Shanahan have tried to rush Garoppalo back into action given the way the 49ers schedule dramatically ramps up over the next several weeks?

## Vikings @ Seahawks

Solid use of misdirection by Minnesota to prevent the Seahawks from keying in on Dalvin Cook runs.

The Vikings are very content playing cover-two defense against the Russell Wilson offense. And so far, it's working spectacularly.

Minnesota playing with some passion.

Now Seattle is playing with some heated passion in this second half, especially with how quickly they retook the lead.

Seattle has made a few adjustments in the second half, namely on defense. The Seahawks are stacking the line of scrimmage and forcing the Vikings into playing a much more conventional brand of football. It's a bit of a gamble, but Seattle is essentially saying that Minnesota's offensive line won't be able to hold the damn against Seattle's defensive front consistently enough.

On offense, Russell Wilson has been able to nail some big passes in the second half, though the exact reason why remains to be seen. I do notice that the Seahawks are slightly more willing to throw short, those these short passes haven't really yielded much outside of a tricky bootleg screen. Still, it feels like Seattle is more intent on staying faithful to its deep passing attack.

Notice Minnesota is still running the ball successfully against this Seattle defense, despite not having Dalvin Cook for an entire half.

It seems Kirk Cousins' first read is almost always Adam Thielan, who's open much more often than not against this Seattle defense.

KJ Wright is a special linebacker. Seattle may have the best set of linebackers in the league.

## Eagles @ Steelers

Steelers interestingly using jet sweeps and end-around to create some misdirection on running plays.It hasn't worked, as the Eagles have been more keen on stopping the ground game. Perhaps explains why a jet sweep on a few plays produced some decent yardage.

Two big penalties sustained a Steelers drive that ended in a touchdown. One a defensive pass interference and the other a personal foul. A damn shame too.

The Eagles cornerbacks are serious liabilities.

Travis Fulgham is the real thing, I dare say.

The Steelers signature running play is when they pull a guard and either a tackle or a tight end around on a lead run play.

Sheer mismanagement by Philly to close out the first half.

Excellent series of play calls from Pittsburgh. The Steelers used a play-action with lead blockers to fool Philly's defense to shift one way so as to open up a wide lane for an end-around going the other way. Then the Steelers stacked four receivers to one side for a screen ending in a touchdown.

Wentz's footwork is really questionable.

Misdirection is once again working well in the Steelers' favor here. A big play-action misdirection led to a big penalty against Philadelphia that set up the Steelers for a goal-to-go situation.

Chase Claypool is the real deal for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Roethlisberger and the coaches seem to think Darius Slay is a real liability for the Philadelphia Eagles.

***

## Chargers @ Saints

Finally, Brees is building some steady rapport with Emmanuel Sanders. Easily the best game Sanders has had as a New Orleans Saint.

Justin Herbert's vision is extraordinary.

The Chargers offense with their conservative play-calling towards the end of the game is a little aggravating. Seems like Lynn would love nothing more than to run the ball the entire fourth quarter. Lynn is not built to run up leads, let alone close out games against tough teams.

So many goddamn draw runs.

Brees with some nice touch on a deep ball to Jared Cook for a touchdown.

Still, the eye test doesn't lie. Brees has been mostly throwing short for the entire duration of the game.

***

## Colts @ Browns

Solid use of the bootleg early from the Browns.

Mayfield in shotgun is not ideal. Two shotgun plays killed a promising drive.

Bad foot mechanics from Mayfield. Just put him under center and give up on him as a shotgun quarterback.

Cleveland pass protection has been holding up well though.

Their ground game, on the other hand, hasn't really taken off against this Colts front. Indianapolis is consistently winning at the point of attack.

Read-option is a part of this Cleveland offense, apparently.

So far, the Colts are continuing to win at the point of attack against this zone-running scheme Cleveland is trying to run.

Baker seems to favor throws over the middle, particularly towards his tight ends.

Odell seems to have bought in to this offense.

Baker's composure under pressure needs to be questioned, as does his decision making from negative game script.

Philip Rivers is soooo bad.

***

## Bills @ Titans

Nothing but short underneath passes from Josh Allen on the Bills' first drive in the second half.

Allen tried to force an intermediate pass on an ill-timed throw leading to an interception.

Just sloppy football by Buffalo. Drops, penalties, errors in judgement....it seems like Buffalo was the team that hasn't practiced in two weeks.

Well done by Tennessee, orchestrating a win here despite not having practiced. Not the first time adversity has united a team away from the practice field.
