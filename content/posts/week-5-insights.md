## Buccaneers @ Bears

Excellent use of crossing routes from these Buccaneers.

Chicago's failure to pass the ball is almost entirely on Nick Foles here, not because of Tampa Bay's pass coverage. Tampa Bay's coverage unit seems like a liability that can be readily exploited against an able quarterback.

Roquan Smith failing to make tackles in the run game.

Sloppy penalties from Chicago's secondary gifting ridiculous yardage to Tampa Bay.

Brady doing well building rapport with his weapons.

Allen Robinson is Nick Foles' best friend.

Bruce Arians did not go for the riskier play on 4th and 1, instead settling for a chip shot field goal, despite the fact that the quarterback on the other side is Nick Foles.

Tom Brady telling his offensive line to "wake the fuck up" is something special.

## Raiders @ Chiefs

Ruggs is the real deal, catching an underthrown David Carr pass against heavily contested coverage.

David Carr sucks. Two poorly thrown passes.

Once again, David Carr sucks.

This Raiders defense is too funny at falling for the Chiefs' misdirection plays.

Raiders defensive line simply not getting it done. Their defensive ends in particular playing a special brand of pathetic football.

It took a quarter, but Carr has finally settled into a groove and connected on some nice throws.

Once again, Ruggs speed makes him a veritable threat.

Mahomes cannot be given too much time to make throws. Otherwise, a successful completion is all but inevitable.

Carr loves to make audibles at the line of scrimmage. The problem for him becomes what happens when the play doesn't pan out as expected. Thought then again, Carr was able to convert on a critical third-down even when the the Chiefs snuffed out the tight-end screen. 

And then...Carr fails to connect to a wide open Jalen Richard on a 3rd down as the Chiefs were able to rattle him with a blitz.

The Raiders are concentrating more resources in the defensive backfield, forcing Mahomes into throwing inadvisable passes. It's weird, but Mahomes preference for throwing passes deep is biting him in the ass hard here. He and the offense aren't adjusting accordingly.

Las Vegas has done well studying last week's Patriots tape and assessing all the ways Kansas City is vulnerable on both sides of the ball. Well done.

Part of Las Vegas' success here is dependent on Josh Jacobs and Derek Carr controlling time of possession with a combination of the power ground attack and the short passing game. Las Vegas was able to do just that in the second half, in pretty sharp contrast to their first half when Carr was airing the ball out like a gunslinger.
