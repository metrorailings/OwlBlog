## Vikings @ Giants

Zimmer cannot still shake off his pathological conservative nature on offense. On a 3rd & 20 play in the red zone, Zimmer opted for the shotgun draw.

Jabrill Peppers has been beastly against the run today.

Giants zone defense is simply lousy, as expected.

Dalvin Cook is something special.

Daniel Jones seems to genuinely enjoy throwing outside the numbers, even against tight coverage. The Giants need more X-style receivers that could catch those contested balls.

## Packers @ Cowboys

Read-option slants aren't the best option against man coverage, Cowboys.

The Packers two starting cornerbacks (Jaire Alexander and Kevin King) along with the team's two starting edge rushers (Preston Smith and Za'Darius Smith) are truly something. Those four players form the foundation for one of the NFL's better defenses.

The Packers defense has an affinity for dime coverages on passing downs, leaving them a little vulnerable against opposing rushers. If only the Cowboys recognized this...

Garrett has little juice.

## Colts @ Chiefs

Colts have a hard time working out of negative game script.

Colts are shameless in their commitment to the run, but it's working. The Chiefs and their scrub defense are no match for a cohesive Indianapolis front - the Colts offensive line are winning the battle in the trenches.

Mahomes is stripped of his magic due to a limp. He's still making some pretty passes though.

Frank Reich is one of the best coaches in the league. To take a team decimated by injuries into incredibly hostile territory and to win outright as double-digit underdogs is impressive.

## Buccaneers @ Saints

Jameis Winston is an amalgamation of good and bad quarterbacking. As simple as that.

Saints maintaining balance between the run and the pass, despite Tampa Bay supposedly being much better at defending the run compared to the pass.

Ronald Jones is quite the speedster halfback for Tampa Bay.

Bucs seem content prioritizing the run over the passing game, at least for a few first-half drives.

Tampa Bay seems almost powerless against Michael Thomas.

Teddy Bridgewater showing development, throwing deep on several occasions against a rather weak Tampa Bay secondary.

Winston making bad decisions and erratic throws against this Saints. It's almost as if this team has him shook. Either that or playing his second straight road game has taken the edge off his quarterbacking.

This referee crew seems far more lenient when it comes to pass interference.

Once again, Tampa Bay has sold itself on the run being more important than the pass in this game. Quite interesting considering the number of receiving weapons the team boasts on offense.

## Bears vs Raiders (London)

It's clear the Bears didn't really give much of a shit to prepare for this game. Sloppy play on both sides of the ball, the Raiders making hay mostly by rushing Josh Jacobs and throwing short passes, flying into London late into the week...all these things indicate that Chicago was content trying to wing this game. I feel like a damn fool picking the Bears here. Let it be known that an underprepared team is a likely loser.

## Browns @ 49ers

Cleveland making some serious hay with some brilliantly-executed misdirection plays.

But once a funk sets in, this Browns team deflates quickly.

The 49ers chewing up a lot of yardage with that outside zone rushing attack. I wonder if the same game plan that teams use to attack the Rams will apply here with the 49ers.

Garoppolo has been frankly disappointing. Need to see him carry a game for once against a respectable team.

Baker honestly has issues seeing open receivers. I wonder if throws up the middle are all the more difficult now that it's been confirmed that Baker cannot see past the line of scrimmage at times.
