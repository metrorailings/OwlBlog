## Vikings @ Giants

Zimmer cannot still shake off his pathological conservative nature on offense. On a 3rd & 20 play in the red zone, Zimmer opted for the shotgun draw.

Jabrill Peppers has been beastly against the run today.

Giants zone defense is simply lousy, as expected.

Dalvin Cook is something special.

Daniel Jones seems to genuinely enjoy throwing outside the numbers, even against tight coverage. The Giants need more X-style receivers that could catch those contested balls.

## Packers @ Cowboys

Read-option slants aren't the best option against man coverage, Cowboys.

The Packers two starting cornerbacks (Jaire Alexander and Kevin King) along with the team's two starting edge rushers (Preston Smith and Za'Darius Smith) are truly something. Those four players form the foundation for one of the NFL's better defenses.

The Packers defense has an affinity for dime coverages on passing downs, leaving them a little vulnerable against opposing rushers. If only the Cowboys recognized this...

Garrett has little juice.

## Colts @ Chiefs

Colts have a hard time working out of negative game script.

Colts are shameless in their commitment to the run, but it's working. The Chiefs and their scrub defense are no match for a cohesive Indianapolis front - the Colts offensive line are winning the battle in the trenches.

Mahomes is stripped of his magic due to a limp. He's still making some pretty passes though.

Frank Reich is one of the best coaches in the league. To take a team decimated by injuries into incredibly hostile territory and to win outright as double-digit underdogs is impressive.

## Buccaneers @ Saints

Jameis Winston is an amalgamation of good and bad quarterbacking. As simple as that.

Saints maintaining balance between the run and the pass, despite Tampa Bay supposedly being much better at defending the run compared to the pass.

Ronald Jones is quite the speedster halfback for Tampa Bay.

Bucs seem content prioritizing the run over the passing game, at least for a few first-half drives.

Tampa Bay seems almost powerless against Michael Thomas.

Teddy Bridgewater showing development, throwing deep on several occasions against a rather weak Tampa Bay secondary.
