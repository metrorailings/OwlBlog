## Vikings @ Giants

Zimmer cannot still shake off his pathological conservative nature on offense. On a 3rd & 20 play in the red zone, Zimmer opted for the shotgun draw.

Jabrill Peppers has been beastly against the run today.

Giants zone defense is simply lousy, as expected.

Dalvin Cook is something special.

Daniel Jones seems to genuinely enjoy throwing outside the numbers, even against tight coverage. The Giants need more X-style receivers that could catch those contested balls.
