### Raiders @ Chiefs (-12.5)

> Raiders +12.5

***

Not the biggest fan of this pick. I hate resting my fortunes on Derek Carr, especially when the Chiefs are well aware he can be easily rattled.

But looking at last year's game, I can see the Raiders actually played decently from a statistical perspective. If it weren't for turnovers, it's possible the Raiders could have threatened an upset victory.

But those turnovers came likely because the Chiefs have a beat on this Raiders offense. So that only concerns me more here. I don't think I'll be putting this one on my card.
