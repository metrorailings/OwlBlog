### Raiders @ Chiefs (-12.5)

> Raiders +12.5

***

Not the biggest fan of this pick. I hate resting my fortunes on Derek Carr, especially when the Chiefs are well aware he can be easily rattled.

But looking at last year's game, I can see the Raiders actually played decently from a statistical perspective. If it weren't for turnovers, it's possible the Raiders could have threatened an upset victory.

But those turnovers came likely because the Chiefs have a beat on this Raiders offense. So that's way too concerning, especially considering the Las Vegas offense hasn't really evolved much from last year.  I don't think I'll be putting this one on my card.

### Panthers @ Falcons (-1.5)

> Panthers +1.5

***

Unlike the Falcons, the Panthers have proven themselves winners on multiple occasions this year. I've been impressed with Matt Rhule and Joe Brady and this attitude of cool toughness they've been able to foster down there in Carolina.

Dan Quinn's squad, meanwhile, has done nothing this season to demonstrate competence. Last week's pathetic outing against Green Bay didn't convince me at all that the team has any real will to fight back and regain face. The Falcons were still committing stupid mistakes. Defensive linemen weren't winning any of their battles at the line of scrimmage. And the offense never gained any rhythm.

I'll only believe in the Falcons once I see them turn the corner. Until then, I'm comfortable betting against them, especially when their opponent's led by quality coaches.

### Jaguars @ Texans (-6)

> Texans -6

***

Give me a Texans team looking to make a statement after firing their hated head coach. Deshaun Watson unleashed should be enough to cover this spread against a bottom-feeder like the Jaguars defense. Here's hoping Houston shines immediately after ridding themselves of their biggest albatross.

***

### Bengals @ Ravens (-12.5)

> Bengals +12.5

***

I wish I felt better about this pick. But the reality is that Cincinnati is justifiably a double-digit underdog given the overwhelming talent and coaching deficit between the two teams. Quite simply put, the Ravens are a complete team and the Bengals are a very unfinished product.

Taking the Bengals here would mean relying on Joe Burrow to make just enough plays to slide into a late cover here. The Ravens may help out by opting to replace Lamar Jackson with Robert Griffin III once the fourth quarter starts, but I'd rather not rely on that happening if I'm going to include this in my card.

***

### Dolphins @ 49ers (-8.5)

> 49ers -8.5

***

If the 49ers were a bit healthier on defense, I'd be much more confident in this pick. That said, San Francisco is expected to come into this match with very little depth along their defensive front and their defensive backfield.

The hope here is that the offense returning to full strength this week combined with a humiliating performance against a depressing Eagles team last week gives them the fire needed to play at a frenetic level this week. It also helps that the Dolphins have to trek across 3,000 miles of land to play this game.

***

### Vikings @ Seahawks (-7)

> Seahawks -7

***

Even at this slightly inflated spread, give me a Russell Wilson and a Seahawks offense firing on all cylinders against an immature Vikings defense. 

I know Kirk Cousins and Dalvin Cook will cook in this game but I'm hoping a juiced Seahawks defense will make just enough plays to keep the Vikings offense at bay and help Seattle cover here. The Seahawks success here on defense will depend largely on its hodgepodge defensive front.
