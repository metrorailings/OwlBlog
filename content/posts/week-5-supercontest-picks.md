### Raiders @ Chiefs (-12.5)

> Raiders +12.5

***

Not the biggest fan of this pick. I hate resting my fortunes on Derek Carr, especially when the Chiefs are well aware he can be easily rattled.

But looking at last year's game, I can see the Raiders actually played decently from a statistical perspective. If it weren't for turnovers, it's possible the Raiders could have threatened an upset victory.

But those turnovers came likely because the Chiefs have a beat on this Raiders offense. So that's way too concerning, especially considering the Las Vegas offense hasn't really evolved much from last year.  I don't think I'll be putting this one on my card.

### Panthers @ Falcons (-1.5)

> Panthers +1.5

***

Unlike the Falcons, the Panthers have proven themselves winners on multiple occasions this year. I've been impressed with Matt Rhule and Joe Brady and this attitude of cool toughness they've been able to foster down there in Carolina.

Dan Quinn's squad, meanwhile, has done nothing this season to demonstrate competence. Last week's pathetic outing against Green Bay didn't convince me at all that the team has any real will to fight back and regain face. The Falcons were still committing stupid mistakes. Defensive linemen weren't winning any of their battles at the line of scrimmage. And the offense never gained any rhythm.

I'll only believe in the Falcons once I see them turn the corner. Until then, I'm comfortable betting against them, especially when their opponent's led by quality coaches.

### Jaguars @ Texans (-6)

> Texans -6

***

Give me a Texans team looking to make a statement after firing their hated head coach. Deshaun Watson unleashed should be enough to cover this spread against a bottom-feeder like the Jaguars defense. Here's hoping Houston shines immediately after ridding themselves of their biggest albatross.
