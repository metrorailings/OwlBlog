Finally! We have a good week. My picks were pretty much on point. The Browns barely lost thanks to a foolish decision by Brandon Staley to not take a knee before kicking the field goal for a guaranteed win. Other than that, all my decisions were justified, mostly for reasons I listed in my analysis of each and every one. Beautiful!

Let's keep this up. Last week, I shied away from two matches that were originally appealing to me, thanks mostly to my early analysis of those matches. Let that be evidence that these breakdowns are fruitful in identifying potential games that may be traps.
