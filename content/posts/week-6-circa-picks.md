+++
Finally! We have a good week. My picks were pretty much on point. The Browns barely lost thanks to a foolish decision by Brandon Staley to not take a knee before kicking the field goal for a guaranteed win. Other than that, all my decisions were justified, mostly for reasons I listed in my analysis of each and every one. Beautiful!

Let's keep this up. Last week, I shied away from two matches that were originally appealing to me, thanks mostly to my early analysis of those matches. Let that be evidence that these breakdowns are fruitful in identifying potential games that may be traps.

***

## Chiefs @ Washington (+7)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Bills** @ Chiefs  
**Saints** @ Washington

#### _Key Injuries_

Worth keeping an eye on the Chiefs. Both Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce suffered injuries last week, though none of their injuries are projected to hold them out.

#### _History_

No recent history, as these two teams play in different conferences.

#### _Weather_

Perfect spring scrimmage weather

Chiefs -7

***

**Kansas City covers if**  
Tyreek Hill posts over 120 yards against Washington's inept secondary  
\- AND -  
the defense can force some negative plays from Taylor Heinecke, who's known for playing fast and loose with the football.

**Washington covers if**  
Taylor Heinecke can minimize his recklessness  
\- OR -  
their defensive backs can keep Tyreek Hill bracketed for much of the game. A pretty tall ask considering the Washington secondary has discovered new ways to shit the bed every week this season.

## Chargers @ Ravens (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Browns @ **Chargers**  
Colts @ **Ravens**

#### _Key Injuries_

Both the Chargers and the Ravens lost a starting-caliber guard along their offensive line.

#### _History_

No recent history between these two teams. Not that history should mean much given the new regime in effect in Los Angeles.

If there's one thing that can be said about this year's Chargers, it's that the defense doesn't hold up well against opposing rushers. The Cowboys dealt the franchise its only loss in part by sustaining drives through the ground game. Likewise, the Browns nearly pulled off the win last week after their halfbacks gashed through the defense at 6.7 yards a clip.

It doesn't mean the Chargers are guaranteed to lose against any team boasting a solid rushing attack. But they do struggle.

Interestingly enough, both of these teams are coming off winning streaks. It's hard to say whether either of these two teams are overvalued against one another. 

#### _Weather_

Somewhat cool, with winds expected to reach up to 15 miles per hour

Undecided

***

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Justin Herbert and his top receivers can constantly strike gold with the passing game. Herbert will need to be able to negotiate through all the blitzes Wink Martindale will likely throw at him.

**Baltimore covers if**  
Lamar Jackson and the offense can dominate time of possession  
\- AND -  
the Ravens make just enough dynamite plays on defense to keep the Chargers from running up the score.
