headline = "Week 6 Circa Picks"

+++
Finally! We have a good week. My picks were pretty much on point. The Browns barely lost thanks to a foolish decision by Brandon Staley to not take a knee before kicking the field goal for a guaranteed win. Other than that, all my decisions were justified, mostly for reasons I listed in my analysis of each and every one. Beautiful!

Let's keep this up. Last week, I shied away from two matches that were originally appealing to me, thanks mostly to my early analysis of those matches. Let that be evidence that these breakdowns are fruitful in identifying potential games that may be traps.

***

### Chiefs @ Washington (+7)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Bills** @ Chiefs (SNF)  
**Saints** @ Washington

#### _Key Injuries_

Worth keeping an eye on the Chiefs. Both Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce suffered injuries last week, though none of their injuries are projected to hold them out.

#### _History_

No recent history, as these two teams play in different conferences.

#### _Weather_

Perfect spring scrimmage weather

***

Chiefs -7

***

**Kansas City covers if**  
Tyreek Hill posts over 120 yards against Washington's inept secondary  
\- AND -  
the defense can force some negative plays from Taylor Heinecke, who's known for playing fast and loose with the football.

**Washington covers if**  
Taylor Heinecke can minimize his recklessness  
\- OR -  
their defensive backs can keep Tyreek Hill bracketed for much of the game. A pretty tall ask considering the Washington secondary has discovered new ways to shit the bed every week this season.

***

### Chargers @ Ravens (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Browns @ **Chargers**  
Colts @ **Ravens** (MNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

Both the Chargers and the Ravens lost a starting-caliber guard along their offensive line.

#### _History_

No recent history between these two teams. Not that history should mean much given the new regime in effect in Los Angeles.

If there's one thing that can be said about this year's Chargers, it's that the defense doesn't hold up well against opposing rushers. The Cowboys dealt the franchise its only loss in part by sustaining drives through the ground game. Likewise, the Browns nearly pulled off the win last week after their halfbacks gashed through the defense at 6.7 yards a clip.

It doesn't mean the Chargers are guaranteed to lose against any team boasting a solid rushing attack. But they do struggle.

Interestingly enough, both of these teams are coming off winning streaks. It's hard to say whether either of these two teams are overvalued against one another.

#### _Weather_

Somewhat cool, with winds expected to reach up to 15 miles per hour

***

Undecided

***

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Justin Herbert and his top receivers can constantly strike gold with the passing game. Herbert will need to be able to negotiate through all the blitzes Wink Martindale will be throwing at him.

**Baltimore covers if**  
Lamar Jackson and the offense can dominate time of possession  
\- AND -  
the Ravens make just enough noise on defense to keep the Chargers from running up the score.

***

### Rams @ Giants (+10.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Rams** @ Seahawks (TNF)  
Colts @ **Ravens**

#### _Key Injuries_

The Giants are a wounded bunch right now, especially on offense. Daniel Jones, Saquon Barkley, and Kenny Golladay are all but confirmed to be out for this game. Sterling Shepard and Darius Slayton's statuses are uncertain. We might potentially have a scenario where Mike Glennon is starting with Devontae Booker at his side and Kadarius Toney, CJ Board, and Evan Engram as his starting receivers. Not a great hand for New York to play against the visiting Rams...

#### _History_

Both of these teams faced one another last year, though the quarterback situation was very different - Daniel Jones and Jared Goff were the signal callers in charge then. Now we have Mike Glennon and Matthew Stafford instead. One wonders if there's really much of a downgrade from the Daniel Jones of last year to the Mike Glennon of recent memory. One thing for sure though...Matthew Stafford is a refreshing upgrade over Jared Bruhff.

Regardless though, New York kept the game competitive, although I'm pretty certain Los Angeles always maintained wrist control throughout the entire affair. I need to review the game to fully understand what happened.

One thing worth noting is - the Giants defense of last year actually cared to stop the run. The unit this year? Not so much. These group of guys now turn to mush against opposing running backs.

#### _Weather_

A bit cool with some 10 mile-per-hour winds swirling around

***

Undecided

***

\**Los Angeles covers if  
\**they dice up the Giants with their outside zone runs. Dallas ruined New York's defense last week with outside runs. If the Giants continue having no answer to this mode of attack, the Rams will secure a ridiculously easy win.

**New York covers if**  
they keep the Rams from running roughshod over them with their ground game  
\- AND -  
Mike Glennon doesn't make an ass out of himself out there. Expect a good number of gadget plays here incorporating Toney and his versatility.

***

### Packers @ Bears (+4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Packers** @ Bengals  
**Bears** @ Raiders

#### _Key Injuries_

Whereas the Packers a bit thin at cornerback, the Bears seem a bit strained along their defensive front. It's worth keeping an eye on these two position groups as the week goes on.

#### _History_

Being divisional rivals, both of these teams face each regularly. Last year, Green Bay pulled off a clean sweep of these Bears, dominating them handily in both match-ups. The only real difference this year is that Mitch Trubisky has been swapped out with a younger version of himself in Justin Fields.

#### _Weather_

Cool with some moderate winds jetting around

***

Packers -4.5

***

**Green Bay covers if**  
their offense runs up a double-digit lead by the fourth quarter. Certainly possible if the Packers can dominate time of possession by stifling the Bear offense.

**Chicago covers if**  
the team draws first blood and maintains a lead through the whole game. If Chicago starts falling behind by multiple scores, Nagy and the coaches would then need to cut the marionette strings off Justin Fields and let him attempt a comeback. That's incredibly unlikely, given Nagy and his staff are calling plays deliberately drawn up to minimize the rookie quarterback's impact on the offense.

***

### Vikings @ Panthers (+1)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Lions @ **Vikings**  
**Eagles** @ Panthers

#### _Key Injuries_

Christian McCaffrey's status is the most important here. So far, he's been practicing, which is a great sign.

The Vikings have a number of skill players on offense not playing, but it's knot known yet whether any of their injuries are serious enough to keep them sidelined.

#### _History_

Both these teams met last year in Minnesota. The Vikings edged out the Panthers by a point (which ironically matches the spread here). It's worth keeping in mind Carolina was in a position to win the game with a last-second field goal.

#### _Weather_

Lovely spring weather

***

Panthers +1

***

**Carolina covers if**  
Christian McCaffrey's return sparks a resurgence in their offense  
\- AND -  
their vaunted defensive front uses its newfound love of the blitz to prevent Kirk Cousins from ever settling into a rhythm.

**Minnesota covers if**  
Kirk Cousins is as proficient as he was last year against this Panther defense, completing over 70% of his passes.

***

### Cardinals @ Browns (-2.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

49ers @ **Cardinals**  
Browns @ **Chargers**

#### _Key Injuries_

Arizona is dealing with a nagging injury to Kyler Murray's throwing shoulder. Although Murray is expected to play, expect the Cardinals air game to suffer if Murray isn't able to throw cleanly.

Cleveland's dealing with its own share of injuries, though all key players are expected to play. It's advisable to keep tabs on Cleveland's defensive backfield, though it might not matter much if Kyler's out there throwing balls  with a stupid shoulder.

#### _History_

No history at all between these two teams, as both teams belong to different conferences. That being said, Arizona has been absolutely pathetic in its attempt to stonewall opposing rushers. Besides Derrick Henry (who was probably still in loading mode at the time), every other starting-caliber running back has drummed up big yardage against this soft Cardinal front. Meanwhile, Cleveland comes into the week boasting the league's best ground attack...

One more thing - last time winds were gusting over 20 miles per hour, Baker Mayfield had a sad outing.

#### _Weather_

60s weather, though some mean winds are expected

***

Browns -3

***

**Cleveland covers if**  
their rushers outgain Arizona's tailbacks by more than half a yard. Cleveland will need to allow its ground game take the lead on offense so long as winds render the passing game impotent.

**Arizona covers if**  
Chase Edmonds and James Conner can keep pace with Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt.

***

### Bills @ Titans (+5.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Bills** @ Chiefs  
**Titans** @ Bills

#### _Key Injuries_

It seems Tennessee is getting healthier on both sides of the ball, with key players practicing.

Same with Buffalo, as it seems Matt Milano is practicing now too.

#### _History_

Last year, Tennessee actually housed Buffalo in their match in Nashville. Odd considering how awful the Titans defense was last year. Very odd.

#### _Weather_

Crisp autumn weather

***

Bills -6

***

**Buffalo covers if**  
their defense can suppress the likes of Ryan Tannehill and Derrick Henry.

**Tennessee covers if**  
they repeat the same defensive strategy that was so resoundingly successful for them last year against this Buffalo squad. It seemed to be a strategy primarily built on limiting the deep pass  
\- AND -  
Buffalo comes out flat after an emotional win against a Kansas City team that stomped them in the playoffs last year  
\- AND -  
Tennessee comes out hot in a primetime showing against a Buffalo team people are crowning as the kings of the AFC.
