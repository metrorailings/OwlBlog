+++
Finally! We have a good week. My picks were pretty much on point. The Browns barely lost thanks to a foolish decision by Brandon Staley to not take a knee before kicking the field goal for a guaranteed win. Other than that, all my decisions were justified, mostly for reasons I listed in my analysis of each and every one. Beautiful!

Let's keep this up. Last week, I shied away from two matches that were originally appealing to me, thanks mostly to my early analysis of those matches. Let that be evidence that these breakdowns are fruitful in identifying potential games that may be traps.

## Chiefs @ Washington (+7)

#### _Latest Results_

**Bills** @ Chiefs  
**Saints** @ Washington

#### _Key Injuries_

Worth keeping an eye on the Chiefs. Both Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce suffered injuries last week, though none of their injuries are projected to hold them out.

#### _History_

No recent history, as these two teams play in different conferences.

#### _Weather_

Perfect spring scrimmage weather

Chiefs -7

**Kansas City covers if**  
Tyreek Hill posts over 120 yards against Washington's inept secondary  
\- AND -  
the defense can force some negative plays from Taylor Heinecke, who's known for playing fast and loose with the football.

**Washington covers if**  
Taylor Heinecke can minimize his recklessness  
\- OR -  
their defensive backs can keep Tyreek Hill bracketed for much of the game. A pretty tall ask considering the Washington secondary has discovered new ways to shit the bed every week this season.
