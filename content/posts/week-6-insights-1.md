## Buccaneers @ Eagles

This Buccaneer offense looks a little too different without Gronkowski. Brady needs Gronk more badly than I originally thought.

Lots of wide receiver and halfback screens being run by the Bucs. Maybe Brady and company are emphasizing that section of their playbook to counter the Eagles pass rush. Regardless of the reason, these screens have seen mixed success at best.

Brady with three bad throws in a row on a drive that ultimately ended in an interception. Little worrying.

Jalen Hurts is just awful. His throws lack touch. He does enjoy his sideline throws outside the numbers though. One fortuitously ended up in a pass interference call while the other led to an interception. The difference between the two was that Jamal Dean had his head turned around on the interception.

How is Jalen Hurts not finding anybody against this sad Tampa secondary?

Devontae Smith is something special for the Eagles. A critical piece.

## Cardinals @ Browns

Kyler magic is a very real thing this year.

Cleveland's offense is just feckless without Nick Chubb, a healthy Kareem Hunt, and Jarvis Landry. Without two of those three, expect the Browns to stall in the worst way.

Why does Baker insist on holding on to the ball ridiculously longer than necessary? Hero ball isn't a winning tactic in today's NFL.

Baker is who we thought he was.

## Bills @ Titans

Josh Allen missing quite a few open throws, notably to Emmanuel Sanders.

Tennessee is clearly amped for this game.

Good work by the Bills on blowing up the Titan bootlegs. Tannehill has been forced into some ugly moments when the edge rusher playing away from the shifting offensive line crashed down on the quarterback.

Derrick Henry stomping the Bills defense into oblivion here. It's clearly the impressive numbers Buffalo's defense built up early in the season are not a fair representation of the team's run defense.

Oddly enough, Buffalo is not all too keen to stack the box against Derrick Henry, even in the second half when it was all too obvious Henry was only building momentum.

Tennessee's pass protection is really concerning. Ryan Tannehill is almost always being rushed on his throws by the Bills defensive front. Not good. Good work by Mario Addison, Ed Oliver, and Rousseau.

## Bengals @ Lions

Bengals offense seem to have a difficult time working out of negative game script?

Goff seems to be operating on his first reads. Too many short passes and questionable throws attest to this.

Once again, Detroit's linebackers are so _slow_.

Cincinnati not afraid to send blitzers after Goff, perhaps in a bid to compel him to release the ball even faster than usual.

Trey Hendrickson is a beast so far.

Cincinnati's offensive line isn't much better than Detroit's, to be honest.

Burrow's mobility has been a difference maker so far.

Good to see the Bengals start the second half by establishing the run. Zac Taylor may finally understand the concept of adjustments...

Beautiful 4th down play from Zac Taylor. Use Detroit's defensive tendency to overreact to motion and impulse to surprise them with a wheel route from Joe Mixon.
