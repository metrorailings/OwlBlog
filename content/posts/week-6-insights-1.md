## Buccaneers @ Eagles

This Buccaneer offense looks a little too different without Gronkowski. Brady needs Gronk more badly than I originally thought.

Lots of wide receiver and halfback screens being run by the Bucs. Maybe Brady and company are emphasizing that section of their playbook to counter the Eagles pass rush. Regardless of the reason, these screens have seen mixed success at best.

Brady with three bad throws in a row on a drive that ultimately ended in an interception. Little worrying.

Jalen Hurts is just awful. His throws lack touch. He does enjoy his sideline throws outside the numbers though. One fortuitously ended up in a pass interference call while the other led to an interception. The difference between the two was that Jamal Dean had his head turned around on the interception.

How is Jalen Hurts not finding anybody against this sad Tampa secondary?

Devontae Smith is something special for the Eagles. A critical piece.

## Cardinals @ Browns

Kyler magic is a very real thing this year.

Cleveland's offense is just feckless without Nick Chubb, a healthy Kareem Hunt, and Jarvis Landry. Without two of those three, expect the Browns to stall in the worst way.

Why does Baker insist on holding on to the ball ridiculously longer than necessary? Hero ball isn't a winning tactic in today's NFL.

Baker is who we thought he was.
