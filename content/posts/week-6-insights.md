## Football Team @ Giants

Jones best throws might come against single-high man coverage. 

Daniel Jones running might be the best offensive vector for this team.

Joe Judge and Garrett focusing on running the ball in the 3rd quarter in order to dominate time of possession.

Washington's screens and short passes have been money so far.

Credit to Ron Rivera for some gutsy calls. I actually respect Washington's efforts more in this game than I do the Giants. Had it not been for a fortunate fumble return for a touchdown, Washington would have definitively won.

## Packers @ Buccaneers

Carlton Davis with a heroic play to blow up a screen where he was the only defender that needed to be blocked.

Packers may have the best offensive line in the league.

Brady still has issues being in sync with his receivers.

Packers love their slant routes, but Carlton Davis breaking one up leads to an interception returned for a (near) touchdown.

So far, I would say the Packers are winning at the point of impact against the Buccaneers and their run offense, despite their boxes being a little light.

Tampa Bay enjoys their receiver screens.

Second game in a row Gronkowski has reminded us he's still alive.

These blitzes are throwing Rodgers off his game.

No accepted penalties committed by Tampa Bay in the first half...wtf?

Three straight passes while up 21 points against a team that purposefully stacks a light box. Interesting. Perhaps the Bucs have given up on running against a Green Bay team that's been holding up well against Ronald Jones.

I don't think Green Bay has actually used the jet sweep despite running that jet sweep motion on multiple occasions.

One wonders how much of a role the humidity played on the Packers morale.

One also wonders whether Aaron Rodgers can operate well in negative game script or whether he's truly developed a rapport with anybody that's not Davonte Adams or Robert Tonyan. I can't forget that the Packers organization did absolutely nothing to augment the receiving weapons around Rodgers, instead opting to spend a first-round draft pick on a new quarterback.
