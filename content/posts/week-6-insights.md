## Football Team @ Giants

Jones best throws might come against single-high man coverage. 

Daniel Jones running might be the best offensive vector for this team.

Joe Judge and Garrett focusing on running the ball in the 3rd quarter in order to dominate time of possession.

Washington's screens and short passes have been money so far.

Credit to Ron Rivera for some gutsy calls. I actually respect Washington's efforts more in this game than I do the Giants. Had it not been for a fortunate fumble return for a touchdown, Washington would have definitively won.

## Packers @ Buccaneers

Carlton Davis with a heroic play to blow up a screen where he was the only defender that needed to be blocked.

Packers may have the best offensive line in the league.
