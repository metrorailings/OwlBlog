## Football Team @ Giants

Jones best throws might come against single-high man coverage.

Daniel Jones running might be the best offensive vector for this team.

Joe Judge and Garrett focusing on running the ball in the 3rd quarter in order to dominate time of possession.

Washington's screens and short passes have been money so far.

Credit to Ron Rivera for some gutsy calls. I actually respect Washington's efforts more in this game than I do the Giants. Had it not been for a fortunate fumble return for a touchdown, Washington would have definitively won.

## Packers @ Buccaneers

Carlton Davis with a heroic play to blow up a screen where he was the only defender that needed to be blocked.

Packers may have the best offensive line in the league.

Brady still has issues being in sync with his receivers.

Packers love their slant routes, but Carlton Davis breaking one up leads to an interception returned for a (near) touchdown.

So far, I would say the Packers are winning at the point of impact against the Buccaneers and their run offense, despite their boxes being a little light.

Tampa Bay enjoys their receiver screens.

Second game in a row Gronkowski has reminded us he's still alive.

These blitzes are throwing Rodgers off his game.

No accepted penalties committed by Tampa Bay in the first half...wtf?

Three straight passes while up 21 points against a team that purposefully stacks a light box. Interesting. Perhaps the Bucs have given up on running against a Green Bay team that's been holding up well against Ronald Jones.

I don't think Green Bay has actually used the jet sweep despite running that jet sweep motion on multiple occasions.

One wonders how much of a role the humidity played on the Packers morale.

One also wonders whether Aaron Rodgers can operate well in negative game script or whether he's truly developed a rapport with anybody that's not Davonte Adams or Robert Tonyan. I can't forget that the Packers organization did absolutely nothing to augment the receiving weapons around Rodgers, instead opting to spend a first-round draft pick on a new quarterback.

## Falcons @ Vikings

Julio Jones bailed the Falcons out on a long third down.

AJ Terrell finally playing well, it seems.

Falcons embracing 3rd-down runs with the hope of an easier 4th down attempt.

Falcons are still a little off in their execution and their attention to detail. But a turnaround seems to be in sight here.

The Falcons defense with that impressive four-down goal-line stand...maybe I was wrong. Maybe Dan Quinn was really holding this defense back from realizing its full potential.  Either that or Raheem Morris reorganizing the defensive coaching staff has changed the way this defense exhibits intensity.

It's worth mentioning Julio Jones takes this offense to another level when fully healthy.

## Rams @ 49ers

Nothing but screens, runs, and jet sweeps on the first drive for the 49ers. I really hope the Rams defense adjusts, but it worries me to see them give way so easily.

Rams offensive game plan relies on Goff passing the ball with touch. I am worried.

Rams seem to be concentrating so much more on pass coverage than box defense. Seems like their base defense is a nickel formation.

The Rams simply hate fielding players in traditional linebacker roles. How are more teams not running roughshod over this Rams defense using a combination of short passes and runs?

Fred Warner has been awesome in defending against the run.

Raheem Mostert is a beast.

Rams and their lack of box defenders opening leading to some easy passes for Jimmy Garoppalo right over the middle.

Maybe Los Angeles' defense is modeling itself as a "bend, don't break" style of defense....

San Francisco's offensive line is holding up ridiculously well against the Rams defensive front.

McVay genuinely believes in Jared Goff's ability here, given the way the initial set of scripted plays had him passing from shotgun. Very concerning going forward.

Emmanuel Mosely and Jason Verrett are difference makers as two of the three primary cover-three defenders.

## Broncos @ Patriots

Drew Lock on his first pass airs it out for huge yardage. I think his shoulder is fine.

In fact, nothing, but big pass attempts from Drew Lock on the first drive. I think Denver is hoping the Patriots would be playing shorter routes given Lock's shoulder injuries. Good try by Pat Shurmur to prey upon expectations. But kudos to Bill Belichick for training his defensive backs well.

Offensive line breaking down in protection led to Cam Newton being "intercepted".

Broncos seem to be using run blitzes to cut the Patriot rushes short. So far though, New England has been executing on their exotic run packages.

Anthony Chickillo with two big impact plays when rushing the passer.

Crossing routes seem to be working well for Denver against New England's man coverage defenders. Nothing else seems to work though. New England's defenders are winning bigly.

The Patriots may have serious issues along their offensive line.
