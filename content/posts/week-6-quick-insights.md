## Seahawks @ Browns

The Browns are just hot garbage, starting with Baker Mayfield.

To start, Baker threw two passes behind his receivers that ended up being picked. He also threw another interception early in the game that stunted some of the momentum the Browns built up out of the gate. Nick Chubb also fumbled the ball on another critical drive during the second half.

The coaching on a Browns drive that ended at the Seahawks goal line was atrocious. Freddie Kitchens made a series of bumbling moves on that drive, calling a fade pass on a 3rd down and then calling a bizarre-looking slant on 4th down. Despite the weird play on 4th down, Cleveland was bailed out  thanks to the Seattle defense committing a silly pre-snap penalty. But then Kitchens proceeded to throw the challenge flag as _his team ran their second 4th down play_. It was a challenge that ultimately failed, but then the Browns clumsily tried running the same play from before, only to be shut out from the end zone as the Seattle defense adjusted once Cleveland showed their hand earlier before.

The Seahawks were able to exert their will over the Browns defense, mostly on the ground. Chris Carson was a force, breaking tackles and churning out additional yards after contact. Cleveland needs to be more disciplined in their tackling. Some conditioning would also help as well.

Penalties were still an issue for this team, though a few of the penalties charged against the Browns looked a little spurious.

I have to stop picking bad teams unless those teams are taking more than 3 points.
