## Seahawks @ Browns

The Browns are just hot garbage, starting with Baker Mayfield.

To start, Baker threw two passes behind his receivers that ended up being picked. He also threw another interception early in the game that stunted some of the momentum the Browns built up out of the gate. Nick Chubb also fumbled the ball on another critical drive during the second half.

The coaching on a Browns drive that ended at the Seahawks goal line was atrocious. Freddie Kitchens made a series of bumbling moves on that drive, calling a fade pass on a 3rd down and then calling a bizarre-looking slant on 4th down. Despite the weird play on 4th down, Cleveland was bailed out  thanks to the Seattle defense committing a silly pre-snap penalty. But then Kitchens proceeded to throw the challenge flag as _his team ran their second 4th down play_. It was a challenge that ultimately failed, but then the Browns clumsily tried running the same play from before, only to be shut out from the end zone as the Seattle defense adjusted once Cleveland showed their hand earlier before.

The Seahawks were able to exert their will over the Browns defense, mostly on the ground. Chris Carson was a force, breaking tackles and churning out additional yards after contact. Cleveland needs to be more disciplined in their tackling. Some conditioning would also help as well.

Penalties were still an issue for this team, though a few of the penalties charged against the Browns looked a little spurious.

I have to stop picking bad teams unless those teams are taking more than 3 points.

Only thing worth praising for the Browns are their scripted play. It was those plays that led to Cleveland taking a double-digit lead halfway through the game.

## 49ers @ Rams

I should be more wary of teams that can win in dominating fashion without much help from their quarterback. This Niners team is something special, even if Jimmy Garoppalo is off every now and then.

Man coverage isn't doing much against these 49ers. Kyle Shanahan is countering the Rams defensive coverage looks with bunch formations, from the few plays I did get a good look at.

The 49ers defense have hit their stride. Their aggressive man coverage and trench play is paying off in spades today.

Kyle Shanahan is pathologically conservative once he has a safe lead.

## Eagles @ Vikings

The Vikings were able to make hay on the first drive through some end-around trickery and outside runs. Eagles defensive line also having a hard time pressuring Cousins on the drive.

If there's one thing going in favor for the Eagles defense, it's that the front is holding up well against inside runs between the tackles.

Three straight runs for the Eagles offense, leading to a three-and-out on their first drive. The writing is on the wall, for fuck's sake.

Two drives - Cousins hasn't been all too impressive outside of one throw to Thielan down the middle of the field. Eagles having trouble getting pressure with their standard personnel however...which helps.

Jason Peters not playing left tackle may be a serious liability for the Eagles.

Outside runs are a serious problem for this Eagles front seven.

Finally, Kirk Cousins is discovering the deep ball again. Two home run balls to Stefon Diggs to put his Vikings up over 20 points. Main takeaway here is that Kirk Cousins has rediscovered his former penchant for the big play. Pretty similar to what I saw last year when the Vikings played Philadelphia at Lincoln Financial Field.

Eagles playing a good amount of zone defense.

Finally, Vikings are breaking out in the second half. Kirk Cousins making passes under pressure and the team finally using their two best skill players in creative and purposeful ways.
