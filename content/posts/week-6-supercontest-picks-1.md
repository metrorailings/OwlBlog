#### _Latest Results_

Colts (23) @ **Browns** (32)  
Eagles (29) @ **Steelers** (38)

#### _Record_

Browns (4-1)   
Steelers (4-0)

#### _Injuries_

On Cleveland's side, the only major concern comes at quarterback, as Baker was roughed up last week with a rib shot. His ribs haven't shown any cracks on x-ray, so he'll likely play on Heinz Field this Sunday with some padding around his abdominal area.

On Pittsburgh's side, their offensive line is likely to take a hit with David DeCastro sidelined with an abdominal issue of his own.
