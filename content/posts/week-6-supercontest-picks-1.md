### Browns @ Steelers (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Colts (23) @ **Browns** (32)  
Eagles (29) @ **Steelers** (38)

#### _Record_

Browns (4-1)   
Steelers (4-0)

#### _Injuries_

On Cleveland's side, the only major concern comes at quarterback, as Baker was roughed up last week with a rib shot. His ribs haven't shown any cracks on x-ray, so he'll likely play on Heinz Field this Sunday with some padding around his abdominal area.

On Pittsburgh's side, their offensive line is likely to take a hit with David DeCastro sidelined with an abdominal issue of his own. Center Maurkice Pouncey also remains a point of concern.

#### _History_

No relevant history here. This game will mark the first time Stefanski will play against Tomlin's Steelers. As far as I'm aware, Pittsburgh and its coaches haven't really faced a Kubiak-style offense in the past two years.

> Steelers -3

Having watched Pittsburgh in action last week, I see them running a pretty crisp passing offense. Cleveland's passing offense still remains a bit of a work in progress, though Stefanski's scripted plays and the bootleg concepts have been paying serious dividends over the past few games. Baker still has yet to fully find his groove in this Kubiak-inspired offense.

I don't expect this game to be the one where Baker finally develops a rhythm. This Steelers team arguably features the best pass rush in the league. Given his past history dealing with pressure, Baker will likely struggle, especially if his ribs are still sore from the last game.
