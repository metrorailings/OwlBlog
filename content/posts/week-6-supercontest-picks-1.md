### Browns @ Steelers (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Colts (23) @ **Browns** (32)  
Eagles (29) @ **Steelers** (38)

#### _Record_

Browns (4-1)  
Steelers (4-0)

#### _Injuries_

On Cleveland's side, a major concern comes at quarterback, as Baker was roughed up last week with a rib shot. His ribs haven't shown any cracks on x-ray, so he'll likely play on Heinz Field this Sunday with some padding around his abdominal area. Another major concern is Nick Chubb. Chubb is a generational talent the team will sorely miss over the next several weeks. Kareem Hunt simply can't replace his ability to break tackles or shift direction.

On Pittsburgh's side, their offensive line is likely to take a hit with David DeCastro sidelined with an abdominal issue of his own. Center Maurkice Pouncey also remains a point of concern.

#### _History_

No relevant history here. This game will mark the first time Stefanski will play against Tomlin's Steelers. As far as I'm aware, Pittsburgh and its coaches haven't really faced a Kubiak-style offense in the past two years.

Steelers -3

**Pittsburgh covers if**  
the defensive line manages to roughs up Baker Mayfield to the point where Cleveland's passing game is borderline dysfunctional. To this end, it would help if Pittsburgh's league-leading run defense can shut down Kareem Hunt, similar to what Indianapolis did last week.

**Cleveland covers if**  
Kareem Hunt and the offensive line run roughshod over Pittsburgh's defense, giving the Browns offense another way to attack this defense without exposing their injured quarterback.

### Texans @ Titans (-3)

#### _Latest Results_

Jaguars (14) @ **Texans** (30)  
Bills (16) @ **Titans** (42)

#### _Record_

Texans (1-4)  
Titans (4-0)

#### _Injuries_

On Houston's side, the loss of interior linebacker Benardrick McKinney is more concerning than one would think. The Texans defense has been playing like broken turnstiles against the run this season. Opposing rushers that don't wear Jacksonville's colors have been gashing them for big yardage. Losing their best run defender (on paper) doesn't help them in this regard.

On Tennessee's side, I don't see much concern. Yes, some players still remain sidelined with COVID infections, but it didn't really hinder them much against Buffalo last week, did it?

#### _History_

The last time these two teams danced in Nashville, Houston was able to pull out a win, though the box scores indicates the two played a tight game.

Titans -3

**Tennessee covers if**  
This Houston defensive unit continues rolling out the red carpet for opposing rushers. If Derrick Henry can finally rediscover his groove here, expect an offensive explosion from Tennessee.

**Houston covers if**  
the Texans defense can keep Derrick Henry from blowing the doors off here and the offense finally finds an identity. So long as the defense can limit Tennessee's ground attack, Deshaun Watson and the offense should have enough opportunities to keep pace with Ryan Tannehill. Whether they'll make good on those opportunities depends on how well the offense meshes under Tim Kelly two weeks removed from the tyranny of Bill O'Brien. It would help if Kelly's finally abandons inside zone runs for outside zone runs.

### Falcons @ Vikings (-3.5)

#### _Latest Results_

**Panthers** (23) @ Falcons (16)  
Vikings (26) @ **Seahawks** (27)

#### _Record_

Falcons (0-5)  
Vikings (1-4)

#### _Injuries_

The Vikings will be missing the services of their starting halfback in Dalvin Cook. Alexander Mattison performed well in relief duty last week, so I'm positive Minnesota won't be losing much traction in the ground game. Offensive guard Dru Samia has also been ruled out, though this may be a case of addition by subtraction, if you ask me.

Atlanta will be missing the services of their second best pass rusher in Tak McKinley.

#### _History_

Last year, these two teams met in the opening week of the season. Minnesota dominated that game by leaning very heavily on its ground game.

Besides that, Atlanta also faced Green Bay a few weeks ago. Generally speaking, Green Bay and Minnesota run somewhat similar offenses. Just like last year's match with Minnesota, things didn't go well for Atlanta. Even though Green Bay only won by two scores, the game was more or less a blowout from a scripting point of view.

***

Vikings -3.5

***

**Minnesota covers if**  
Alexander Mattison can keep Minnesota's run game chugging smoothly against a middling Falcons defense. Unlike Atlanta, Minnesota has won a game this season and has been competitive in multiple games against solid teams, which tells me Minnesota has that winning mettle Atlanta so clearly lacks.

**Atlanta covers if**  
the firing of Dan Quinn motivates this team to immediately turn its fortunes around. While Atlanta's problems go beyond Dan Quinn, the fact remains Quinn has been a point of failure contributing to this team's woes. Still, a sudden turnaround necessitates Matt Ryan playing much better. Hard to see that happening in the span of a week.

### Broncos @ Patriots (-10)

#### _Latest Results_

Patriots (10) @ **Chiefs** (26)  
**Broncos** (37) @ Jets (28)

#### _Record_

Broncos (1-3)  
Patriots (2-2)

#### _Injuries_

While the Patriots will likely have nobody critical sidelined, certain players have been dealing with nagging injuries, namely a few offensive linemen and Julian Edelman. I wonder if these injuries will surface during the game.

The Broncos have lost some key folk for the entire season, most importantly Jurrell Casey and Courtland Sutton. Their absences will be felt. For this game, the most significant question mark is Noah Fant. Fant's presence on the field would definitely help, although I suppose this offense can run through a combination of Jerry Jeudy, Tim Patrick, and Phillip Lindsay. Then again, a lot of these injuries on offense become meaningless if Drew Lock is seriously hindered by his nagging shoulder injury.

#### _History_

It's hard to find comparables here. Denver never faced an offense that prioritized the rushing attack over the passing game. Likewise, Denver never faced a defensive secondary loaded with so much talent.

New England has faced a west coast style of offense earlier in the year when they played Kansas City. Even though the Patriots were ultimately blown out, New England was actually able to contain the Chiefs for nearly three quarters. The Patriots know what they're doing on offense.

***

Broncos +10

***

**Denver covers if**  
Vic Fangio's defense can stop the Patriots from running the ball at will and Drew Lock is mostly functional coming back from a shoulder injury.

**New England covers if**  
Cam Newton and the Patriot tailbacks force their will against Denver's defensive front. It would also be a tremendous help if Drew Lock's out there throwing ducks because of his bad shoulder.

### Cardinals @ Cowboys (+2)

#### _Latest Results_

**Cardinals** (30) @ Jets (10)  
Giants (34) @ **Cowboys** (37)

#### _Record_

Cardinals (3-2)  
Cowboys (2-3)

#### _Injuries_

Even though the Cowboys active roster is expected to be mostly healthy going into this game, the real concern is that so many of their key players are out for the season. Going beyond Dak here, three of their starting offensive linemen have been placed on IR. Both of their starting cornerbacks are just returning from injury, as is their starting linebacker Leighton Vander-Esch. So Dallas is still undermanned here along multiple critical positions.

Arizona may be missing the services of a starting guard, but more importantly, the team will be without its best pass rusher in Chandler Jones going forward. Without Jones, the team will rely upon Haasan Reddick amd Devon Kennard to sustain their pass rush. In other words, expect the Cardinals to quickly become one of the worst teams when it comes to pressuring opposing quarterbacks.
