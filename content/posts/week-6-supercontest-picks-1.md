### Browns @ Steelers (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Colts (23) @ **Browns** (32)  
Eagles (29) @ **Steelers** (38)

#### _Record_

Browns (4-1)  
Steelers (4-0)

#### _Injuries_

On Cleveland's side, a major concern comes at quarterback, as Baker was roughed up last week with a rib shot. His ribs haven't shown any cracks on x-ray, so he'll likely play on Heinz Field this Sunday with some padding around his abdominal area. Another major concern is Nick Chubb. Chubb is a generational talent the team will sorely miss over the next several weeks. Kareem Hunt simply can't replace his ability to break tackles or shift direction.

On Pittsburgh's side, their offensive line is likely to take a hit with David DeCastro sidelined with an abdominal issue of his own. Center Maurkice Pouncey also remains a point of concern.

#### _History_

No relevant history here. This game will mark the first time Stefanski will play against Tomlin's Steelers. As far as I'm aware, Pittsburgh and its coaches haven't really faced a Kubiak-style offense in the past two years.

> Steelers -3

**Pittsburgh covers if**  
the defensive line manages to roughs up Baker Mayfield to the point where Cleveland's passing game is borderline dysfunctional. To this end, it would help if Pittsburgh's league-leading run defense can shut down Kareem Hunt, similar to what Indianapolis did last week.

**Cleveland covers if**  
Kareem Hunt and the offensive line run roughshod over Pittsburgh's defense, giving the Browns offense another way to attack this defense without exposing their injured quarterback.

### Texans @ Titans (-3)

#### _Latest Results_

Jaguars (14) @ **Texans** (30)  
Bills (16) @ **Titans** (42)

#### _Record_

Texans (1-4)  
Titans (4-0)

#### _Injuries_

On Houston's side, the loss of interior linebacker Benardrick McKinney is more concerning than one would think. The Texans defense has been playing like broken turnstiles against the run this season. Opposing rushers that don't wear Jacksonville's colors have been gashing them for big yardage. Losing their single best run defender doesn't help them in this regard.

On Tennessee's side, I don't see much concern. Yes, some players still remain sidelined with COVID infections, but it didn't really hinder them much against Buffalo last week, did it?

#### _History_

The last time these two teams danced in Nashville, Houston was able to pull out a win, though the box scores indicates the two played a tight game.

> Titans -3

**Tennessee covers if**  
This Houston defensive unit continues rolling out the red carpet for opposing rushers. If Derrick Henry can finally rediscover his groove here, expect an offensive explosion from Tennessee.

**Houston covers if**  
the Texans defense can keep Derrick Henry from blowing the doors off here and the offense finally finds an identity. So long as the defense can limit Tennessee's ground attack, Deshaun Watson and the offense should have enough opportunities to keep pace with Ryan Tannehill. Whether they'll make good on those opportunities depends on how well the offense meshes under Tim Kelly two weeks removed from the tyranny of Bill O'Brien.

### Falcons @ Vikings (-3.5)

#### _Latest Results_

**Panthers** (23) @ Falcons (16)  
Vikings (26) @ **Seahawks** (27)

#### _Record_

Falcons (0-5)  
Vikings (1-4)

#### _Injuries_

The Vikings will be missing the services of their starting halfback in Dalvin Cook. Alexander Mattison performed well in relief duty last week, so I'm positive Minnesota won't be losing much traction in the ground game without Dalvin Cook. Offensive guard Dru Samia has also been ruled out, though this may be a case of addition by subtraction, if you ask me.

Atlanta will be missing the services of their second best pass rusher in Tak McKinley.

#### _History_

Last year, these two teams met in the opening week of the season. Minnesota dominated that game by leaning very heavily on its ground game.

Besides that, Atlanta also faced Green Bay a few weeks ago. From a high-level point of view, Green Bay and Minnesota run somewhat similar offenses. Just like last year's match with Minnesota, things didn't go well for Atlanta. Even though Green Bay ultimately won by two scores, the game was more or less a blowout from a scripting point of view.
