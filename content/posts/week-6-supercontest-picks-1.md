### Browns @ Steelers (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Colts (23) @ **Browns** (32)  
Eagles (29) @ **Steelers** (38)

#### _Record_

Browns (4-1)   
Steelers (4-0)

#### _Injuries_

On Cleveland's side, the only major concern comes at quarterback, as Baker was roughed up last week with a rib shot. His ribs haven't shown any cracks on x-ray, so he'll likely play on Heinz Field this Sunday with some padding around his abdominal area.

On Pittsburgh's side, their offensive line is likely to take a hit with David DeCastro sidelined with an abdominal issue of his own. Center Maurkice Pouncey also remains a point of concern.

#### _History_

No relevant history here. This game will mark the first time Stefanski will play against Tomlin's Steelers. As far as I'm aware, Pittsburgh and its coaches haven't really faced a Kubiak-style offense in the past two years.

> Steelers -3

Having watched Pittsburgh in action last week, I see them running a pretty crisp passing offense. Cleveland's passing offense still remains a bit of a work in progress, though Stefanski's scripted plays and the bootleg concepts have been paying serious dividends over the past few games. 

I don't expect Baker to finally find his groove in this offense against a Steelers defense almost certainly featuring the best pass rush in the league.
