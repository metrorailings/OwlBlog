### Browns @ Steelers (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Colts (23) @ **Browns** (32)  
Eagles (29) @ **Steelers** (38)

#### _Record_

Browns (4-1)   
Steelers (4-0)

#### _Injuries_

On Cleveland's side, a major concern comes at quarterback, as Baker was roughed up last week with a rib shot. His ribs haven't shown any cracks on x-ray, so he'll likely play on Heinz Field this Sunday with some padding around his abdominal area. Another major concern is Nick Chubb. Chubb is a generational talent the team will sorely miss over the next several weeks. Kareem Hunt simply can't replace his ability to break tackles or shift direction.

On Pittsburgh's side, their offensive line is likely to take a hit with David DeCastro sidelined with an abdominal issue of his own. Center Maurkice Pouncey also remains a point of concern.

#### _History_

No relevant history here. This game will mark the first time Stefanski will play against Tomlin's Steelers. As far as I'm aware, Pittsburgh and its coaches haven't really faced a Kubiak-style offense in the past two years.

> Steelers -3

**Pittsburgh covers if  
**the defensive line manages to roughs up Baker Mayfield to the point where Cleveland's passing game is borderline dysfunctional. To this end, it would help if Pittsburgh's league-leading run defense can shut down Kareem Hunt, similar to what Indianapolis did last week.

**Cleveland covers if**  
Kareem Hunt and the offensive line run roughshod over Pittsburgh's defense, giving the Browns offense another way to attack this defense without exposing their injured quarterback.
