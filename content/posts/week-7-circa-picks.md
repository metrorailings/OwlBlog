headline = "Week 7 Circa Picks "

+++
Not a bad week last week. Three of my picks were sound while two were disgustingly wrong.

But lesson learned - don't underestimate the impact of injuries, especially when it comes to quarterbacks. Lingering quarterback injuries combined with reduced weaponry on offense can lead to grim results. It's clear Daniel Jones isn't quite himself coming off the concussion. On top of that, in no circumstance should Baker Mayfield be counted to shoulder the burden of offense when Cleveland's without either of its star rushers.

#### _Key Injuries_

Robert Quinn is an important player to keep an eye on, given his role on Chicago's defense. He'll need to pass COVID protocol before he can travel with his brothers-in-arms over to Tampa. Without him, the Bears defense suffers a massive hit to its defense at the most inopportune time.

Tampa Bay remains banged up. Rob Gronkowski, Jason Pierre-Paul, Antonio Brown, and Lavante David haven't been practicing, putting their chances of playing this weekend in jeopardy. A few of these players should be able to play, though it remains uncertain exactly who. Gronk and JPP would be the most impactful names coming off injury.  

#### _History_

Tampa and Chicago met last year in a primetime moment on Soldier Field. The Bears eked out a win against a Buccaneer team still cutting its teeth in the Brady era. From what I remember, Brady's offensive linemen failed him on multiple occasions. The only reason the game remained competitive was because Nick Foles kept missing open throws to his receivers. 

#### _Weather_

Seasonably hot and gently humid

Buccaneers -12.5

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
Brady and the offense aren't caught slacking against a clearly inferior team. Tampa will be given enough opportunities on offense to score points, it's just a matter of whether the will is there to run up the score  
\- OR -  
The Buccaneers enter the game with all their key injured players active.

**Chicago covers if**  
their offense can somehow score at least 17 points against Tampa's defense. Certainly possible if the Buccaneers end up stalling too much against Chicago's top-tier defense.

#### _Key Injuries_

Baltimore will be missing the services of a capable offensive lineman in Ronnie Stanley.

Cincinnati should be mostly healthy, though Joe Burrow is still fighting through a neck contusion limiting his vocal cadences.

#### _History_

Twice did these teams face one another last year. Both times, Baltimore kept Cincinnati to its worst offensive showing that season (in terms of scoring). Wink Martindale seems to have a beat on Zac Taylor's offense. 

#### _Weather_

Perfect autumn weather

Undecided

**Cincinnati covers if**  
their offensive line can hold up against the myriad of blitzes and rushes Martindale will throw at them.

**Baltimore covers if**  
their defensive front can prevent a hurting Joe Burrow from ever settling into a groove.
