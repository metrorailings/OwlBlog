draft = true
headline = "Week 7 Circa Picks "

+++
Not a bad week last week. Three of my picks were sound while two were disgustingly wrong.

But lesson learned - don't underestimate the impact of injuries, especially when it comes to quarterbacks. Lingering quarterback injuries combined with reduced weaponry on offense can lead to grim results. It's clear Daniel Jones isn't quite himself coming off the concussion. On top of that, in no circumstance should Baker Mayfield be counted to shoulder the burden of offense when Cleveland's without either of its star rushers.

### Bears @ Buccaneers (-12.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Packers** @ Bears  
**Buccaneers** @ Eagles (TNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

Robert Quinn is an important player to keep an eye on, given his role on Chicago's defense. He'll need to pass COVID protocol before he can travel with his brothers-in-arms over to Tampa. Without him, the Bears defense suffers a massive hit to its defense at the most inopportune time.

Tampa Bay remains banged up. Rob Gronkowski, Jason Pierre-Paul, Antonio Brown, and Lavante David haven't been practicing, putting their chances of playing this weekend in jeopardy. A few of these players should be able to play, though it remains uncertain exactly who. Gronk and JPP would be the most impactful names coming off injury.  

#### _History_

Tampa and Chicago met last year in a primetime moment on Soldier Field. The Bears eked out a win against a Buccaneer team still cutting its teeth in the Brady era. From what I remember, Brady's offensive linemen failed him on multiple occasions. On top of that, Tampa was missing so many of its weapons. The only reason the game remained competitive was because Nick Foles kept missing open throws to his receivers. 

#### _Weather_

Seasonably hot and gently humid

***

Buccaneers -12.5

***

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
Brady and the offense aren't caught slacking against a clearly inferior team. Tampa will be given enough opportunities on offense to score points, it's just a matter of whether the will is there to run up the score  
\- OR -  
The Buccaneers enter the game with all their key injured players active.

**Chicago covers if**  
their offense can somehow score at least 17 points against Tampa's defense. Certainly possible if the Buccaneers end up stalling too much against Chicago's top-tier defense. Robert Quinn coming back would be an incredibly positive development for the Bears.

### Bengals @ Ravens (-6.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Bengals** @ Lions  
Chargers @ **Ravens**

#### _Key Injuries_

Baltimore will be missing the services of a capable offensive lineman in Ronnie Stanley.

Cincinnati should be mostly healthy, though Joe Burrow is still fighting through a neck contusion limiting his vocal cadences.

#### _History_

Twice did these teams face one another last year. Both times, Baltimore kept Cincinnati to its worst offensive showing that season (in terms of scoring). Wink Martindale seems to have a beat on Zac Taylor's offense. 

#### _Weather_

Perfect autumn weather

***

Undecided

***

**Cincinnati covers if**  
their offensive line can hold up against the myriad of blitzes and rushes Martindale will throw at them.

**Baltimore covers if**  
their defensive front can prevent a hurting Joe Burrow from ever settling into a groove.

### Chiefs @ Titans (+4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Chiefs** @ Washington  
Bills @ **Titans** (MNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

AJ Brown hasn't been practicing so far this week, citing illness as the reason he's been sidelined. I wonder just how badly that episode of food poisoning got to him last weekend.

The Chiefs two most critical pieces on offense outside Patrick Mahomes remain banged up, though both Kelce and Hill are expected to play this Sunday.

#### _History_

These teams faced one another twice two years ago, but nothing more recent than that. Both of those contests were competitive, though Kansas City won decisively in the rematch.

One thing's for certain - Tennessee's ground game still has as much teeth today as it did years ago against Kansas. That doesn't bode well for a Chiefs defense clearly in decline.

#### _Weather_

Warm weather with some light winds

***

Titans +4.5

***

**Tennessee covers if**  
Ryan Tannehill and his sad offensive line can negotiate through the blitzes Spagnuolo and his defense will present to him.

**Kansas City covers if**  
Their defense can harangue Tannehill on enough plays  
\- OR -  
Tyreek Hill is healthy enough to play the whole game without any issue. Tennessee's soft secondary is begging to be scorched by a player of his caliber.

***

### Falcons @ Dolphins (+2.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Falcons - BYE  
Dolphins vs **Jaguars** (London)

#### _Key Injuries_

Dante Fowler is out for the Falcons.

Miami is banged up across the spectrum. Notably, all three starting cornerbacks are dealing with injuries throwing their game-time status into question. Likewise, DaVante Parker being a perpetual presence on the injury list throws his availability into question as well. 

#### _History_

No real history. Neither of the two head coaches here have squared off against one another recently too.

#### _Weather_

Hot and humid. Just lovely weather for Miami, but not so lovely for the road team coming out of town.

***

Dolphins +2.5

***

**Miami covers if**  
Xavien Howard and Byron Jones suit up and play through most of the game.

**Atlanta covers if**  
Miami's injured secondary fails to show up for the better part of the game.

### Jets @ Patriots (-7)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Jets - BYE  
**Cowboys** @ Patriots

#### _Key Injuries_

New York will be missing the services of their top-flight linebacker in C.J. Mosley.

New England seems mostly healthy. Their offensive line seems to be coming together.

#### _History_

These two faced one another earlier in the season. New England embarrassed New York in a rout, exposing Zach Wilson's lack of experience. The Jets did impress on defense - it took considerable work for the Patriots to finally nail the cover.

#### _Weather_

Typical autumn weather for New England

***

Jets +7

***

**New York covers if**  
Zach Wilson and his coaches learn from their past outing against Belichick and simplify things on offense against a New England defense known to confuse rookie quarterbacks.

**New England covers if**  
their defense can once again frustrate an aimless New York offense helmed by a coordinator and a rookie passer still cutting their teeth. 

***

### Colts @ 49ers (-4)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Texans @ **Colts**  
49ers - BYE

#### _Key Injuries_

The 49ers are without their best skill player in George Kittle. Even more worrisome is that an injured Jimmy Garoppalo will be helming the offense, with some scrub backing him up should he go down.

Braden Smith will once again be out of action for the Colts. 

#### _History_

No recent history between these two organizations or their coaches.  Kyle Shanahan did face off against Carson Wentz last year in a game where the latter led his team to a surprise upset.

#### _Weather_

Rainy and windy. Fun times. Expect both teams to dedicate more resources towards defensing the run.

***

Undecided

***

**Indianapolis covers if**  
their run game outperforms San Francisco's own ground attack in terms of yards per carry. It'll likely depend on whether Carson Wentz can present himself as a credible threat, thereby compelling the 49ers to allocate more defenders outside the box. 

**San Francisco covers if**  
their ground game gains more yards per carry than that of the Colts.
