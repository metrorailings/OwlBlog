content = "And here we are, after a 3-1-1 showing last week in the Supercontest. I actually feel good, even though my odds of landing in the money are pretty damn slim at this point. Still, let's see if we can hit at least 4 wins this week. So with that said, let's proceed with my picks.\n\n***\n\n##### Browns @ Buccaneers (-3)\n\nA little hard for me to put top American dollar on Jameis Winston, but the Buccaneers have too much of an offensive edge over the Browns here, despite the recent emergence of Baker Mayfield as the franchise quarterback the Browns have sought for generations now. Mayfield is still a rookie finding his sea legs, and he hasn't had much help as of late given that his receiving weapons have been letting him down recently. On top of that, the team is managed by the worst coach in the league in Foo Jackson, and I'd be shocked if he actually made some serious adjustments to try and rectify his team's offensive woes.\n\nThe reality is that the Buccaneers are simply better coached and better able to produce yards compared to the Browns. Now I know, I know....that defense. That defense can't stop leaves blowing gently in the wind, let alone professional NFL offenses. But with that being said, the firing of Mike Smith on Monday may be the impetus this defense needs to actually step up and perform well, if only for one week. A decent man lost his job because of their sorry performance, and that cannot sit well with them.\n\n***\n\n##### Titans (+6.5) @ Chargers (_London_)\n\nThe Titans were humiliated in wicked fashion last week in their shut-out loss against the Ravens. Nothing illustrates the magnitude of their loss better than the fact that Tennessee gave up 11 sacks while only completing 10 passes. Savage.\n\nOn the other hand, the Chargers are fresh off a dominant win over the Browns. Not only were the Chargers fairly proficient on offense last week, but that defensive line finally found its groove again, racking up nine hits on Baker Mayfield.\n\nThat being said...the Elo model is in love with the Titans here. And I understand why. The Chargers stock is at a season high, whereas the Titans stock is at a season low. If let-down spots are truly a thing in the National Football League, then this may be one such spot for the Chargers. Especially as I have serious doubts about Anthony Lynn's ability to coach his team to succeed consistently. Its during weeks like these when coaching becomes really critical. And the second-year head coach will be challenged to keep his team level-headed as they travel across several time zones to a foreign land full of distracting tourist locales."
