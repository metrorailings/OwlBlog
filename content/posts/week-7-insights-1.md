## Broncos @ Browns

D'Ernest Johnson is the man. Talk about stepping adequately in Nick Chubb's shoes.

Even with Case Keenum at the helm, Jarvis Landry is still more integral to this offense compared to Odell.

Teddy is playing...weird. What's up with him? Preferring short passes, underselling long passes...

Beckham is worthless. D'Ernest though...he's a beast.

At least in their opening drive on the second half, Denver seemed to connect more on intermediate routes and quick blitz reads.

## Panthers @ Giants

Darnold has issues. Confidence issues, maybe?

Kyle Rudolph still has some gas in his tank.

Carolina has drop issues, but Darnold isn't helping with his erratic throws. How is he this bad?

I think Daniel Jones is over his concussion.

Giants offensive line is still shit though.

Has Darnold woken up now after an excellent bootleg throw to DJ Moore? Nope...never mind. He threw a terrible interception on a 3rd and long.

It speaks volumes when the Panthers prefer passing the ball with Darnold rather than run the ball with Hubbard.

I love seeing the Giants roll the pocket against this fierce Panthers pass rush. Well done.

## Jets @ Patriots

Zach Wilson injured early. Jets are dead in the water.

Jets are still pathetic. Seems like New England has done more to prepare for this game than the Jets, given how quickly Mac Jones is releasing the ball. Just have him hold on to the rock for a tick longer, Saleh.

## Falcons @ Dolphins

This Dolphin defense is pathetic on the opening drive of the second half. No real pass rush, busted coverage, lack of physicality...

Finally, Miami is producing something thanks to judicious use of the hurry-up offense as well as some clutch play from Tua. Atlanta's defense needs to be ashamed of itself here.

## Eagles @ Raiders

Derek Carr needs to be lauded for his aggressiveness.

But there we go - the Eagles mount some pressure and Carr throws an ill-advised pass resulting in an interception.

Yannick Ngakoue showing up now. Well done.

Good to see Eagles commit more to the run. Only problem is that Miles Sanders is injured. Neither of the other halfbacks on the other roster are as dynamic as Sanders. Still, Philadelphia running the ball should theoretically pay dividends come the fourth quarter.

Carr has 15 completions in his first 16 throws. Not good for Philly's defense. Carr has hit a different gear now that bum Gruden has been run out of town. On top of that, the predictability of Philly's defense has made things fairly easy to read for Carr. Less time spent thinking is more time spent acting.

It amazes me how sloppy these Eagles are in terms of penalties and ball control. I'm starting to realize sloppy teams don't travel well on the road.

Why do I take sloppy teams on the road?

Tom Cable very conservative towards the end. Just happy ending the game.

## Bears @ Buccaneers

Fields didn't see a blitz coming, resulting pretty much in Chicago having to punt.

It's just their first series, but Tampa is making some serious hay through power running. Things aren't looking good at all for Chicago.

Couple drives in and Tampa is still muscling Chicago's front in the ground game.

## Texans @ Cardinals

Murray is not so quick to run the ball now, it seems. Good development from a young quarterback still going through growth spurts.

***

## Chiefs @ Titans

Kansas City pass protection is starting to worry me.

***

## Colts @ 49ers

49ers are running the ball all too easy against the Colts on the opening drive.

Cris Collinsworth brings up an interesting tidbit - the 49ers felt like a mobile quarterback combined with an effective ground game would really work wonders against this Colts defense. It seems like the coaches may have been on to something - misdirection runs have been money against the Colts.

Carson Wentz playing much better. A deep ball to Michael iIttman despite pass interference, followed up shortly by a well-executed play fake to set his tight-end up with a touchdown.
