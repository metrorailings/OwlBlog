## Panthers @ Saints

Panthers are struggling to mount a pass rush on third down against the Saints and their seasoned offensive line.

Why do the Panthers love the three-man pass rush so much? Sure, it opens up zone blitzes, but you're effectively giving an opposing quarterback too much comfort in the pocket so long as the offensive line takes care of business against the three rushers.

Nobody can pick apart zone coverage quite like Drew Brees.

## Buccaneers @ Raiders

Las Vegas trying the fake punt in their own territory. I respect that.

Shaq Barrett truly making his presence known both on pass plays and runs.

Vegas making use of quite a bit of motion before the snap.

Carr losing composure when pressure gets to him.

Kudos to the Raiders offensive line for doing a serviceable job so far in pass protection. Tampa Bay hasn't harassed him as consistently as one would expect.
