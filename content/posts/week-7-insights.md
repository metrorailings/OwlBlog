## Panthers @ Saints

Panthers are struggling to mount a pass rush on third down against the Saints and their seasoned offensive line.

Why do the Panthers love the three-man pass rush so much? Sure, it opens up zone blitzes, but you're effectively giving an opposing quarterback too much comfort in the pocket so long as the offensive line takes care of business against the three rushers.

Nobody can pick apart zone coverage quite like Drew Brees.
