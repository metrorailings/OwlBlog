## Panthers @ Saints

Panthers are struggling to mount a pass rush on third down against the Saints and their seasoned offensive line.

Why do the Panthers love the three-man pass rush so much? Sure, it opens up zone blitzes, but you're effectively giving an opposing quarterback too much comfort in the pocket so long as the offensive line takes care of business against the three rushers.

Nobody can pick apart zone coverage quite like Drew Brees.

## Buccaneers @ Raiders

Las Vegas trying the fake punt in their own territory. I respect that.

Shaq Barrett truly making his presence known both on pass plays and runs.

Vegas making use of quite a bit of motion before the snap.

Carr losing composure when pressure gets to him.

Kudos to the Raiders offensive line for doing a serviceable job so far in pass protection. Tampa Bay hasn't harassed him as consistently as one would expect. Though let's see how well they perform now that their starting right tackle has been sidelined.

I'm starting to realize Brady and Bruce Arians like their players older.

Brady is so comfortable playing in this offense, it's almost beautiful. Gronkowski is starting to look more like the Gronk of old. Deep passes are being aired out with the proper amount of touch. Even aging halfbacks like Leonard Fournette are showing some spunk.

This Raiders offensive line has been masterful in the second half, even with backups. Tampa Bay's pass rush is neutered.

Raiders have keyed in on when the Buccaneers are going to run the ball. The Bucs are so damn predictable with their runs. First downs are almost always rushing downs.

Brady seems to only have deep ball rapport with Chris Godwin and Scottie \~Pippen\~ Miller.

## 49ers @ Patriots

49ers still relying on a whole bunch of misdirection to matriculate the ball downfield.

So many people were saying the Patriots were awful last week due to Newton not having practiced at all for a few weeks. Clearly, that's not the case. In fact, the Patriots soiling themselves today, the Raiders offensive line playing decent enough despite not practicing for two weeks, Tennessee embarrassing Buffalo after their facilities were shut down for two weeks, Buffalo upsetting the Lions years ago even though the Bills spent more time that week shoveling snow then practicing...all this tells me practice IS overrated.

Fans claiming Cam may be playing with an injured shoulder, which would explain his ugly **ugly** performance.

## Seahawks @ Cardinals

Kudos to DK Metcalf for chasing down a 90-yard interception return and giving the defense a (successful) opportunity to prevent the Cardinals from scoring. This Seattle team has heart. That cannot be understated.

Cardinals ran three straight run plays in the red zone in order to cash in on a long interception return. A little bizarre, though Arizona may be of the mindset that a mobile Kyler Murray is their best chance at scoring.

In overtime, I'm not sure what happened with Seattle's offense. It looks to be in complete disarray. Are the Hawks just too tired at this point? Did they even practice?
