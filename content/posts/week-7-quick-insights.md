## Cardinals @ Giants

Chase Edmonds is a beast at halfback. Good vision and acceleration.

Cardinals are actually incorporating a good number of run plays into their offensive playbooks. Some balance is being maintained here, which is telling. It honestly seems Kingsbury's Air Raid experiment may have come to an end here. Even though no team runs more 10 personnel sets than the Cardinals, the fact that Arizona is willfully running the ball on a regular basis violates one of the core tenets of the Air Raid philosophy.
