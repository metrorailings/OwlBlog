## Cardinals @ Giants

Chase Edmonds is a beast at halfback. Good vision and acceleration.

Cardinals are actually incorporating a good number of run plays into their offensive playbooks. Some balance is being maintained here, which is telling. It honestly seems Kingsbury's Air Raid experiment may have come to an end here. Even though no team runs more 10 personnel sets than the Cardinals, the fact that Arizona is willfully running the ball on a regular basis violates one of the core tenets of the Air Raid philosophy.

Defensive line for the Cardinals had their moment here. Eight sacks and multiple quarterback hits, mostly thanks to Daniel Jones insisting on holding the ball longer than he should, even on plays that are not developing as intended.

## Saints @ Bears

Mitchell Trubisky throwing deep is a strategy primed for failure. Trubisky needs to be taught to play smarter and take yardage whenever it avails itself.

What am I saying? MVP Mitch is irredeemable.

Teddy Bridgewater throwing the ball away when plays don't develop as expected. Not ideal, but more quarterbacks need to be doing this instead of playing hero ball.

## Texans @ Colts

Penalties, penalties, penalties....the Texans have been victimized on multiple drives by penalties.

Jacoby Brissett made one clutch throw under duress and almost completed a second one under major pressure from JJ Watt.

The Texans' backup right tackle is simply horrendous. Pressure on a three-man rush is a major red flag.

The Colts defense looks to be pretty disciplined here, given the way a defensive lineman disrupted a tight end from running a leak route out of play action.

Pierre Desir is definitely a solid cornerback for the Colts here, holding DeAndre Hopkins to limited receptions in key moments.

Nobody on this Texans team hit the quarterback more than once outside of JJ Watt. It's concerning, especially for a team that's not that solidly coached in the first place. If this game made one thing clear, it's that Watt is the only elite pass rusher on this squad as of this week.

## Vikings @ Lions

Dalvin Cook is one slippery fuck. And the Vikings knows it.

## Dolphins @ Bills

Slow linebacker coverage from the Dolphins resulted in a big play from a Bills fullback - Patrick DiMarco.

Josh Allen's deep throws are fueled more by prayer than accuracy. Ryan Fitzpatrick has thrown a dime though early, slinging a ball to a receiver in between a cornerback and safety.

Dolphins play a decent amount of man coverage.

Miami's strength on offense seems to be the inside run game, according to their offensive coordinator. Not so coincidentally, the Dolphins have two big runs up the middle in the first quarter alone.

Bad decision-making by Josh Allen costs his team potentially 4 extra points. Still, Allen did put his team in position for the field goal by taking advantage of the Dolphins' poor coverage discipline on a critical third down.

Dolphins seem adamant on running the ball even against eight-man boxes.
