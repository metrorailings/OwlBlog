headline = "Week 7 Supercontest Picks"

+++
My picks last week were _terrible_. Just terrible. Teams I trusted turned in poor performances. Teams I didn't expect to resurge so quickly ended up proving me wrong. A team I did actually expect to resurge ended up sinking to a new low.

I learned quite a bit. For one thing, trust good coaches. Another thing, don't be afraid of going with the underdog, especially those underdogs being given big spreads. Most importantly, never pick the Cowboys again. That last point can't be emphasized enough - the Cowboys are truly a special brand of awful. Both them and the Jets are teams that may need to be banished after the season ends.

### Browns @ Bengals (+3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Browns (7) @ **Steelers** (38)  
Bengals (27) @ **Colts** (31)

#### _Record_

Browns (4-2)  
Bengals (1-4)

#### _Injuries_

On Cleveland's side, the major concern still remains at quarterback. Baker's sore ribs weren't helped at all last week against Pittsburgh.

On Cincinnati's side, the biggest concern is Joe Mixon. If Mixon is absent, Cincinnati may be down its most dynamic playmaker.

#### _History_

The Bengals and Browns have met just five weeks before. That match ended up being a rout in favor of the Browns, though the Bengals fought their way to a backdoor cover.

***

Browns -3

***

**Cleveland covers if**  
Nothing much changes from their first match-up earlier in the year. In that game, Cleveland and their halfback tandem ran wild all over a Cincinnati defense missing key run stoppers along their defensive line.

**Cincinnati covers again if**  
the Bengals do a much better job keeping a lid on Cleveland's rushing attack. A possibility, given the Bengals are now much more intimate with Stefanski's scheme.

### Cowboys @ Washington (PK)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Cardinals** (38) @ Cowboys (10)  
Washington (19) @ **Giants** (20)

#### _Record_

Cowboys (2-4)  
Washington (1-5)

#### _Injuries_

Multiple members of the Cowboys offensive line have been stricken by major injuries. As a result, Dallas may need to reach deep down the depth chart to put give offensive linemen on the field this Sunday.

Washington has a number of injuries worth further evaluation come Friday.

#### _History_

I'm not sure if history is meaningful here given the chaos in the Dallas locker room. In fact, upon further though, I'm not sure if I can assign an identity to this Dallas offense. The only word that perfectly sums up that unit is tragic.

Washington's offense is trying to develop a new identity with Kyle Allen under center, so it's almost impossible to find a meaningful comparable here.

Washington PK

***

**Washington covers if**  
Dallas loses too many battles in the trenches against Washington's defensive front. If the Cowboys can't protect the quarterback or at least open up a few lanes for the tailbacks, it'll be a long day for a Cowboys offense still learning to play football at an adult level.

**Dallas covers if**  
Last year's embarrassing loss becomes a rallying moment for the Cowboys this week.

### Panthers @ Saints (-7.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Bears** (23) @ Panthers (16)  
BYE - Chargers (27) @ **Saints** (30)

#### _Record_

Panthers (3-3)  
Saints (3-2)

#### _Injuries_

Panthers biggest injury concern comes in the secondary, as cornerbacks Donte Jackson and Eli Apple may be ruled out before the game begins.

A couple Saints offensive linemen seem to be nursing injuries. Terron Armstead is the most worrisome of this group. But perhaps more importantly, neither Michael Thomas nor Emmanuel Sanders will be playing in the game.

#### _History_

The last time the New Orleans defense faced an offense largely predicated on short passes, the Saints lost despite being 6-point favorites.

In fact, that same team that upset the Saints faced the Panthers a week prior and barely won. Carolina played well in that game despite the fact that it was installing a new scheme under first-time head coach Matt Rhule.

***

Panthers +7.5

***

**The Panthers cover if**  
Carolina continues making money on its short passing game against the Saints coverage defenders.

**The Saints cover if**  
the defense plays effective man coverage against Carolina's offensive weapons.

### Bears @ Rams (-6)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Bears** (23) @ Panthers (16)  
Rams (16) @ **49ers** (24)

#### _Record_

Bears (5-1)  
Rams (4-2)

#### _Injuries_

The Bears will be missing a few pieces in their secondary.

A few of the Rams skill players are negotiating their way through injuries, but they'll play.

#### _History_

The Rams haven't faced a defense of the Bears caliber this season. The Bears haven't faced a Shanahan style of offense this season.

That being said, the Rams have faced the Bears twice over the past two season. Even though the series was split, the fact remains that Goff struggles  against Chicago and their pass rushers.

***

Bears +6

***

**The Bears cover if**  
the defense harasses Jared Goff to the point where the Rams offense becomes non-functional.

**The Rams cover if**  
the offense can make just enough plays to net over 20 points.

### Steelers @ Titans (-1)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Browns (7) @ **Steelers** (38)  
Texans (36) @ **Titans** (42)

#### _Record_

Steelers (5-0)  
Titans (5-0)

#### _Injuries_

The most notable injury among the Steelers is Mike Hilton. Hilton was critical not only in coverage, but also in blitz packages. Devin Bush being out for the season will likely weaken Pittsburgh's defense against the run.

Titans are surprisingly healthy, though the loss of Taylor Lewan for the season will hurt.

#### _History_

It's hard to draw comparables here. Pittsburgh's defense hasn't faced an elite defense yet this season and Tennessee's offense hasn't faced a dominant pass rush yet this season.

Looking at Pittsburgh's performance last year against elite quarterbacks doesn't inspire much in the way of confidence. Though then again, Pittsburgh's defense was forced to carry the entire team last season, so complimentary football wasn't something the Steelers defense could count on.

***

Steelers +1

***

**The Steelers cover if**  
their pass rushers force Ryan Tannehill into playing ugly.

\**The Titans cover if  
\**Ryan Tannehill can negotiate through the pressure and make plays against a vulnerable Pittsburgh secondary.

### 49ers @ Patriots (-2)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Rams (16) @ **49ers** (24)  
**Broncos** (18) @ Patriots (12)

#### _Record_

49ers (3-3)  
Patriots (2-3)

#### _Injuries_

The 49ers will be down their two starting safeties in addition to all their other injuries. Trent Williams will also be operating at less than full speed.

The Patriots will likely be down a few rotational pieces along the defensive line, though the return of David Andrews is big for an offensive line that hasn't been whole the past couple weeks.

#### _History_

New England faced a base cover-three defense not too long ago up in Seattle. The Patriots offense did well, though so much of their production came towards the end after Seattle ran up the score.

San Francisco hasn't really faced a run-centric offense this season. Arizona is the closest comparable here. Even though the 49ers did well enough stopping runs up the middle, the defense was gashed by rushes on a few occasions. Just going back to last week alone, the defense gave up some significant yardage on runs.

***

Patriots -2

***

**The Patriots cover if**  
the team comes out hot after having a fire lit under their collective arses for their shameful performance last week. Josh McDaniels also needs to turn in a good game plan against a 49ers defense some people criticize as being too vanilla.

**The 49ers cover if**  
New England's offense sputters yet again.

### Buccaneers @ Raiders (+3.5)
