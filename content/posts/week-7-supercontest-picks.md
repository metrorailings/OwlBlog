#### Patriots @ _Jets_ (+9.5)

It's hard going against the Patriots here, but give me a Jets team that found a second life with the return of Sam Darnold last week. It also helps that C.J. Mosley _should_ be coming back into the fold here after spending the last several weeks sidelined with injury.

Besides, it helps that New York's coaches should be better prepared in this match, having faced off against New England just a few weeks ago. On the flip side, the Patriots will have a harder time preparing for a Jets team with a new signal caller that hasn't played much this year.

#### Vikings @ _Lions_ (+1)

Kirk Cousins has been having a few good weeks, but I expect his run to end against a Lions team that can hold up respectably against a good passing game. In fact, Detroit has become one of the best overall teams in the league this year, with little fanfare. The Lions' defensive backs should be able to limit Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielan in man coverage. Likewise, Stafford's tendency to throw beyond the sticks should fare well against a Vikings defensive backfield that's lost some of its edge this year.
