headline = "Week 8 Circa Picks"

+++
An all-right record last week, as I nailed three games and lost pretty dismally on the other two. Why did I ever take the Jets? Seriously...I think I gambled a little too hard on Vegas knowing more than the public for that game. I feel so damn silly taking a team coached by a chump like Robert Saleh. Even if Zach Wilson was healthy for the whole game, New York's defense would have still been hosed for over 40 points.

Also, the Eagles taught me a rough lesson - **never** bank on a road team so shamelessly given to mistakes and sloppy play. It's bad enough when teams poke out their own eyes on their home turf, but self-inflicted wounds are all the more exacerbated on the road, especially against teams with quality quarterbacks.

So with that said, let's get to Week 8. This week, the focus will be on trying to pick teams with competent quarterbacks. Bad teams will only be picked if they're taking points against other bad teams - as simple as that.

Lions @ **Rams**  
Texans @ **Cardinals**

#### _Key Injuries_

Rams have been on a wicked healthy streak as of late. That streak will likely continue this week.

Christian Kirksey has a fractured thumb, so that might sideline him for this game, unless the organization finds a way to have him play with some sort of splint.

#### _History_

Houston's offense, led by Davis Mills, has only mustered three drives into the red zone over the past three weeks. Only one of those drives ended in a touchdown. The Texans actually have more drives ending in failed fourth downs than red zone trips.

**Los Angeles covers if**  
the Houston offense sputters and crashes yet again in hilarious fashion.

**Houston covers if**  
the Texans sacrifice enough virgins to convince the gods to bless them with a couple touchdowns. Minutely possible should a bunch of Ram players be battling hangovers on game day.
