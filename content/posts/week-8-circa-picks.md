headline = "Week 8 Circa Picks"

+++
An all-right record last week, as I nailed three games and lost pretty dismally on the other two. Why did I ever take the Jets? Seriously...I think I gambled a little too hard on Vegas knowing more than the public for that game. I feel so damn silly taking a team coached by a chump like Robert Saleh. Even if Zach Wilson was healthy for the whole game, New York's defense would have still been hosed for over 40 points.

Also, the Eagles taught me a rough lesson - **never** bank on a road team so shamelessly given to mistakes and sloppy play. It's bad enough when teams poke out their own eyes on their home turf, but self-inflicted wounds are all the more exacerbated on the road, especially against teams with quality quarterbacks.

So with that said, let's get to Week 8. This week, the focus will be on trying to pick teams with competent quarterbacks. Bad teams will only be picked if they're taking points against other bad teams - as simple as that.

### Rams @ Texans (+14.5)

#### _Latest Results_

Lions @ **Rams**  
Texans @ **Cardinals**

#### _Key Injuries_

Rams have been on a wicked healthy streak as of late. That streak will likely continue this week.

Christian Kirksey has a fractured thumb, so that might sideline him for this game, unless the organization finds a way to have him play with some sort of splint. More importantly, Tyrod Taylor is returning to practice this week, so it's remotely possible the Texans could have the services of their starting quarterback just in time for this game.

#### _History_

Houston's offense, led by Davis Mills, has only mustered three drives into the red zone over the past three weeks. Only one of those drives ended in a touchdown. The Texans actually have more drives ending in failed fourth downs than red zone trips.

Just smashing weather

Rams -14.5

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Davis Mills the Houston offense sputters and crashes yet again in hilarious fashion.

**Houston covers if**  
the Texans sacrifice enough virgins to convince the gods to bless them with a couple touchdowns. Minutely possible should a bunch of Ram players be battling hangovers on game day  
\- OR -  
Tyrod Taylor returns in dramatic fashion and better than before, reinvigorating an offense that's been doing nothing but choking on its own spit.

### Eagles @ Lions (+3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Eagles @ **Raiders**  
Lions @ **Rams**

#### _Key Injuries_

The Eagles best offensive player in Miles Sanders is expected to miss a week, at least. On top of that, a whole bunch of key starters on both sides of the ball are dealing with injuries, some more than others. If Javon Hargrave isn't fully healthy, Philadelphia loses quite a bit of teeth along that defensive front.

Detroit's healthy, for the most part.

#### _History_

No recent history, not that it matters much. Both teams have inaugurated new coaches and quarterbacks this year anyway.

One key piece of information worth noting here - the Eagles defense have been lovingly faithful to coverage schemes keeping two safeties deep. As a result, the defense has not only been predictable, but in theory, it should be susceptible to offenses predicated on scheduled production. So long as offenses can constantly matriculate the ball in dribs and drabs, points can be scored against this Philadelphia defense, especially if their pass rush struggles to find consistent success.

#### _Weather_

Dome game

Lions +3.5

***

**Detroit covers if**  
their offense can generate positive value on the vast majority of its plays. Their offensive line needs to keep Goff protected on those plays that take time to develop.

**Philadelphia covers if**  
their defensive front can actually step up and harass Jared Goff into playing ugly. A few forced turnovers from Goff would go a long way for these Eagles  
\- OR -  
Detroit finds ways to embarrass itself once again in their accidental quest for a winless season.

### Cowboys @ Vikings (-2.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Vikings - BYE  
Cowboys - BYE

#### _Key Injuries_

Dak tweaked his ankle in the overtime win against the Patriots. Even though he's been reseting now for more than a week, the ankle remains an issue, signifying something concerning. Prescott may be limited come game time.

No major injuries to the Minnesota Vikings as of yet.

#### _History_

Last year, the Vikings and the Cowboys faced off against one another in Minnesota, though Dak Prescott wasn't the starting quarterback for the time. Also, the defense wasn't as well-coached at the time, what with Mike Nolan being the coordinator at the time. Dallas pulled out the win despite Kirk Cousins having a damn good game. I need to assess why, but I suspect Dallas found offensive success primarily by running the ball through Ezekiel Elliott.

UPDATE: Watching the game now, I can clearly see Minnesota's offensive line getting housed by Dallas' front seven. In fact, Dallas is winning the trench battles on both sides of the ball, as evidenced by Ezekiel Elliott gaining more yards on his carries than Dalvin Cook. Then again, Minnesota is down their best pass rusher as well as a starting guard, so it's not a completely fair comparison.

**Dallas covers if**  
their offense and defensive lines can win a clear majority of battles against their Viking counterparts. The offensive line especially needs to hold strong, as Dak is dealing with a lingering ankle issue.

**Minnesota covers if**  
the primetime spotlight and the roars of thousands of fans cheering in their support gives these Vikings the extra juice necessary to play in a manic state against an opponent that's objectively better than them  
\- OR -  
Dak Prescott is unable to play, leaving Cooper Rush in charge of the offense.

### Panthers @ Falcons (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Panthers @ **Giants  
Falcons** @ Dolphins

#### _Key Injuries_

Panthers lose another valuable piece in the secondary in safety Justin Burris, but more importantly, another starting guard was lost to injured reserve. Carolina's situation there was precarious enough as is, but things just look worse now that a tenuous point along that line has been weakened even further.

Atlanta should be reasonably healthy.

#### _History_

Recent games between these two won't matter much here given Atlanta overhauled its coaching regime this offseason. That being said, it's still worth mentioning that these two teams split games last year, with Atlanta winning the more recent contest. One can make the argument that the Falcons loss to Carolina carries no relevance here, as the team still had the noose of Dan Quinn wound tightly around its neck.

#### _Weather_

Dome game

Falcons -3

***

**Atlanta covers if**  
Matt Ryan can stitch together three scoring drives using Kyle Pitts, Hayden Hurst, Cordarrelle Patterson, and Calvin Ridley. It won't be easy matriculating the football against this beastly Panther defensive front, but Atlanta's defense will need to do whatever it can to snuff out Carolina's drives so as to maximize opportunities for their offense.

**Carolina covers if**  
their defense kills almost every single drive the Falcons begin on offense. Certainly possible given Atlanta's offensive line can barely hold up against mediocre competition as is. The Panthers need to prevent Matty Ice from developing any sort of rhythm here. Keeping Atlanta to the single digits here is probably the key to a Carolina victory here.

### Patriots @ Chargers (-6)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Jets @ **Patriots**  
Chargers - BYE

#### _Key Injuries_

Austin Ekeler would be a major loss for the Chargers if his hip keeps him out of action this Sunday. The Patriot linebackers are so terribly mismatched against a shifty tailback of his caliber.

The Patriots will be missing the presence of one of their star cornerbacks for the rest of this season. Jonathan Jones will be undergoing season-ending surgery. Other than him, New England seems mostly healthy, if a bit banged up.

#### _History_

The Chargers were absolutely demolished by Bill Belichick's Patriots last year. It's not even funny - the Chargers were completely shut out from a New England team starting Cam Newton at quarterback.

Watching the game right now.....I see Stephon Gilmore and Jonathan Jones making plays in the secondary, the Patriot defensive line having its way with the Chargers offensive line, Cam Newton and his tailbacks making some hay through misdirection, the Chargers committing multiple special teams miscues...so many things are going wrong for Los Angeles. New England can't count on all these things happening again, that's for sure - for one thing, the Patriots offense no longer revolves around an exotic rushing package leveraging the mobility of their starting quarterback.

#### _Weather_

It's a dome affair.

Patriots +6

**New England covers if**  
Damien Harris and the rest of the offense establish the ground game that's been rip-roaringly productive the past couple weeks  
\- AND -  
their defensive coaches continue to find ways to attack the loose threads in the Chargers' pass protection schemes.

**Los Angeles covers if**  
the new coaches in charge of the offense devise fresh new protection strategies to safeguard their quarterback from New England's pass rush  
\- OR -  
Justin Herbert and the rest of the offense rack up the yards against a middling New England defense.

### Jaguars @ Seahawks (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Jaguars - BYE  
**Saints** @ Seahawks (MNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

Jaguars can no longer count on the services of DJ Chark for the rest of the season. Without Chark, Jacksonville is down a key deep threat.

Seattle's more concerning though. DK Metcalf and Alex Collins have yet to practice this week, putting their status in doubt.

#### _History_

No recent history between these two given both belong to different conferences.

#### _Weather_

Moderately cool

***

Seahawks -3

***

**Seattle covers if**  
Geno Smith plays respectably after spending the last two weeks facing off against two of the NFL's better defenses. Jacksonville's defense is the type of defense Smith should readily exploit.

**Jacksonville covers if**  
their ground game sustains drives on offense consistently against a Seattle defensive unit prone to performance lapses  
\- AND -  
their defense can actually record a few stops against a second-string quarterback.

### Giants @ Chiefs (-10)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Panthers @ **Giants**  
Chiefs @ **Titans**

#### _Key Injuries_

Clyde Edwards-Helaire being on injured reserve as really hurt the Chiefs rushing attack. That being said, it's a reality they've been dealing with now for a couple weeks, so perhaps Reid will find ways to adjust. Aside from that, Kansas is healthy.

I can't say the same about the Giants though. Kenny Golladay and Saquon Barkley are out. The good news is that Sterling Shepard and Kadarius Toney have a real chance to play. Having Toney back in tandem with Shepard can really open up a new dimension of this offense, so long as the Clapper puts them both to good use.

#### _History_

No history worth looking at between these two. The Giants defense has been a pointed area of concern this season, especially against opposing rushers. That being said, last week saw a dramatic improvement from that gang, though it remains to be seen whether the Giants can sustain that level of play against better competition.

It's almost certain the Giants will be in two-deep safety looks for most of the game, as the Chiefs have had a notoriously difficult time handling those coverage shells. Unless Mahomes changes his style of play, I suspect the Chiefs will continue to struggle against those coverages.

#### _Weather_

Cold with a chance of light rain

***

Giants +10

***

**New York covers if**  
Mahomes and the Chiefs offense continue struggling against coverage shells situating multiple safeties deep in the backfield. It's these types of coverages that mitigates Tyreek Hill's influence on the game. And without Hill and a fully healthy Kelce, Kansas is a paper tiger.

**Kansas covers if**  
Mahomes finally adjusts his style of play and focuses more on short and intermediate. It's a strategy that should work wonders against a Giants defense known for leaving the middle of the field soft  
\- AND -  
their defense actually steps up for once and stall out the Giants offense on at least four drives.
