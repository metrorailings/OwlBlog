headline = "Week 8 Circa Picks"

+++
An all-right record last week, as I nailed three games and lost pretty dismally on the other two. Why did I ever take the Jets? Seriously...I think I gambled a little too hard on Vegas knowing more than the public for that game. I feel so damn silly taking a team coached by a chump like Robert Saleh. Even if Zach Wilson was healthy for the whole game, New York's defense would have still been hosed for over 40 points.

Also, the Eagles taught me a rough lesson - **never** bank on a road team so shamelessly given to mistakes and sloppy play. It's bad enough when teams poke out their own eyes on their home turf, but self-inflicted wounds are all the more exacerbated on the road, especially against teams with quality quarterbacks.

So with that said, let's get to Week 8. This week, the focus will be on trying to pick teams with competent quarterbacks. Bad teams will only be picked if they're taking points against other bad teams - as simple as that.

Lions @ **Rams**  
Texans @ **Cardinals**

#### _Key Injuries_

Rams have been on a wicked healthy streak as of late. That streak will likely continue this week.

Christian Kirksey has a fractured thumb, so that might sideline him for this game, unless the organization finds a way to have him play with some sort of splint. More importantly, Tyrod Taylor is returning to practice this week, so it's remotely possible the Texans could have the services of their starting quarterback just in time for this game.

#### _History_

Houston's offense, led by Davis Mills, has only mustered three drives into the red zone over the past three weeks. Only one of those drives ended in a touchdown. The Texans actually have more drives ending in failed fourth downs than red zone trips.

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Davis Mills the Houston offense sputters and crashes yet again in hilarious fashion.

**Houston covers if**  
the Texans sacrifice enough virgins to convince the gods to bless them with a couple touchdowns. Minutely possible should a bunch of Ram players be battling hangovers on game day  
\- OR -  
Tyrod Taylor returns in dramatic fashion and better than before, reinvigorating an offense that's been doing nothing but choking on its own spit.

### Eagles @ Lions (+3.5)

Eagles @ **Raiders**  
Lions @ **Rams**

#### _Key Injuries_

The Eagles best offensive player in Miles Sanders is expected to miss a week, at least. On top of that, a whole bunch of key starters on both sides of the ball are dealing with injuries, some more than others. If Javon Hargrave isn't fully healthy, Philadelphia loses quite a bit of teeth along that defensive front.

Detroit's healthy, for the most part.

#### _History_

No recent history, not that it matters much. Both teams have inaugurated new coaches and quarterbacks this year anyway.

One key piece of information worth noting here - the Eagles defense have been lovingly faithful to coverage schemes keeping two safeties deep. As a result, the defense has not only been predictable, but in theory, it should be susceptible to offenses predicated on scheduled production. So long as offenses can constantly matriculate the ball in dribs and drabs, points can be scored against this Philadelphia defense, especially if their pass rush struggles to find consistent success.

Lions +3.5

**Detroit covers if**  
their offense can generate positive value on the vast majority of its plays. Their offensive line needs to keep Goff protected on those plays that take time to develop.

**Philadelphia covers if**  
their defensive front can actually step up and harass Jared Goff into playing ugly. A few forced turnovers from Goff would go a long way for these Eagles  
\- OR -  
Detroit finds ways to embarrass itself once again in their accidental quest for a winless season.

### Cowboys @ Vikings (+2.5)

#### _Latest Results_

Vikings - BYE  
Cowboys - BYE

#### _Key Injuries_

Dak tweaked his ankle in the overtime win against the Patriots. Even though he's been reseting now for more than a week, the ankle remains an issue, signifying something concerning. Prescott may be limited come game time.

No major injuries to the Minnesota Vikings as of yet.

#### _History_

Last year, the Vikings and the Cowboys faced off against one another in Texas, though Dak Prescott wasn't the starting quarterback for the time. Also, the defense wasn't as well-coached at the time, what with Mike Nolan being the coordinator at the time. Dallas pulled out the win despite Kirk Cousins having a damn good game. I need to assess why, but I suspect Dallas found offensive success primarily by running the ball through Ezekiel Elliott.
