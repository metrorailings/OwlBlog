headline = "Week 8 Circa Picks"

+++
An all-right record last week, as I nailed three games and lost pretty dismally on the other two. Why did I ever take the Jets? Seriously...I think I gambled a little too hard on Vegas knowing more than the public for that game. I feel so damn silly taking a team coached by a chump like Robert Saleh. Even if Zach Wilson was healthy for the whole game, New York's defense would have still been hosed for over 40 points.

Also, the Eagles taught me a rough lesson - **never** bank on a road team so shamelessly given to mistakes and sloppy play. It's bad enough when teams poke out their own eyes on their home turf, but self-inflicted wounds are all the more exacerbated on the road, especially against teams with quality quarterbacks.

So with that said, let's get to Week 8. This week, the focus will be on trying to pick teams with competent quarterbacks. Bad teams will only be picked if they're taking points against other bad teams - as simple as that.

#### _Latest Results_

**Packers** @ Bears  
**Buccaneers** @ Eagles (TNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

Robert Quinn is an important player to keep an eye on, given his role on Chicago's defense. He'll need to pass COVID protocol before he can travel with his brothers-in-arms over to Tampa. Without him, the Bears defense suffers a massive hit to its defense at the most inopportune time.

Tampa Bay remains banged up. Rob Gronkowski, Jason Pierre-Paul, Antonio Brown, and Lavante David haven't been practicing, putting their chances of playing this weekend in jeopardy. A few of these players should be able to play, though it remains uncertain exactly who. Gronk and JPP would be the most impactful names coming off injury.

#### _History_

Tampa and Chicago met last year in a primetime moment on Soldier Field. The Bears eked out a win against a Buccaneer team still cutting its teeth in the Brady era. From what I remember, Brady's offensive linemen failed him on multiple occasions. On top of that, Tampa was missing so many of its weapons. The only reason the game remained competitive was because Nick Foles kept missing open throws to his receivers.

#### _Weather_

Seasonably hot and gently humid

Buccaneers -12.5

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
Brady and the offense aren't caught slacking against a clearly inferior team. Tampa will be given enough opportunities on offense to score points, it's just a matter of whether the will is there to run up the score  
\- OR -  
The Buccaneers enter the game with all their key injured players active.

**Chicago covers if**  
their offense can somehow score at least 17 points against Tampa's defense. Certainly possible if the Buccaneers end up stalling too much against Chicago's top-tier defense. Robert Quinn coming back would be an incredibly positive development for the Bears.
