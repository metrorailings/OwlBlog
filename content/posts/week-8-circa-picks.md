+++
An all-right record last week, as I nailed three games and lost pretty dismally on the other two. Why did I ever take the Jets? Seriously...I think I gambled a little too hard on Vegas knowing more than the public for that game. I feel so damn silly taking a team coached by a chump like Robert Saleh. Even if Zach Wilson was healthy for the whole game, New York's defense would have still been hosed for over 40 points.

Also, the Eagles taught me a rough lesson - **never** bank on a road team so shamelessly given to mistakes and sloppy play. It's bad enough when teams poke out their own eyes on their home turf, but self-inflicted wounds are all the more exacerbated on the road, especially against teams with quality quarterbacks.

So with that said, let's get to Week 8. This week, the focus will be on trying to pick teams with competent quarterbacks. Bad teams will only be picked if they're taking points against other bad teams - as simple as that.
