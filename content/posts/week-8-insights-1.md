## Packers @ Cardinals

Packers running the ball with some authority. Impressive. Cardinals have serious issues defensing the run. It seems Green Bay racked up more rushing yardage after contact than before contact.

Green Bay's defensive line is just wrecking Arizona's offensive line. Only when Arizona started speeding up the tempo did the Packers end up surrendering serious yardage. 

Aaron Rodgers having a hard time out there without his usual set of receivers. Clearly frustrated.
