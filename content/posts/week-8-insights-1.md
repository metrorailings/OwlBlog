## Packers @ Cardinals

Packers running the ball with some authority. Impressive. Cardinals have serious issues defensing the run. It seems Green Bay racked up more rushing yardage after contact than before contact.

Green Bay's defensive line is just wrecking Arizona's offensive line. Only when Arizona started speeding up the tempo did the Packers end up surrendering serious yardage.

Aaron Rodgers having a hard time out there without his usual set of receivers. Clearly frustrated. It took three whole quarters for the man to break 100 yards passing.

Jordan Hicks out here making plays for the Cards.

Green Bay's use of rub/pick routes is damn near masterful.

Arizona's cornerbacks have been really aggressive. They're operating more off instinct than cunning.

Did the Packers defensive front just lose all its juice at the end of the fourth quarter? Kyler Murray is mounting a wicked comeback here.

Chase Edmonds is a real gamer for this Cardinals offense.

AJ Green, on the other hand....just awful ignorance on his part. He was blocking on a pass play. Did he think the ball was going to run?

## Patriots @ Chargers

Patriots can run the ball fairly effective, but it seems Josh McDaniels is intentionally dialing back the ground game in favor of passing with Mac Jones. It makes sense, as the Chargers are really plumbing the depths of their roster to fill out the secondary. But Mac Jones isn't playing well at all.

What's helping the Patriots out though is that the Chargers offense is playing just as sloppy. Herbert's inaccurate, some of his receivers aren't making plays...I wonder if this is simply hangover from the bye week. I'd hope so, because if not, the implication then is that this Charger passing offense melts into shit once you take Mike Williams out of the picture.

## Buccaneers @ Saints

I need to watch this game, but I think New Orleans understands Brady and the Bucs better than any other team in the league. Tampa Bay is losing against a New Orleans team without either of its two starting quarterbacks and without any real weapons on offense.

I wonder if New Orleans is so successful against Tampa because they understand the way Brady sets his protections.

## Cowboys @ Vikings

Trayvon Diggs may be a liability in coverage. His nose for the ball is amazing, but his overall performance as a cornerback may be lacking.

Creative offensive plays coming from the Cowboys here. Kellen Moore is doing a great job incorporating concepts like the wishbone to keep the ground game churning and to set up easier passes for Cooper Rush.

It baffles me that more people are not double-covering CeeDee Lamb. Easily the most explosive weapon for the Cowboys.

This Cowboys offensive line is fantastic at run-blocking. It's really a sight to behold. Minnesota is starting to key in on the ground game more, though.

Vikings cannot run the ball well at all. I'm not sure if the Cowboys are just so good against the run or if Dalvin Cook is hurt. It looks like he doesn't have the same pop as somebody of his caliber should have.
