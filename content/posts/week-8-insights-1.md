## Packers @ Cardinals

Packers running the ball with some authority. Impressive. Cardinals have serious issues defensing the run. It seems Green Bay racked up more rushing yardage after contact than before contact.

Green Bay's defensive line is just wrecking Arizona's offensive line. Only when Arizona started speeding up the tempo did the Packers end up surrendering serious yardage. 

Aaron Rodgers having a hard time out there without his usual set of receivers. Clearly frustrated. It took three whole quarters for the man to break 100 yards passing.

Jordan Hicks out here making plays for the Cards.

Green Bay's use of rub/pick routes is damn near masterful.

Arizona's cornerbacks have been really aggressive. They're operating more off instinct than cunning.

Did the Packers defensive front just lose all its juice at the end of the fourth quarter? Kyler Murray is mounting a wicked comeback here.

Chase Edmonds is a real gamer for this Cardinals offense.

AJ Green, on the other hand....just awful ignorance on his part. He was blocking on a pass play. Did he think the ball was going to run?
