## Packers @ Cardinals

Packers running the ball with some authority. Impressive. Cardinals have serious issues defensing the run. It seems Green Bay racked up more rushing yardage after contact than before contact.

Green Bay's defensive line is just wrecking Arizona's offensive line. Only when Arizona started speeding up the tempo did the Packers end up surrendering serious yardage.

Aaron Rodgers having a hard time out there without his usual set of receivers. Clearly frustrated. It took three whole quarters for the man to break 100 yards passing.

Jordan Hicks out here making plays for the Cards.

Green Bay's use of rub/pick routes is damn near masterful.

Arizona's cornerbacks have been really aggressive. They're operating more off instinct than cunning.

Did the Packers defensive front just lose all its juice at the end of the fourth quarter? Kyler Murray is mounting a wicked comeback here.

Chase Edmonds is a real gamer for this Cardinals offense.

AJ Green, on the other hand....just awful ignorance on his part. He was blocking on a pass play. Did he think the ball was going to run?

## Patriots @ Chargers

Patriots can run the ball fairly effective, but it seems Josh McDaniels is intentionally dialing back the ground game in favor of passing with Mac Jones. It makes sense, as the Chargers are really plumbing the depths of their roster to fill out the secondary. But Mac Jones isn't playing well at all.

What's helping the Patriots out though is that the Chargers offense is playing just as sloppy. Herbert's inaccurate, some of his receivers aren't making plays...I wonder if this is simply hangover from the bye week. I'd hope so, because if not, the implication then is that this Charger passing offense melts into shit once you take Mike Williams out of the picture.

## Buccaneers @ Saints

I need to watch this game, but I think New Orleans understands Brady and the Bucs better than any other team in the league. Tampa Bay is losing against a New Orleans team without either of its two starting quarterbacks and without any real weapons on offense.

I wonder if New Orleans is so successful against Tampa because they understand the way Brady sets his protections.

## Cowboys @ Vikings

Trayvon Diggs may be a liability in coverage. His nose for the ball is amazing, but his overall performance as a cornerback may be lacking.

Creative offensive plays coming from the Cowboys here. Kellen Moore is doing a great job incorporating concepts like the wishbone to keep the ground game churning and to set up easier passes for Cooper Rush.

It baffles me that more people are not double-covering CeeDee Lamb. Easily the most explosive weapon for the Cowboys.

This Cowboys offensive line is fantastic at run-blocking. It's really a sight to behold. Minnesota is starting to key in on the ground game more, though.

Vikings cannot run the ball well at all. I'm not sure if the Cowboys are just so good against the run or if Dalvin Cook is hurt. It looks like he doesn't have the same pop as somebody of his caliber should have.

Cousins is disappointing me with his lack of touch and his willingness to throw the ball short of the sticks on third down. Although perhaps that's an indictment on Klint Kubiak not calling screen passes against a defense intentionally leaving the flat exposed on third downs.

Micah Parsons is a tour-de-force. And kudos to Dan Quinn for opting to play more man coverage defense given his personnel. A cover-three system doesn't really work in today's NFL without sufficient talent.

My watching tape was on point here. I took the Vikings here as I'd figure Cooper Rush is good for one or two critical mistakes (especially on enemy territory). If Minnesota does win this, that'll be the reason they win. But otherwise, the Cowboys have thoroughly dominated Minnesota in literally every aspect. My tape analysis of their match last year affirmed this too - Dallas held wrist control the entire match, especially in the trenches.

The Vikings interior offensive line is just so pathetic on pass protection. Dallas (or more specifically Dan Quinn) smartly shifted to a five-man defensive front, isolating each of the offensive linemen. The guards and center have been letting up serious pressure and holding disgustingly just to avoid getting their quarterback killed.

Do the Vikings not have a dropback passing game or a hurry-up package here? If not, it highlights a major deficiency on this offense - it's an offense living and dying by the efficacy of the bootleg.

## Steelers @ Browns

As sort of expected, this is a defensive line battle. Whichever defensive line can assert their will more is going to win.

Najee Harris has been decently productive against this Cleveland defense. The man has some fire in him.

Interesting to see the Steelers incorporate read-option plays into their offensive identity.

Cleveland's pass coverage just isn't fully developed yet. Coverage lapses are common. Not to mention the cornerbacks playing soft don't help against people like Diontae Johnson.

The Browns and Steelers are far more evenly matched than one would think. Baker is about as hopeless as Ben Roethlisberger, though the former still has some power in his throws.

## 49ers @ Bears

The 49ers defensive front is doing a good job rushing the passer, but Justin Fields is finding quick outlets all too easily in receivers settling in the middle flat.

Observing Chicago incorporate more max protect concepts in their offensive playbook is good to see. Justin Fields needs some help if he is to grow.

Khalil Herbert is such a beast. It's entertaining watching the man shift left and right as he runs past defenders. You know, if Nagy can bring over the Greg Roman style of offense and pair Herbert with Fields mobility, you'd have something special there.

Chicago's defense is playing very well. Just sound technique and game-planning. Sean Desai has a well-trained unit here. Still....the 49ers nailing a huge play on a 3rd and 20 jump-started that offense. It's an explosive play that sometimes can't be helped. Kudos to the 49ers and their speedy receivers for sparking life back into the offense.

49ers running with some passion.

## Giants @ Chiefs

Daniel Jones staring at his receiver leads to an interception. Football 101, Danny....don't be staring at receivers.

Finally a deep bomb to John Ross seems to have opened this offense up. Good to see Jones throw it against tight coverage. Chiefs failed to defend the pass as expected.

Just sloppy execution and lack of organization by the Giants offense killing a promising drive.

***

## Jaguars @ Seahawks

How is it that the Jaguars are getting gashed on the ground despite having seven men in the box?

***

## Panthers @ Falcons

Panthers air game seems to consist of nothing more but screens and deliberate short passes.

Kudos to the Carolina defense for double-covering Kyle Pitts.

Atlanta's offense has more spunk than I originally thought. Cordarrelle Patterson is reinvigorating this unit with his passion.

Carolina made some hay in the second half by committing wholeheartedly to the ground game, invoking all sorts of rushing and pseudo-rushing concepts to throw off the Atlanta defense. Inside zone rushes, C-gap rushes, quarterback keepers, bootlegs, fullback power runs, etc. Atlanta was almost helpless. The few passes they actually called were successful, in part due to the Falcons playing so soft in coverage.
