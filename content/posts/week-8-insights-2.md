## Patriots @ Jets

So this might be the end of Mac Jones.

The Jets defense needs to be given serious credit here for being so stout despite the Patriots dominating time of possession.

The Patriots are getting bailed out by the referees. A shame too. A roughing the passer call that wiped out a pick-six. Earlier, another unnecessary roughness call against a mobile Mac Jones gave the Patriots some unnecessary life on a drive.

I have to give credit to New England, adjusting in the second half offensively by committing to shorter, quicker passes. Less stress also put on Mac Jones shoulders, considering he doesn't have to wait for routes to develop.

Meanwhile, the Jets seem to have trusted Zack Wilson to carry the team here. BIG mistake. Wilson's so bad that he threw an interception on a throwaway.

As I thought, this was a game dictated by mistakes and sloppy moments. Good thing I stayed away from this one. Both starting quarterbacks have been just depressing.
