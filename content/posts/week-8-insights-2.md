## Patriots @ Jets

So this might be the end of Mac Jones.

The Jets defense needs to be given serious credit here for being so stout despite the Patriots dominating time of possession.

The Patriots are getting bailed out by the referees. A shame too. A roughing the passer call that wiped out a pick-six. Earlier, another unnecessary roughness call against a mobile Mac Jones gave the Patriots some unnecessary life on a drive.
