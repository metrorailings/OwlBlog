## Falcons @ Panthers

Real talk - I think Teddy Bridgewater was still concussed during the Panthers last gasp drive. He wasn't right. He was taking too long to snap the ball and he was taking way too much time throwing the ball. It's like his processing time slowed incredibly after that brutal hit to his head.

The Falcons winning this game doesn't mean much. Their red zone offense was just disgustingly inept. The offensive line still has issues. Not to mention the dice rolls were in their favor quite a bit tonight.

## Titans @ Bengals

Cincinnati is just hilarious bad against the run.

Joe Burrow is the real thing. Thanks to Tennessee's anemic pass rush, he's playing like an all-pro.

***

## Patriots @ Bills

Patriots are a bit undermanned in the box, maybe cause of injury or lack of depth?

***

## Steelers @ Ravens

Odd to see Ravens run the ball with some serious gusto against these Steelers. Not only is rookie tailback Dobbins impressive with his ability to break tackles and create yards after contact, but the outside zone blocking and Lamar's option runs have been money in the ground game. Kudos to Baltimore for doing what other teams couldn't against Pittsburgh.

Hollywood Brown is not happy about his lack of touches.

## Saints @ Bears

Bears running the ball with more force, it seems.

Foles was money on a deep throw to Darnell Mooney. Once again, it's the dig routes that the Saints cannot cover because their cornerbacks always insist on outside leverage. And as I write this, Foles throws another big pass to Allen Robinson.

Brees got no power on his throws.

Finally, it seems like the Bears are committing more to releasing the ball quicker. But the Time to Throw statistic this week will indicate whether the Bears are truly intent on getting rid of the ball quicker.

Never mind, I take that back, this Bears offense still sucks dick like a $20 crack whore.

## Colts @ Lions

Romeo Okwara something special.

Colts mixing up coverages on defense. Single-high, cover-two, cover-four...

Detroit doing very well against the run so far.

Rivers may be smart, but his throws lack serious power and ambition. Thankfully, Reich has been doing well incorporating some pretty creative concepts into the playbook to help the Colts move the ball.

Indy started seeing success in their ground game once they settled into their zone running.

Love seeing Indy's offensive linemen sticking up for their quarterback.

Good use of tempo by the Colts offense. Led to a touchdown where the Lions were caught completely off guard.

Denico Autry showing up big on one drive, singlehandedly killing a Lions drive by forcing a holding call and then following up with a sack.

Naheem Hynes turning into an all-around weapon for the Colts.

Detroit's offensive line has serious issues, especially in pass protection.

## Vikings @ Packers

Packers running their base offense against the Vikings - zone runs, bootlegs, jet motions...

Green Bay is just horrendous against the run, even when they line up in a traditional 3-4 defensive alignment.

On a 3rd quarter drive, it was more the Vikings passing attack than it was Dalvin Cook that ultimately led to a touchdown.

It's becoming clear to me that Green Bay wasn't as prepared in this game as the Vikings, likely in anticipation for their upcoming match against a 49er team that embarrassed them twice last year.

A beautifully-timed screen pass on a 3rd-and-long from the Vikings went all the way to the end zone, as the Packers dropped most of their defense way past the sticks, anticipating Kirk Cousins would throw the ball.
