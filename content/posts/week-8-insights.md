## Falcons @ Panthers

Real talk - I think Teddy Bridgewater was still concussed during the Panthers last gasp drive. He wasn't right. He was taking too long to snap the ball and he was taking way too much time throwing the ball. It's like his processing time slowed incredibly after that brutal hit to his head.

The Falcons winning this game doesn't mean much. Their red zone offense was just disgustingly inept. The offensive line still has issues. Not to mention the dice rolls were in their favor quite a bit tonight.
