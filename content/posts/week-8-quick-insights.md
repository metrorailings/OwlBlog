## Giants @ Lions

Why does Pat Shurmur run on 2nd and long? Why is this a thing in the NFL?

Giants run defense once again choking up yardage to opposing rushers.

Jones is rough. The kid is still holding on to balls recklessly. And Shurmur telegraphing run plays doesn't help the situation.

Giants offensive playbook seems to favor high-low routes where a receiver runs a slant route to the outside while the inside receiver crosses underneath to the flat. Daniel Jones seems to prefer throwing to the deeper receiver, even in tight coverage.

Darius Slayton may be a beast in the making for the Giants. Finally, something worthy of taking that Hakeem Nicks role.

## Eagles @ Bills

Josh Allen's ability to run is really tasking these coverage defenders patrolling the flat. The threat of Josh Allen scrambling has these defenders dropping off their assignments.

***

## Browns @ Patriots

Greedy Williams and Denzel Ward playing well in their return.

Once again, the Browns shooting themselves in the foot with penalties.

New England's passing offense is definitely suspect. It seems the team only found consistent success through their screen game and improvisational plays. If it wasn't for the defense, the game would have been competitive well into the fourth quarter.

***

## Packers @ Chiefs

More blitzing by the Chiefs linebackers and safeties leading to positive results.

Lots of window dressing before the snap serving the Chiefs well, confusing this Packers defense. It also helps that the Packers are regularly overcompensating in their coverage on Tyreek Hill.

The Chiefs' linebackers are liabilities in coverage, particularly in 5-wide situations.

The creative plays that were sustaining the Chiefs early in the game have largely disappeared. Reid only drew up so many of them, apparently. Late game magic for the Chiefs largely boils down to the quarterback's ability to create plays.

Rodgers has taken over the offensive play-calling in closing out the game, which indicates to me that LaFleur is reluctantly (but correctly) allowing his quarterback to call the shots when need be.

## Chargers @ Bears

Soldier Field has some slippery turf. Good coaches like Sean Payton are well aware of this and advise their players to wear better cleats. Bad coaches like Anthony Lynn aren't quite as sharp though.

Interesting coverage defense by the Bears on a third down. Showed blitz, only for defenders to back out away from the line of scrimmage leaving only three people to rush the passer. These defenders backing off took away the crossing routes two of the Chargers skill players were running.

Joey Bosa making key plays in the first quarter alone.

Chargers defense on long third downs is just abysmal.

Chicago's offensive line is showing some serious symptoms of incompetency.

The Chargers offensive line is just as bad.

Kudos to Trubisky for completing a few big plays, but the Bears red zone offense is truly pathetic. It seems Nagy doesn't full trust his quarterback in goal-to-go situations either. Not to mention it doesn't help that Mitch no longer runs around like he used to.

To the Bears credit, their offense found themselves in the red zone on five different occasions in the first half. And yet, not a single touchdown was scored. Sure, Trubisky could be to blame for the offense's ineptitude for the red zone, but I'm also seeing Matt Nagy's gimmick plays and goal-to-go plays fail to move the ball past the goal line. This Bears offense is hopeless if it needs to rely on Trubisky dropping back to pass, which seems more and more to be the case as teams have gotten a beat on the exotic plays the Bears like to run.

The Bears finally strung together a quality touchdown drive, mainly by calling 6 straight runs and then using some drive momentum on a deep throw to Allen Robinson. Chargers seem to have issues bottling up the run.

Bears like their zone coverage in this game. Fine by Rivers, he's not having many problems here. So long as the Chargers hold up in pass protection, Rivers can operate here.

## Jets @ Jaguars

Jacksonville roasted the Jets with an inside run against an 8-man box. Not a good sign for New York.

Jaguars soft zone defense not doing much of anything.

Jets smartly using quick plays on offense to matriculate the ball downfield.

Minshew working his magic and delivering a perfect ball on a scramble away from pressure.

The Jets left tackle is a liability.

Jets cornerbacks are affording receivers too much space on blitz situations.

Minshew doing well reading Gregg Williams' blitz schemes.

Ever since giving up a big run to Fournette on that early run, the Jets run defense has been stout.

The entire Jets offensive line is a major liability in pass protection. Only the right tackle seems somewhat qualified to be playing in the professional league here.

Two fumbles by the Jaguars on special teams. Sloppy.

Jets blitz pick-up is still lame. But Gase is starting to adjust late in the game by calling quick passes and occasional gadget plays to keep the heat off Darnold.

Deceptive blitz by the Jaguars forced a bad throw from Darnold on a short field.

***

## Dolphins @ Steelers

Miami willing to gamble. The defense tried a jailbreak blitz on a 3rd-and-20 in order to push the Steelers out of field goal range. Instead, Mason Rudolph was able to hit a short crosser for a long-developing 45-yard touchdown.

Fitzpatrick a major gambler, even under pressure. No surprise.

Rudolph developing a taste for Juju Smith-Schuster.

Miami's defensive backs are liabilities in coverage. Pair that with one of the weaker defensive lines in the league and you have a pretty shitty defense.

***

## Buccaneers @ Titans

On the first drive, the Buccaneers could have scored. But two bad decisions by Winston killed any chance at a touchdown. The first bad decision came when he tried to force a throw to Mike Evans under heavy coverage. The second bad decision was not diagnosing man-to-man coverage before the snap and throwing to his tight end crossing over the formation from behind the line of scrimmage.

Jameis messing up a snap ends up giving the Titans a goal-to-go touchdown.

Tampa Bay loves running between their tackles on zone schemes.

Ryan Tannehill isn't immune to bad quarterback play either. Some of his first quarter decisions have already been questionable. Not to mention his anticipation needs to be called into question.

In part due to a tip, Winston throws another interception that gifts the Titans with yet another goal-to-go touchdown.

Why do the Titans have fade routes in their red zone package?

Jameis under pressure has been unusually good.
