## Giants @ Lions

Why does Pat Shurmur run on 2nd and long? Why is this a thing in the NFL?

Giants run defense once again choking up yardage to opposing rushers.

Jones is rough. The kid is still holding on to balls recklessly. And Shurmur telegraphing run plays doesn't help the situation.

Giants offensive playbook seems to favor high-low routes where a receiver runs a slant route to the outside while the inside receiver crosses underneath to the flat. Daniel Jones seems to prefer throwing to the deeper receiver, even in tight coverage.

Darius Slayton may be a beast in the making for the Giants. Finally, something worthy of taking that Hakeem Nicks role.

## Eagles @ Bills

Josh Allen's ability to run is really tasking these coverage defenders patrolling the flat. The threat of Josh Allen scrambling has these defenders dropping off their assignments.

## Browns @ Patriots

Greedy Williams and Denzel Ward playing well in their return.

Once again, the Browns shooting themselves in the foot with penalties.

New England's passing offense is definitely suspect. It seems the team only found consistent success through their screen game and improvisational plays. If it wasn't for the defense, the game would have been competitive well into the fourth quarter.

## Packers @ Chiefs

More blitzing by the Chiefs linebackers and safeties leading to positive results.

Lots of window dressing before the snap serving the Chiefs well, confusing this Packers defense. It also helps that the Packers are regularly overcompensating in their coverage on Tyreek Hill.

The Chiefs' linebackers are liabilities in coverage, particularly in 5-wide situations.

The creative plays that were sustaining the Chiefs early in the game have largely disappeared. Reid only drew up so many of them, apparently. Late game magic for the Chiefs largely boils down to the quarterback's ability to create plays.
