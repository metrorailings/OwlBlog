My Supercontest picks sucked this week.

Not really too interested in dwelling too much on why my selections didn't pan out, although I do want to give a bit of a breakdown of the Kansas City/Denver game.

As I expected, Kansas City would post at least 30 points. But what took me by surprise was Case Keenum. Arrowhead Stadium is usually the place where bad quarterbacks go to finally die. Just look at Blake Bortles and his downfall following his poor showing in Arrowhead earlier in the season.

But Keenum held his own, bolstering my preseason expectation that the man would actually be serviceable as a starting quarterback for the Broncos.

Three big plays drove Denver towards the cover here. All of them are pass plays. Watch the GIFs below:

These plays only serve to remind me that despite their success last week against the Bengals, the Chiefs still have one of the worst pass defenses in this league. It won't really change either, as the the whole defense shares the blames for their coverage woes. Just look at the plays above -

* The first big pass play came largely as a result of a gamble by edge rusher Dee Ford to crash down on the inside of the pocket, which allowed Keenum to run to his right and extend the play some more.
* The second big pass play came because cornerback Steven Nelson was simply unable to match up physically against receiver Courtland Sutton.
* The third big pass play came because the Chiefs secondary completely blew assignments and left one receiver wide open in the end zone.

And now the Chiefs are heading to Ohio to play the Browns, a team that I think is now galvanized after [Dumb & Dumber](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/sites/csnma/files/styles/article_hero_image/public/2018/10/29/jackson-haley-apusat.png?itok=yZ8LX9uw) were canned yesterday. Baker Mayfield has been playing well, despite his skill players constantly disappointing him. But the firings of their head coach and offensive coordinator may be the kick in the ass his receivers finally need to shape up and play well next Sunday.
