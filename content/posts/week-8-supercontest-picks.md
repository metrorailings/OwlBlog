My picks last week were...better. The Panthers, Steelers, and Buccaneers all turned in strong performances against their respective performances. Still, my two losses were pretty bad, especially my loss on Monday night. Nagy and his offense were flatly clowned against the Rams. I banked on Chicago's defense preventing the Rams from scoring too many points, but what good is a top-flight defense if the offense is absolutely pathetic. Running for two yards a pop won't be winning the Bears any more games, period.

My other loss was the New England Patriots. I never expected them to implode the way they did, but it's clear Cam Newton isn't the quarterback to lead this team to sustained success. The minute injuries surface with him, his poor mechanics and technique show themselves in the _worst_ possible way. On top of that, free agency exits and draft busts have left this Patriot team bereft of quality players. Having the best coach in the game means little if the talent isn't there, period.

That being said, I'm going to continue building here until I can finally start nailing almost all my picks on any given week. So let's begin here.

***

### Raiders @ Browns (-3)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Buccaneers** (45) @ Raiders (20)  
**Browns** (37) @ Bengals (34)

#### _Record_

Raiders (3-3)  
Browns (5-2)

#### _Injuries_

On Cleveland's side, Baker's ribs still remain a point of concern. The loss of Odell Beckham Jr will have an impact in the passing game, regardless of what some idiots on ESPN think.

Las Vegas is expected to come into this game pretty healthy.

#### _History_

Not much relevant history here. Cleveland has feasted in the past against bad defenses. Las Vegas defense will be stressed here, especially as they haven't faced a Kubiak-style offense since last year.

#### _Weather_

45 degrees with winds over 20 miles an hour. Possible chance of rain too.

***

Browns -3

***

**Cleveland covers if**  
the Browns dominates the time of possession against an \~Oakland\~ Las Vegas defense that can't rush the passer or stop dominant rushers from motoring down the field.

**Las Vegas covers if**  
Josh Jacobs and Derek Carr can control the ball longer than their counterparts in Cleveland. A possibility if the Raiders are particularly motivated coming off a loss and they catch the Browns slacking.

***

### Saints @ Bears (+4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Panthers (24) @ **Saints** (27)  
Bears (10) @ **Rams** (24)

#### _Record_

Saints (4-2)  
Bears (5-2)

#### _Injuries_

Half of New Orleans receivers will likely be out for this game, including their top two players on the depth chart - Michael Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders.

The Bears will be missing key pieces on offense, namely receiver Allen Robinson and center Cody Whitehair.

#### _History_

Chicago has spent much of this season beating up on bad teams. Their two losses came against teams with decent defenses. New Orleans pass defense needs a bit of work, but the rushing defense is solid. Still, red zone possessions seem to be a death sentence for this defense, as New Orleans gives up touchdowns on over 80% of opponents' red zone trips. Then again, Chicago needs to move the ball down the field for that statistic to even play much a role in this game.

#### _Weather_

36 degrees with winds over 20 miles per hour.

***

Saints -4.5

***

**New Orleans covers if**  
Chicago's offense stalls yet again thanks in part to the Saints hitting home with their pass rush.

**Chicago covers if**  
the Bears make major revisions to their offensive strategy following an embarrassing Monday night performance and Nick Foles finally revealing his honest thoughts on the offense. It would also help if the Bears prevent Alvin Kamara from racking up yards after the catch.

***

### Patriots @ Bills (-3.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**49ers** (33) @ Patriots (6)  
**Bills** (18) @ Jets (10)

#### _Record_

Patriots (2-4)  
Bills (5-2)

#### _Injuries_

Joe Thuney is a point of concern for the Patriots going into this game. Another big issue may be the absence of Edelman and N'Keal Harry. Without Edelman and Harry, the Patriots have no receivers worth a damn to field. But the biggest worry here is Cam Newton himself - last week tells me something's off with Newton, especially as the Patriots only opted to use him on a designed run just _once_ in their first three drives.

For the Bills, Matt Milano's injuries doesn't help out a defense that has had issues defending against the run.

#### _History_

Twice, the Patriots faced the Bills last year. Twice did they win by only one score. But that New England team was drastically different with Tom Brady at its helm. This year's Patriots squad is depressingly worse. The Bills (arguably) are better than they were last year.

#### _Weather_

43 degrees with winds right around the 20 mile per hour mark. Rain is guaranteed. In fact, it's possible that some of that rain may turn to snow.

***

Bills -3.5

***

**Buffalo covers if**  
the Bills can stone any type of run game the Patriots try to mount.

**New England covers if**  
their halfbacks run roughshod all over Buffalo's defense.

***

### Titans @ Bengals (+5.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Steelers** (27) @ Titans (24)  
**Browns** (37) @ Bengals (34)

#### Record

Titans (5-1)  
Bengals (1-5)

#### _Injuries_

Tennessee may not have Jadaveon Clowney ready for game day. Then again, that probably doesn't matter much.

Cincinnati's issues are much more grave. Three of their starting offensive linemen have serious injuries. One's already been declared out. The good news is that their replacements didn't fail horribly when their cards were called last Sunday.

#### _History_

In a few ways, the Titans can be seen in the same light as the Browns - both are teams layering play-action concepts on top of zone-running schemes. Both organizations also feature terrible defenses.  

The Bengals have faced the Browns twice and covered in both games. Though it's worth noting Ryan Tannehill is a far better quarterback than Baker Mayfield, so this comparison can only hold so much value.

#### _Weather_

Chilly weather at 45 degrees.

***

Titans -5.5

***

**Tennessee covers if**  
the Titans defense can force Cincinnati to punt or cede the ball on the majority of their offensive possessions.

**Cincinnati covers if**  
the majority of their drives end up yielding points.
