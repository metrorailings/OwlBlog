My picks last week were...better. The Panthers, Steelers, and Buccaneers all turned in strong performances against their respective performances. Still, my two losses were pretty bad, especially my loss on Monday night. Nagy and his offense were flatly clowned against the Rams. I banked on Chicago's defense preventing the Rams from scoring too many points, but what good is a top-flight defense if the offense is absolutely pathetic. Running for two yards a pop won't be winning the Bears any more games, period.

### Browns @ Bengals (+3)

#### _Latest Results_

Browns (7) @ **Steelers** (38)  
Bengals (27) @ **Colts** (31)

#### _Record_

Browns (4-2)  
Bengals (1-4)

#### _Injuries_

On Cleveland's side, the major concern still remains at quarterback. Baker's sore ribs weren't helped at all last week against Pittsburgh.

On Cincinnati's side, the biggest concern is Joe Mixon. If Mixon is absent, Cincinnati may be down its most dynamic playmaker.

#### _History_

The Bengals and Browns have met just five weeks before. That match ended up being a rout in favor of the Browns, though the Bengals fought their way to a backdoor cover.

**Cleveland covers if**  
Nothing much changes from their first match-up earlier in the year. In that game, Cleveland's halfbacks ran wild all over a Cincinnati defense missing  talented tackles along their defensive line.

**Cincinnati covers again if**  
the Bengals do a much better job keeping a lid on Cleveland's rushing attack. A possibility, given that the Bengals are now much more intimate with Stefanski's scheme.
