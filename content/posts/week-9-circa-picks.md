Once again, another 3-2 week. Circumstances though were a bit more excusable - I never expected Vikings to lay the type of egg they laid Sunday night against a quarterback with only three passes to his name in the NFL. It was an irrefutably pathetic showing, proof positive that the Vikings are a bad team not to be trusted to give away points.

Let's aim a bit higher this weekend, especially as we begin a new quarter.

***

### Packers @ Chiefs (-7.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Patriots** @ Cardinals (TNF)  
Giants @ **Chiefs** (MNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

Aaron Rodgers is out of this game with COVID. I repeat, Aaron Rodgers is out for this game. Most other injuries seem trivial compared to that, no? That being said, Davante Adams returning to action should help out Jordan Love as he makes his first ever start.

Chiefs are fairly healthy.

#### _History_

Patrick Mahomes is not playing well. For whatever reason, the boy isn't in the right frame of mind for whatever reason. The Green Bay Packers aren't exactly a shabby defense known for surrendering easy yards either in the pass game - if Mahomes is to ever right the ship this season, it likely won't come against this Packer defense.

#### _Weather_

Cool windy day with clear skies

Packers +7.5

**Green Bay covers if**  
the offense doesn't lose much of its potency despite Jordan Love starting at quarterback. Certainly possible if Green Bay uses their smashing ground game to stay productive on offense while Love settles into the flow of things.

**Kansas City covers if**  
Green Bay loses most of its mojo on offense without its primary signal caller on the field  
\- OR -  
Joe Burry fails to adequately devote enough resources in coverage to Tyreek Hill  
\- OR -  
the offense finally kicks its addiction to big plays. Kansas could so easily move the ball by running more plays designed to net small yardage, but the Chiefs need to admit they have an addiction first before committing to an offense predicated on steady production.
