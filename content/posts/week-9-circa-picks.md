Once again, another 3-2 week. Circumstances though were a bit more excusable - I never expected Vikings to lay the type of egg they laid Sunday night against a quarterback with only three passes to his name in the NFL. It was an irrefutably pathetic showing, proof positive that the Vikings are a bad team not to be trusted to give away points.

Let's aim a bit higher this weekend, especially as we begin a new quarter.

***

### Packers @ Chiefs (-7.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Patriots** @ Cardinals (TNF)  
Giants @ **Chiefs** (MNF)

#### _Key Injuries_

Aaron Rodgers is out of this game with COVID. I repeat, Aaron Rodgers is out for this game. Most other injuries seem trivial compared to that, no? That being said, Davante Adams returning to action should help out Jordan Love as he makes his first ever start.

Chiefs are fairly healthy.

#### _History_

Patrick Mahomes is not playing well. For whatever reason, the boy isn't in the right frame of mind for whatever reason. The Green Bay Packers aren't exactly a shabby defense known for surrendering easy yards either in the pass game - if Mahomes is to ever right the ship this season, it likely won't come against this Packer defense.

#### _Weather_

Cool windy day with clear skies

***

Packers +7.5

**Green Bay covers if**  
the offense doesn't lose much of its potency despite Jordan Love starting at quarterback. Certainly possible if Green Bay uses their smashing ground game to stay productive on offense while Love settles into the flow of things.

**Kansas City covers if**  
Green Bay loses most of its mojo on offense without its primary signal caller on the field  
\- OR -  
Joe Burry fails to adequately devote enough resources in coverage to Tyreek Hill  
\- OR -  
the offense finally kicks its addiction to big plays. Kansas can so easily move the ball by running more plays designed to net small yardage, but the Chiefs need to admit they have an addiction first before committing to an offense predicated to a more boring form of production.

### Browns @ Bengals (-2.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Steelers** @ Browns  
Bengals @ **Jets**

#### _Key Injuries_

Browns and Bengals seem decent, from a health perspective. Cleveland will be missing the services of Jack Conklin for several weeks, at least.

#### _History_

These two face each other twice annually. Last year, the Browns swept Cincinnati in high-scoring affairs. This year, the Bengals have recruited Ja'Marr Chase to give Joe Burrow a signature weapon in the passing game. Meanwhile, the Browns sharpened their pass rush this year by renovating their defensive front - Myles Garrett is now joined by Jadaveon Clowney, Malik Jackson, and Tak McKinley as the new faces defining Cleveland's pass rush. Will these changes matter ultimately? Not too sure.

#### _Weather_

Autumn weather

***

Undetermined

***

**Cleveland covers if**  
their defensive front completely overwhelms Cincinatti's offensive line for the majority of the game.

**Cincinnati covers if**  
Joe Mixon and Samaje Perine can chew off more than 4.5 yards per carry on average. Establishing the ground game takes the burden off an offensive line incapable of protecting Joe Burrow.
