## Jets @ Colts

The Jets third-down defense is way too predictable with its man coverage. I need to see a couple more third-downs, but it seems New York very much prefers to run man coverage.

On a clear running situation, the Colts were able to hammer Taylor right up the middle despite New York having four defensive tackles lined up inside.
