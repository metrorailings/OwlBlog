## Jets @ Colts

The Jets third-down defense is way too predictable with its man coverage. I need to see a couple more third-downs, but it seems New York very much prefers to run man coverage.

On a clear running situation, the Colts were able to hammer Taylor right up the middle despite New York having four defensive tackles lined up inside.

## Raiders @ Giants

Derek Carr once again throwing the ball well under pressure and with anticipation. His evolution this year has never been more clear.

Hunter Renfrow is a critical player for this Raider offense. As soon as he leaves, this offense stalls.

Yannick Ngakoue with a big sack fumble changing the tenor of the game.

Devontae Booker making some real hay on the ground, thanks to some solid blocking from the offensive line. It also helps that the Raiders are playing a bit soft in their pass coverage.

Good study from the Raiders defense, not biting on the fake receiver screen knowing that Kadarius Toney can also throw the ball.

Without Henry Ruggs and Hunter Renfrow, the Raiders offense seems to have died. I need to see what the Giants are doing exactly to take Darren Waller out of this game. My hunch is they're bracketing him in coverage, forcing Carr to look elsewhere for a more open window.

## Vikings @ Ravens

Cousins has regressed as a pocket passer. It just isn't there. Or perhaps this offense isn't giving him any sort of hot reads or audibles.

***

## Chargers @ Eagles

Odds. Eagles come out of this game emphasizing the passing game. Why? Nick Sirianni, you can't be this inept. Either that or the Eagles analytical department is absolutely hellbent on passing the ball.

This Chargers defense is not good. It struggles way too much to defend the ground game. And the defense is all too willing to take gambles against a quarterback willing to make a living with his legs.

DaVonte Smith is a truly awesome player here. Chargers have him adequately covered and Jalen Hurts is still finding him in critical moments.

Kudos to the Eagles offense for incorporating an increased tempo to keep the Chargers defense gassed.

The Chargers insistance on running the ball has been damn near self-destructive. Los Angeles is not acting in its best interest. I know you're trying to set a tone, Brandon Staley, but winning the game is a bit more important at the end of the 4th quarter. It's disappointing to see the Chargers sticking so hopelessly to a failed vector of attack.

## Cardinals @ 49ers

Negative game script killed a drive early for the 49ers.

Another promising drive killed by a fumble. These 49ers are playing so sloppy.

Pass protection has been fantastic for Arizona. It's clear the line learned from their bad play last time they played the 49ers.

Colt McCoy has been fantastic. It's clear he was amped for this game.

***

## Packers @ Chiefs

Jordan Love is still nervous. Arrowhead is not an easy place to play football. He needs a good half under him.

Trusting Mason Crosby may have been risky enough as is, but trusting him in the face of wind was foolish on my part. Two missed field goals in the first three drives.

The Chiefs are still making mistakes. Mahomes throwing deep into nonexistent windows, Kelce dropping passes....

A very promising fourth quarter Packers drive killed because LaFleur opts to have Love pass three straight times. Love has trouble reading blitzes, let alone throwing accurate passes. It's clear that for all the advantages the Shanahan system is supposed to bestow upon this offense,  Aaron Rodgers is the heart and soul of Green Bay's offensive unit. Without him, the offense fails.

The mark of a good coach is to win even when dealt a horrible set of cards. I thought LaFleur may have turned a corner last week when Green Bay won against undefeated Arizona despite not having any of their primary receivers suit up. I'm starting to realize the Packers owe that win almost entirely to Rodgers brilliance than anything else. His ability to read defenses, organize confused receivers, and direct the ground game was the difference maker. Matt LaFleur didn't actually end up doing much.

No up-tempo, no leaning on the ground game, no easy short passes cooked up for his young quarterback, no options....

***

## Titans @ Rams

Titans defensive line is completely owning the Rams offensive line as they try to play traditional drop back football.

In the second half, Los Angeles was finally able to produce some yards on offense by moving the offensive line laterally, regardless of whether they're running the ball or passing the ball.

Demico Autry and Jeffery Simmons may be the real deal. Pair them with Harold Landry and Bud Dupree and the Titans could have the best defensive line in the game, bar none.

***

## Falcons @ Saints

Cordarelle and Kyle Pitts are definitely the primary weapons of the offense.

Matt Ryan negotiating pressure well. That being said, he threw a near-pick to a Saints cornerback.

Saints are gashing the Falcons for chunks of yardage on the ground. Atlanta's run defense starting to worry me. Carolina pulled off similar tricks on them last week.

Two delay of game penalties on the same drive for the Saints, right after a holding penalty too. Their mental state coming into this game is pretty obvious at this point.

Once again, Matt Ryan's pocket movement cannot be praised enough. I have nothing but respect seeing him dance and juke out defenders.

Russell Gage becoming a significant contributor on this Atlanta offense. Somebody needed to fill Calvin Ridley's shoes, I suppose...

Trevor Siemian not playing bad at all. Some of his balls can be better placed, but his decisions have been above par.

***

## Broncos @ Cowboys

Dallas had two fourth downs they just couldn't convert kill their first two drives. Both drives were promising.

Randy Gregory is so damn aggressive with his pass rush that it compromises the run defense sometimes. In fact, Dallas defensive front in general can be really aggressive at times. Their urge to shoot through gaps can really be a liability against solid rushing teams. Though they managed to handle the Vikings well last week.

Trayvon Diggs is just horrible in coverage. Fantastic at generating turnovers, but horrible in coverage duty otherwise.

It's clear Dallas offense isn't firing on all cylinders. Probably of combination of lingering injuries and the hangover that comes from an emotional win last week.

Micah Parsons clearly the Cowboys best pass rusher.

***

## Patriots @ Panthers

What's up with Sam Darnold and his low passes? Two of them have been batted, one nearly resulting in an interception. And we're barely out of the first quarter.

It's clear the Panthers aren't trusting Darnold with the keys to this offense. Their commitment to the ground game is obvious from the get-go.

Carolina's offensive line is in shambles. Worrisome.

Patriots have multiple men that can rush the ball. This Stevenson guy has some fire in him.

New England is absolutely blowing up all the bootlegs Carolina's trying to run.
