## Jets @ Colts

The Jets third-down defense is way too predictable with its man coverage. I need to see a couple more third-downs, but it seems New York very much prefers to run man coverage.

On a clear running situation, the Colts were able to hammer Taylor right up the middle despite New York having four defensive tackles lined up inside.

## Raiders @ Giants

Derek Carr once again throwing the ball well under pressure and with anticipation. His evolution this year has never been more clear.

Hunter Renfrow is a critical player for this Raider offense. As soon as he leaves, this offense stalls.

Yannick Ngakoue with a big sack fumble changing the tenor of the game.

Devontae Booker making some real hay on the ground, thanks to some solid blocking from the offensive line. It also helps that the Raiders are playing a bit soft in their pass coverage.
