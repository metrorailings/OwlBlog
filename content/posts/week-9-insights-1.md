## Jets @ Colts

The Jets third-down defense is way too predictable with its man coverage. I need to see a couple more third-downs, but it seems New York very much prefers to run man coverage.

On a clear running situation, the Colts were able to hammer Taylor right up the middle despite New York having four defensive tackles lined up inside.

## Raiders @ Giants

Derek Carr once again throwing the ball well under pressure and with anticipation. His evolution this year has never been more clear.

Hunter Renfrow is a critical player for this Raider offense. As soon as he leaves, this offense stalls.

Yannick Ngakoue with a big sack fumble changing the tenor of the game.

Devontae Booker making some real hay on the ground, thanks to some solid blocking from the offensive line. It also helps that the Raiders are playing a bit soft in their pass coverage.

Good study from the Raiders defense, not biting on the fake receiver screen knowing that Kadarius Toney can also throw the ball.

Without Henry Ruggs and Hunter Renfrow, the Raiders offense seems to have died. I need to see what the Giants are doing exactly to take Darren Waller out of this game. My hunch is they're bracketing him in coverage, forcing Carr to look elsewhere for a more open window.

## Vikings @ Ravens

Cousins has regressed as a pocket passer. It just isn't there. Or perhaps this offense isn't giving him any sort of hot reads or audibles.

## Chargers @ Eagles

Odds. Eagles come out of this game emphasizing the passing game. Why? Nick Sirianni, you can't be this inept. Either that or the Eagles analytical department is absolutely hellbent on passing the ball.
