## Giants @ Washington

For the first time this season, the Giants are running the ball with some serious passion. Alfred Morris is gashing this Washington defense between the tackles.

Landon Collins understudy on the Washington defense may be a point of weakness.

## Dolphins @ Cardinals

Cardinals love to play up-tempo.

Arizona's defensive line stupidly gifting yards to the Miami offense here, despite Tua playing pretty terribly. Sloppy play may be the theme of this defense.

So much for Arizona having the best red zone defense in the league.

It's clear the Dolphins except the Cardinals to run on first down most of the time. And that seems to be the case too.

Kyler Murray really prefers throwing deep balls over short passes too.

Xavien Howard cannot cover DeAndre Hopkins.y is very real.

Tua's running ability has been absolutely critical on one drive that ended in a touchdown.

Arizona's blitzing packages put quite a bit of pressure on their secondary, especially if a defensive back is the one vacating his position to try and pressure the quarterback. Arizona's second-string defensive backs are having serious issues trying to compensate on the pass coverage on these blitz attempts.

These Cardinals are so damn predictable with their first-down runs. When are you going to cash in on that predictability with a surprise bootleg or something?

## Steelers @ Cowboys

Goes without saying yet again, but Pollard is so much more explosive compared to Zeke Elliott.

Steelers have a hard time containing runs starting from spread formations.
