## Giants @ Washington

For the first time this season, the Giants are running the ball with some serious passion. Alfred Morris is gashing this Washington defense between the tackles.

Landon Collins understudy on the Washington defense may be a point of weakness.

## Dolphins @ Cardinals

Cardinals love to play up-tempo.

Arizona's defensive line stupidly gifting yards to the Miami offense here, despite Tua playing pretty terribly.
