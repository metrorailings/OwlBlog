## Giants @ Washington

For the first time this season, the Giants are running the ball with some serious passion. Alfred Morris is gashing this Washington defense between the tackles.

Landon Collins understudy on the Washington defense may be a point of weakness.

## Dolphins @ Cardinals

Cardinals love to play up-tempo.

Arizona's defensive line stupidly gifting yards to the Miami offense here, despite Tua playing pretty terribly. Sloppy play may be the theme of this defense.

So much for Arizona having the best red zone defense in the league.

It's clear the Dolphins except the Cardinals to run on first down most of the time. And that seems to be the case too.

Kyler Murray really prefers throwing deep balls over short passes too.

Xavien Howard cannot cover DeAndre Hopkins.y is very real.

Tua's running ability has been absolutely critical on one drive that ended in a touchdown.

Arizona's blitzing packages put quite a bit of pressure on their secondary, especially if a defensive back is the one vacating his position to try and pressure the quarterback. Arizona's second-string defensive backs are having serious issues trying to compensate on the pass coverage on these blitz attempts.

These Cardinals are so damn predictable with their first-down runs. When are you going to cash in on that predictability with a surprise bootleg or something?

## Steelers @ Cowboys

Goes without saying yet again, but Pollard is so much more explosive compared to Zeke Elliott.

Steelers have a hard time containing runs starting from spread formations.

***

## Saints @ Buccaneers

Saints offensive line has dominated Tampa Bay's pass rushers.

Arians and his teams need to always have their heart called into question. The Buccaneers simply aren't fighting for the win here. New Orleans has been the one playing this game with more purpose. How do you let Brees distribute this ball to 8 different receivers in the first quarter?

Zone defense simply doesn't get it done against Drew Brees.

Tampa Bay might have read way too many of their press clippings before the game.

Lavonte David, on more than one occasion, was caught with his pants down at the snap because he was too busy trying to shuffle defenders into place. Something tells me this team didn't do much to prepare for this game.

You know, I suppose it's hard to sell the fighting spirit to a team when they're a decisive favorite to win the game, period. Tampa Bay needed this game badly in order to win favorable seeding and they're out there acting as if this is just a preseason outing.

Trey Hendrickson and Marcus Davenport showing themselves as serious pass rushers.

## Seahawks @ Bills

Josh Allen's grandmother passed away yesterday. He may be playing with a fury today.

Odd for Russell Wilson to throw a ball to David Moore with Tre'Davious White in coverage...

Seattle likes to blitz. Those blitzes aren't really hitting home.

Good discipline by the Bills defense on a critical 4th down. Also helps that Buffalo seems to be winning its battles along the middle of the trenches.

Seattle playing quite a bit of nickel defense against Buffalo. Apparently, the team is respecting the Bills passing game more than its ground game. Either that or they're putting more defensive backs on the field to help its coverage on blitzes. It doesn't seem to matter much though, because Seattle's lack of pass rush is giving Allen time to find open receivers.

DK Metcalf is a beast. Goes without saying.

These Seahawk corners give waaaay too much space to these Bill receivers.
