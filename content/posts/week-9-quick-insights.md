## Texans @ Jaguars (London)

Leonard Fournette being a power runner doesn't bode well for a Jaguars team playing from behind.

Remind me to never side with a rookie quarterback in his second outing against a division opponent. The Texans are not getting any pressure on Minshew, but that doesn't seem to matter as Houston seems to have gotten a beat on the Jaguars passing tendencies. The Texans' coverage schemes are taking away many of the offensive concepts Minshew has gotten comfortable executing. Without those easy throws, Minshew is left spooked.

Then again, it also hurts that Minshew is lacking a playmaker in Dede Westbrook today.

## Colts @ Steelers

Jabaal Sheard may be the Colts' best defensive linemen. Making stops against the run and against 4th down trick plays too.

The Colts offensive line is incredibly dominant. The Steelers pass rush is nearly nonexistent. Brian Hoyer is being given too much time to pick apart the Steelers zone defense.

Zone defense is too risky when you don't have the horses to execute that style of defense. And the Colts matriculating the ball downfield with ease tells me that the Steelers don't have those horses.

The Colts defense played so well on the last drive, forcing the Steelers into short passes that essentially drained clock. Had it not been for an overzealous Darius Leonard, the Steelers would have done nothing on that last drive. Frank reich and Matt Eburfleus have this team excellently coached.
