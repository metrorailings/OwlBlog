## Texans @ Jaguars (London)

Leonard Fournette being a power runner doesn't bode well for a Jaguars team playing from behind.

Remind me to never side with a rookie quarterback in his second outing against a division opponent. The Texans are not getting any pressure on Minshew, but that doesn't seem to matter as Houston seems to have gotten a beat on the Jaguars passing tendencies. The Texans' coverage schemes are taking away many of the offensive concepts Minshew has gotten comfortable executing. Without those easy throws, Minshew is left spooked.

Then again, it also hurts that Minshew is lacking a playmaker in Dede Westbrook today.
