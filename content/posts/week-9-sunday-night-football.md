##### _Packers (+5)_ @ Patriots

Listen, it's always risky betting against the Patriots, but their defense is a little too tepid for my liking. The Packers will cover so long as Bill Belichick's defense fail to keep Aaron Rodger's receivers bottled up under man coverage. As I keep saying, the Packers can be routed so long as you have a defensive secondary that can perform reasonably well in man-to-man defense. If you don't have such a secondary, expect Rodgers to run up some scores on you.

That being said, the only truly solid corner the Patriots are fielding is Stephon Gilmore, which would normally be a cause for concern if New England was coached by anybody but Bill Belichick. But the Darth has a way of bringing out better performances from his defensive personnel on certain weeks. Now would be the week for his defensive backs to step up and make Aaron Rodgers hold the ball long enough so that Trey Flowers to hit home. 

Now even if the Packers see some of their drives stall through the game, Green Bay can still cover the spread. The Packers boast a quality pass rush that can throw Brady off on some of his drives. So I like Green Bay quite a bit here.

Of course, whenever I end up liking a side a _little too much,_ the betting gods find a way to fuck me. So beware here...
