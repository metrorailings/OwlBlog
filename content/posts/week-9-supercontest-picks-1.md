My picks last week were trending up. Three of my picks were just money. A fourth pick was a close loss. The last pick (Tennessee) ended up being embarrassingly wrong. Goddamn Titans...the one week they decide to take a break.

If there was a lesson to be learned last week, it's that teams do tend to relax at certain points on their schedule. Identifying these low points in their schedule could bring home some lovely moneybags.

### Saints @ Buccaneers (-4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Buccaneers** (25) @ Giants (23)  
**Saints** (26) @ Bears (23)

#### _Record_

Saints (5-2)  
Buccaneers (6-2)

#### _Injuries_

The Saints find themselves worrying about their quarterback. Brees has been listed on the injury report this week with a right shoulder injury. That's also his throwing shoulder. Brees has been playing soft as is, refusing to throw the ball down the field. An injury won't be helping his cause.

For the Bucs, a few key piece of their offense are banged up, notably Chris Godwin and Scotty Miller. It's possible Godwin will be sidelined for the game.

#### _History_

The game earlier in the season is irrelevant here. Even though the Saints dominated their home opener, it was Brady's first game with Tampa Bay. It was clear Tom wasn't ready to marshal an offense very different from the one he ran in New England for the past two decades. On top of that, Gronk was still hungover from a year's worth of partying.

It took a few weeks, but Brady, Gronkowski, and the rest of the Buccaneers have now finally gelled into a cohesive unit. The Saints defense will be facing a very different squad from the one they faced in that first week of the season.

#### _Weather_

A lovely 70-degree night, albeit with winds over 20 miles.

Buccaneers -3

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
their defense (in recognizing this game is critical towards winning the division) manages to limit Kamara's production. It would also help if Antonio Brown's debut as a Buccaneer excites this offense into running up the score.

**New Orleans covers if**  
Alvin Kamara goes off and Drew Brees is solid on short and intermediate passes despite his bum shoulder.
