My picks last week were trending up. Three of my picks were just money. A fourth pick was a close loss. The last pick (Tennessee) ended up being embarrassingly wrong. Goddamn Titans...the one week they decide to take a break.

If there was a lesson to be learned last week, it's that teams do tend to relax at certain points on their schedule. Identifying these low points in their schedule could bring home some lovely moneybags.

### Saints @ Buccaneers (-4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Buccaneers** (25) @ Giants (23)  
**Saints** (26) @ Bears (23)

#### _Record_

Saints (5-2)  
Buccaneers (6-2)

#### _Injuries_

The Saints find themselves worrying about their quarterback. Brees has been listed on the injury report this week with a right shoulder injury. That's also his throwing shoulder. Brees has been playing soft as is, refusing to throw the ball down the field. An injury won't be helping his cause.

For the Bucs, a few key piece of their offense are banged up, notably Chris Godwin and Scotty Miller. It's possible Godwin will be sidelined for the game.

#### _History_

The game earlier in the season is irrelevant here. Even though the Saints dominated their home opener, it was Brady's first game with Tampa Bay. It was clear Tom wasn't ready to marshal an offense very different from the one he ran in New England for the past two decades. On top of that, Gronk was still hungover from a year's worth of partying.

It took a few weeks, but Brady, Gronkowski, and the rest of the Buccaneers have now finally gelled into a cohesive unit. The Saints defense will be facing a very different squad from the one they faced in that first week of the season.

#### _Weather_

A lovely 70-degree night, albeit with winds over 20 miles.

Buccaneers -3

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
their defense (in recognizing this game is critical towards winning the division) manages to limit Kamara's production. It would also help if Antonio Brown's debut as a Buccaneer excites this offense into running up the score.

**New Orleans covers if**  
Alvin Kamara goes off and Drew Brees is solid on short and intermediate passes despite his bum shoulder.

### Texans @ Jaguars (+7)

***

#### _Latest Results_

BYE - **Packers** (35) @ Texans (20)  
BYE - Jaguars (29) @ **Chargers** (39)

#### _Record_

Texans (1-6)  
Jaguars (1-6)

#### _Injuries_

With Gardner Minshew recovering from a serious thumb injury, late round rookie Jake Luton will be taking over at the helm of the offense.

On the other side, Houston will be missing the services of their starting linebackers this Sunday due to possible COVID exposure. Benardrick McKinney is also out due to injury.

#### _History_

The Jaguars and Texans met earlier this year. Jacksonville honestly didn't play all too shabby either - Houston only covered thanks to two turnovers, one by downs and one by fumble.

One note of caution though - that game featured Gardner Minshew as Jacksonville's quarterback.

#### _Weather_

Balmy with some considerable humidity.

***

Jaguars +7

***

**Jacksonville covers if**  
The Texans underestimate Jake Luton and allow him to connect on some deep throws. The Jaguars also need to play better defensively this time around - Josh Allen's presence in this game should be a boon in that regard given that he was absent from their first meeting. 

**Houston covers if**  
Jake Luton turns out to be an absolute bust in his first NFL outing.

### Panthers @ Chiefs (-10.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Falcons** (25) @ Panthers (17)  
Jets (9) @ **Chiefs** (35)

#### _Record_

Panthers (3-5)  
Chiefs (7-1)

#### _History_

Arguably, the Panthers have yet to face a truly explosive offense this year. Still, they've faced teams that relied on man coverage, and the results have been iffy to say the least. Chicago was able to stifle their short routes with man coverage.

Kansas City hasn't fared well against teams that run the ball well either. Las Vegas handed them their only loss largely because the Raiders were able to control time of possession with their ground game. It could be argued New England could have beaten Kansas with their ground game as well if they just featured a quarterback that hadn't been lobotomized.

#### _Weather_

Lovely day to play some football

***

Panthers +10.5

***

**Carolina covers if**  
the Panthers handily win time of possession.

**Kansas City covers if**  
Time of possession is more equitably split between the two teams.
