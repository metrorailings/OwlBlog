+++
My picks last week were trending up. Three of my picks were just money. A fourth pick was a close loss. The last pick (Tennessee) ended up being embarrassingly wrong. Goddamn Titans...the one week they decide to take a break.

If there was a lesson to be learned last week, it's that teams do tend to relax at certain points on their schedule. Identifying these low points in their schedule could bring home some lovely moneybags.

### Saints @ Buccaneers (-4.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Buccaneers** (25) @ Giants (23)  
**Saints** (26) @ Bears (23)

#### _Record_

Saints (5-2)  
Buccaneers (6-2)

#### _Injuries_

The Saints find themselves worrying about their quarterback. Brees has been listed on the injury report this week with a right shoulder injury. That's also his throwing shoulder. Brees has been playing soft as is, refusing to throw the ball down the field. An injury won't be helping his cause.

For the Bucs, a few key piece of their offense are banged up, notably Chris Godwin and Scotty Miller. It's possible Godwin will be sidelined for the game.

#### _History_

The game earlier in the season is irrelevant here. Even though the Saints dominated their home opener, it was Brady's first game with Tampa Bay. It was clear Tom wasn't ready to marshal an offense very different from the one he ran in New England for the past two decades. On top of that, Gronk was still hungover from a year's worth of partying.

It took a few weeks, but Brady, Gronkowski, and the rest of the Buccaneers have now finally gelled into a cohesive unit. The Saints defense will be facing a very different squad from the one they faced in that first week of the season.

#### _Weather_

A lovely 70-degree night, albeit with winds over 20 miles.

***

Buccaneers -3

***

**Tampa Bay covers if**  
their defense (in recognizing this game is critical towards winning the division) manages to limit Kamara's production. It would also help if Antonio Brown's debut as a Buccaneer excites this offense into running up the score.

**New Orleans covers if**  
Alvin Kamara goes off and Drew Brees is solid on short and intermediate passes despite his bum shoulder.

***

### Texans @ Jaguars (+7)

***

#### _Latest Results_

BYE - **Packers** (35) @ Texans (20)  
BYE - Jaguars (29) @ **Chargers** (39)

#### _Record_

Texans (1-6)  
Jaguars (1-6)

#### _Injuries_

With Gardner Minshew recovering from a serious thumb injury, late round rookie Jake Luton will be taking over at the helm of the offense.

On the other side, Houston will be missing the services of their starting linebackers this Sunday due to possible COVID exposure. Benardrick McKinney is also out due to injury.

#### _History_

The Jaguars and Texans met earlier this year. Jacksonville honestly didn't play all too shabby either - Houston only covered thanks to two turnovers, one by downs and one by fumble.

One note of caution though - that game featured Gardner Minshew as Jacksonville's quarterback.

#### _Weather_

Balmy with some considerable humidity.

***

Jaguars +7

***

**Jacksonville covers if**  
The Texans underestimate Jake Luton and allow him to connect on some deep throws. The Jaguars also need to play better defensively this time around - Josh Allen's presence in this game should be a boon in that regard given that he was absent from their first meeting.

**Houston covers if**  
Jake Luton turns out to be an absolute bust in his first NFL outing.

### Panthers @ Chiefs (-10.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Falcons** (25) @ Panthers (17)  
Jets (9) @ **Chiefs** (35)

#### _Record_

Panthers (3-5)  
Chiefs (7-1)

#### _Injuries_

Carolina may be missing their best defensive back in rookie safety Jeremy Chinn. Not a good thing considering Carolina's secondary is generally seen as their biggest weakness.

The Chiefs will likely be missing their right tackle Mitchell Schwartz.

#### _History_

Arguably, the Panthers have yet to face a truly explosive offense this year. Still, they've faced teams that relied on man coverage, and the results have been iffy to say the least. Chicago was able to stifle their short routes with man coverage.

Kansas City hasn't fared well against teams that run the ball well either. Las Vegas handed them their only loss largely because the Raiders were able to control time of possession with their ground game. It could be argued New England could have beaten Kansas with their ground game as well if they just featured a quarterback that hadn't been lobotomized.

#### _Weather_

Lovely day to play some football

***

Panthers +10.5

***

**Carolina covers if**  
the Panthers handily win time of possession.

**Kansas City covers if**  
Time of possession is more equitably split between the two teams.

***

### Raiders @ Chargers (PK)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Raiders** (16) @ Browns (6)  
Chargers (30) @ **Broncos** (31)

#### _Record_

Raiders (4-3)  
Chargers (2-5)

#### _Injuries_

For the Raiders, multiple offensive linemen are banged up. Both starting tackles right now remain questionable to play. Just as worrisome, Josh Jacobs has been dealing with multiple issues this week, so his durability needs to be questioned as well.

The Chargers are down their best defensive player in Joey Bosa. Casey Heyward may be out too, for reasons unknown.   

#### _History_

The Chargers and the Raiders will be facing each other for the first time this year. Last year's games between these two only carry so much relevance, as Philip Rivers was the starting quarterback for Los Angeles. 

#### _Weather_

Not applicable, as it's a dome game

***

Raiders PK

***

**Las Vegas covers if**  
Time of possession is sharply in their favor yet again.

**Los Angeles covers if**  
Justin Herbert has more than enough opportunities to score against a shoddy Raiders defense. It would also help tremendously if the Chargers played to win instead of playing not to lose.

***

### Ravens @ Colts (+2.5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

**Steelers** (28) @ Ravens (24)  
**Colts** (41) @ Lions (21)

#### _Record_

Ravens (5-2)  
Colts (5-2)

#### _Injuries_

The Ravens are dangerously thin on the secondary as long as Marlon Humphrey and Jimmy Smith are out. Not to mention their offense sustained a heavy blow with the season-ending injury to Ronnie Stanley. The mental strength of this Baltimore squad will be tested on the road.

For the Colts, we have two notable injuries, Mo-Alie Cox and T.Y. Hilton. Honestly, Mo-Alie Cox is a bigger hit to this team than Hilton. Indianapolis's offense runs so much more through their tight ends and tailbacks than their wide receivers.

#### _History_

The Ravens have beaten up on a bunch of lightweights this season, so comparables will be hard to find. Same with Indianapolis. The Colts haven't faced a team that blitzes above 30% of their defensive snaps (besides the Jets, who don't count).

#### _Weather_

Not applicable, as it's a dome game.

***

Ravens -2.5

***

**Baltimore covers if**  
Indianapolis is not prepared enough to deal with the myriad of ways the Ravens love to pressure the quarterback. A possibility, given Indianapolis is also preparing for another game in a few days that may determine control of the division.

**Indianapolis covers if**  
Lamar folds yet again, as he has a habit of doing against really good teams. 

***

### Dolphins @ Cardinals (-5)

***

#### _Latest Results_

Rams (17) @ **Dolphins** (28)  
BYE - Seahawks (34) @ **Cardinals** (37)

#### _Record_

Dolphins (4-3)  
Cardinals (5-2)

#### _Injuries_

The Dolphins will be without their two preferred options at tailback. The disappointing Jordan Howard will be starting instead at halfback. Otherwise, the rest of the team will be present, though the defense is nicked up.

Arizona's biggest injury is arguably to Budda Baker. Budda Baker went through thumb surgery just recently, so while he's still expected to play, his efficacy on the field may be limited.

#### _History_

Arizona hasn't faced a truly dominant passing defense. Meanwhile, Miami's history only means so much here given that it's only Tua's second start in the professional leagues.

#### _Weather_

Not applicable, as it's in a dome.

***

Cardinals -5

***

**Arizona covers if**  
the Cardinals and their blitz packages gives Tua hell in his first road start.

**Miami covers if**  
the Dolphins are able to muster just enough of a rushing game with Jordan Howard and the defense plays sensationally against an offense that loves to send its quarterback out on option runs in spread formation.
