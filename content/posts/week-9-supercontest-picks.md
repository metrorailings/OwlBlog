##### Texans @ _Jaguars_ (+1)

I have faith in Gardner Minshew and the Jaguars offense finding some success here in their second home against a Texans defense missing its best playmaker in J.J. Watt.

I am worried about the Jaguars and their porous zone defense here. Their soft coverage schemes can be picked apart by good quarterbacks.
