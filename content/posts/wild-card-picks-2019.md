## Bills @ Texans (-2.5)

The Texans have the experience and the quarterback while the Bills have the better defense overall and the grit. It's a fair spread, to be honest. I'd give the edge to the Texans given it is their home field.

## Titans @ Patriots (-5)

Yes, the Titans have been playing phenomenally with Ryan Tannehill at the helm.
