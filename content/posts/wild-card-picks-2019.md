## Bills @ Texans (-2.5)

The Texans have the experience and the quarterback while the Bills have the better defense overall and the grit. It's a fair spread, to be honest. I'd give the edge to the Texans given it is their home field.

## Titans @ Patriots (-5)

Yes, the Titans have been playing phenomenally with Ryan Tannehill at the helm. But the Titans may have the worst defense this year compared to all the other postseason teams. That and Ryan Tannehill lacks serious playoff experience, making things even more stressful on a Tennessee offense that will be asked to carry the bulk of the workload here in their games.

The Patriots offense has been pretty pathetic this year, but all the other aspects of their team are solid. Their coaches still remain the best in the league as well. Add in home field advantage and you have the recipe for a beatdown here.
