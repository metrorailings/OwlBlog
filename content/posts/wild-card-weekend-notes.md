This shit just don't make no sense. It really doesn't.

## Titans @ Patriots

It seems Tennessee's success on defense came mostly against short-yardage situations and trick plays. The Titans knew the Patriots playbook on those plays - Vrabel leveraged the knowledge he had of New England's habits in these scenarios. Perhaps it's no wonder that Belichick has such a poor record against his assistant coaches compared to his overall record - these coaches know his habits and thought process and know the proper plays to counter them.

If I knew this better, I would have classified the Titans as defensively chess-minded for this game. And that designation would have been enough for me to think twice about taking a side on this game.

And I will never understand why the Patriots were so intent on shutting down the Titans air game early on, despite Ryan Tannehill having a documented history of failure at Gillette Stadium. Derrick Henry is the heart and soul of the offense too - shutting him down early would have forced the Titans to play out of their groove. Steve and Bill Belichick have disappointed me.

## Vikings @ Saints

It seems evident to me that the Saints phoned this game in. Even though pound-for-pound the Saints are the better team, New Orleans was not fully committed to winning this game, instead possibly looking ahead to the Packers or even the 49ers.

Tackling was poor. The pass rush was nonexistent. Will Lutz missed a kick. Offensive linemen were losing their battles in the trenches. Only Trey Hendricksen and and Taysom Hill seem to have shown up here.

Kevin Stefanski needs to be given credit here though for his playcalling. His plays have made some excellent use of pre-snap motion to throw this Saints defense off their scent. The Vikings also used the Saints initial reads against them on occasion with some great success.

Drew Brees is not an elite quarterback. His arm strength has waned with age. Even if the mind and improvisational skill is there, the physical tools are limited.

It's worth noting that Kirk Cousins is playing fairly decent. While his accuracy has presented issues on a few occasions, he's been all right. His ability to pass and roll out to the left has held up excellently into the postseason.
