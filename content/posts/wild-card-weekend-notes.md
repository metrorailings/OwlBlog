This shit just don't make no sense. It really doesn't.

## Titans @ Patriots

It seems Tennessee's success on defense came mostly against short-yardage situations and trick plays. The Titans knew the Patriots playbook on those plays - Vrabel leveraged the knowledge he had of New England's habits in these scenarios. Perhaps it's no wonder that Belichick has such a poor record against his assistant coaches compared to his overall record - these coaches know his habits and thought process and know the proper plays to counter them.

If I knew this better, I would have classified the Titans as defensively chess-minded for this game. And that designation would have been enough for me to think twice about taking a side on this game.

And I will never understand why the Patriots were so intent on shutting down the Titans air game early on, despite Ryan Tannehill having a documented history of failure at Gillette Stadium. Derrick Henry is the heart and soul of the offense too - shutting him down early would have forced the Titans to play out of their groove. Steve and Bill Belichick have disappointed me.
