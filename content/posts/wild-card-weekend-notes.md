This shit just don't make no sense. It really doesn't.

## Titans @ Patriots

It seems Tennessee's success on defense came mostly on short-yardage situations. The Titans knew the Patriots playbook on those plays - Vrabel leveraged the knowledge he had of New England's habits in these scenarios. Perhaps it's no wonder that Belichick has such a poor record against his assistant coaches compared to his overall record - these coaches know his habits and thought process and know the proper plays to counter them.
