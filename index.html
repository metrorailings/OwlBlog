	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Team Assessment Rubric</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			So in assessing these teams and figuring out which teams are more likely to perform well compared to others, I need to come up with some sort of guide that can help me compare these clubs against one another. Yes I know that any one model will fail to grasp all the finer details of the game that motivate the final result, but I do genuinely feel that a great model can be right so much more often than wrong, especially in the playoffs when seasonal data points are pretty much stable at the point. The goal here is to be predict the straight results for at least 8 of the 11 playoff games.</p>

			<h2 id="49ers-seahawks">49ers @ Seahawks</h2>

<p>On the first drive, the 49ers defensive line won all their battles at the line of scrimmage. Arik Armstead and Nick Bosa have been impressive in particular.</p>

<p>The 49ers have some fantastic options on offense. George Kettle, Deebo Samuel, Emmanuel Sanders, Kyle Juscyzk, Raheem Mostert, and Matt Breida are all dependable vectors on offense.</p>

<p>More aggressive press coverage being played by the 49ers against these Seahawks. Impressive.</p>

<p>Some brilliant play from Russell Wilson on the Seahawks first scoring drive.</p>

<p>Arik Armstead impressing here, even though Nick Bosa is clearly the best down lineman on San Francisco.</p>

<p>Seahawks offense is doing so much better in the second half, largely because Russell Wilson is now throwing the ball to the right route-runners depending on whether the 49ers are in man coverage or zone coverage. It seems the 49ers are not really disguising their coverages too much in the second half. Once again speaks to Robert Saleh being an otherwise unremarkable defensive coach lucky to be working with so much talent.</p>

<p>DK Metcalf is truly a reliable vector on Seattle&rsquo;s offense.</p>

			<h2 id="texans-buccaneers">Texans @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Jameis getting steadily better, though his turnover rate is still ridiculous.</p>

<p>Texans still have no viable pass rush without JJ Watt.</p>

<p>Houston actually has some quality pass coverage personnel, though this is Jameis we&rsquo;re talking about. Let&rsquo;s see how they perform against actual competition come playoff time.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-patriots">Bills @ Patriots</h2>

<p>Bills are being gashed on the ground for steady yardage.</p>

<p>Some creative play-calling by the Patriots offense, throwing a ball to N&rsquo;Keal Harry running a wheel route after play action.</p>

<p>Patriots making hay with heavy run formations here peppered with passes here and there. Good play-calling by Josh McDaniels.</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy only down lineman on either team having any impact on this game, even if only on one play.</p>

<p>Dont&rsquo;a Hightower managed to create pressure on a 3rd down.</p>

<p>Bills still insisting on singular man coverage on Julian Edelman.</p>

<p>I notice the Patriots chipping one of the Bills defensive lineman. Probably Shaq Lawson? Jerry Hughes?</p>

<p>Jordan Phillips creating a negative play for the Bills here with a run stuff.</p>

<p>Jerry Hughes and Dont&rsquo;a Hightower stepping up in their pass rush.</p>

<p>Bills are finally stopping Patriot drives now that they&rsquo;re occasionally doubling Julian Edelman.</p>

<p>Patriot insisted on running man coverage, even on an end-of-half drive. That insistence cost them a touchdown.</p>

<p>Lots of double-clutching by Josh Allen. Seems to indicate uncertainty and a failure to read the coverage properly.</p>

<p>Shaq Lawson made solid reads on 2 of the Patriots misdirection plays, stopping these plays early in the backfield.</p>

<p>Bills have some serious issues overall with tackling.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="steelers-jets">Steelers @ Jets</h2>

<p>Holy hell, Mason Rudolph is back at quarterback. Duck Hodges may have been benched. Lord help us.</p>

<p>Gregg Williams&rsquo; zone blitzes making mincemeat of these Steelers quarterbacks.</p>

<p>Boswell is still kicking well.</p>

<p>Ah, Steelers running prevent zone at the end of the half. Fantastic&hellip;.</p>

<p>TJ Watt&rsquo;s huge strip sack leading to a touchdown for the Steelers on a bomb from Mason Rudolph. Not bad.</p>

<p>I think Williams defensive style is the real winner here. Jamal Adams being back also helped. But the Steelers offense was absolutely gutted here by the Jets and their confusing formations. Veteran quarterbacks can dissect the offense, but young inexperienced quarterbacks are left hapless.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-titans">Saints @ Titans</h2>

<p>Titans still commit hard to their play-action heavy offense, even without their bellcow in Derrick Henry. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, as defenses still bite against the fake rush and Tannehill is still doing a fantastic job connecting with his skill players. I honestly wonder if Tannehill can be considered elite.</p>

<p>The Saints and Sean Payton finding ways to get Michael Thomas matched up in single coverage&hellip;.well done.</p>

<p>A zone blitz using the man cornerback covering Michael Thomas was an ill-advised move.</p>

<p>Excellent improvisational play from Ryan Tannehill to create a touchdown from a busted screen play.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-vikings">Packers @ Vikings</h2>

<p>Cousins not doing well enough in a big moment here. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Vikings aren&rsquo;t running as much play action here, forcing Cousins to play dropback football here.</p>

<p>Danielle Hunter is easily the Vikings best defensive lineman. And on the other side, we have Za&rsquo;Darius Smith as the Packers best down lineman.</p>

<p>Aaron Rodgers seems to only really connect with DaVonte Adams and Allen Lazard, at least so far.</p>

<p>A second quarter Packers drive summed up their offense quite well. Quick throws to Davante Adams paired with runs by Jamal Adams and not much else. Aaron Rodgers failed to improvise on two separate opportunities in the red zone, once again making me wonder whether Rodgers can be considered an elite quarterback this season.</p>

<p>Allen Lazard failed to reel in a big throw. Disappointing.</p>

<p>Just questionable play-calling by the Vikings offensive coaches. A failed trick play on 3rd down only to be followed by a weak play on 4th down where receivers ran what are essentially isolation routes. I have yet to really see Cousins fake the hand-off, bootleg out to his left, and deliver a dime.</p>

<p>Dean Lowry beasting against the Vikings and their rushing attack.</p>

<p>This Vikings offensive line is just trash. More specifically, it&rsquo;s the interior that&rsquo;s awful.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-seahawks">Cardinals @ Seahawks</h2>

<p>Rasheem Greene another name to watch on this Seahawks defensive line.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-eagles">Cowboys @ Eagles</h2>

<p>Carson Wentz and his mobility has sustained a few drives.</p>

<p>Greg Ward emerging as a reliable vector on offense.</p>

<p>Dallas Goedert stepping up as a viable catching option.</p>

<p>Brandon Graham playing well as a down lineman on two plays, one a rushing play and the other a passing attempt.</p>

<p>Wentz missing a screen pass that could have closed the game. Worrisome.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, despite the season-ending injuries to their two premiere wide receivers, the Eagles may actually have five different vectors on offense - Miles Sanders as a well-rounded halfback, Dallas Goedert and Zach Ertz as versatile tight ends, Greg Ward as a receiving threat, and Wentz as an effective scrambler.</p>

<p>And yet, Philadelphia still struggles on offense. I&rsquo;m starting to genuinely think that the Eagles coaching staff on offense is not quite as competent as I once thought. Honestly, Frank Reich deserves way more credit for that incredible Super Bowl run a couple years ago.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chiefs-bears">Chiefs @ Bears</h2>

<p>Tyreek Hill is the team&rsquo;s best receiver, though Travis Kelce is a very close second. The real question here for the Chiefs offense is whether they have a reliable third vector on offense. It could be the quarterback&rsquo;s mobility, it could be Shady and the run game, or it could be a second X receiver like Sammy Watkins.</p>

<p>The Chiefs have some of the best route concepts I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>

			<h2 id="buccaneers-lions">Buccaneers @ Lions</h2>

<p>Josh Wells a liability as a replacement left tackle for Tampa Bay.</p>

<p>Detroit Lions actually blitzed for once and managed to secure an interception off that blitz.</p>

<p>The Lions are so bad in their defensive backfield, I love it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bears-packers">Bears @ Packers</h2>

<p>The Packers truly have one of the best offensive lines in the league. Their pass-blocking and run-blocking has been stellar this week and last week.</p>

<p>Great throw by Aaron Rodgers for the team&rsquo;s first touchdown, though the jury is still out on whether he can still be considered an elite quarterback this season.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="seahawks-panthers">Seahawks @ Panthers</h2>

<p>The Seahawks game plan is fairly simple here. Power runs with bootleg play-fakes peppered into the offense every now and then.</p>

<p>But the Panthers are playing the run fairly well. Maybe yet more proof that it&rsquo;s easier for a bad defense to guard against good rushers than it is for a good offense to rush the ball against a bad defense.</p>

<p>These Seahawks skill players seem a tad bit slow. Even Tyler Lockett, who made a great move to shake off a trailing defender, only to be stopped just a few yards later.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-cowboys">Rams @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>Of course the Cowboys are developing a rhythm on offense, courtesy of their offensive line dominating the Rams defensive front in the ground game. The Rams are having a real hard time bringing Elliott down quickly.</p>

<p>Aaron Donald may be the only elite defensive linemen on the Rams, considering none of the other lineman are having much of an impact at defensing the run.</p>

<p>Maybe the lesson here is that the Rams play abnormally well against division opponents. Their true worth can only be measured against teams they do not play often.</p>

<p>Once again, Goff is trash playing dropback football. The Rams need him to settle into a rhythm for the offense to see any success.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-steelers">Bills @ Steelers</h2>

<p>Josh Allen loves holding his balls.</p>

<p>Bold coaching by Sean McDermott paying off with a touchdown.</p>

<p>Nobody on the Bills defensive line really standing out, though Shaq Lawson looks to have potential.</p>

<p>McDermott loves checking out pre-snap formations and then taking timeouts, if only to gain even more intel on the opponent.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-chargers">Vikings @ Chargers</h2>

<p>Danielle Hunter is truly an elite defensive linemen. I still need time to assess whether Linval Joseph or Everson Griffen belong in the same club though. Next week&rsquo;s match against the division leader Packers will be instructive in this regard.</p>

<p>The Vikings on offense thrive off the rushing threat posed by Dalvin Cook. Lots of 12-personnel alignments to draw opposing defenders towards the line of scrimmage. I suspect a simple box count more often than not determines whether Kirk Cousins rolls out for play-action or hands the ball off to Dalvin Cook so he can work his way north.</p>

<p>The true test for Kirk Cousins comes when Dalvin Cook cannot be counted on anymore due to injury. I wonder how he holds up. More research is needed here.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="colts-saints">Colts @ Saints</h2>

<p>Once again the Saints letting up yardage on intermediate and deep crossers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-titans">Texans @ Titans</h2>

<p>The Texans pass coverage has taken a serious step up from its dreadful preseason form.</p>

<p>Interesting power running from the Titans. Their receivers sometimes line up next to the offensive line in a no-point stance only to end up blocking for Derrick Henry right alongside the rest of the offensive line.</p>

<p>The Titans power running is something impressive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="patriots-bengals">Patriots @ Bengals</h2>

<p>New England is making hay here early using rub routes.</p>

<p>This Bengals defense making silly mistakes in coverage. Why are you playing off coverage on N&rsquo;Keal Harry, of all people?</p>

<p>Now that Cincinnati started playing more aggressive man coverage, New England&rsquo;s depth receivers are struggling to matriculate the ball downfield.</p>

<p>The right side of New England&rsquo;s offensive line is struggling to hold up in pass protection, it seems.  Is this an exception to the rule?</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy is definitely the team&rsquo;s best pass rusher, but Deatrich Wise looks to have serious potential here.</p>

			<h4 id="buccaneers-lions-3"><em>Buccaneers</em> @ Lions (+3)</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to trust Jameis here, especially given that he&rsquo;s without his favorite weapon in Mike Evans. Still, Jameis did all right last week when Evans had to leave early.  Things would have been much better if he didn&rsquo;t throw three ugly interceptions against the Colts and their zone defense.</p>

<p>It helps that the Lions almost exclusively play man coverage here, as it limits opportunities for interceptions. And even if interceptions are made, return yardage will be kept to a minimum.</p>

<p>If Jameis has enough opportunities, he&rsquo;ll sling the ball all over this Lions defense and secure a good win here.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="texans-titans-3"><em>Texans</em> @ Titans (-3)</h4>

<p>The Titans have been rolling lately, whereas the Texans lost ugly to a Denver team starting a rookie quarterback. But that&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;rookie quarterbacks have the surprise factor going for them in that there&rsquo;s so little footage on them. That and the Broncos have a solid cast of playmakers on offense that a young quarterback can rely on for help.</p>

<p>Then again, does it even matter? O&rsquo;Brien just had one of the biggest wins in his career. Could he really bring himself to give a damn about a team that was more than a touchdown underdog? Doubtful. So mix this apathy from the Texans coaching staff with the uncertainty that comes when a rookie quarterback starts games and you had the recipe for a sick upset.</p>

<p>In other words, the Texans are nowhere near as bad as their loss last week. Houston can still throw and run the ball fairly well. And both of those will help keep them in contention here against a Titans defense that&rsquo;s more middling than I originally thought.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="seahawks-panthers-6-5"><em>Seahawks</em> @ Panthers (+6.5)</h4>

<p>The Panthers suck. The Seahawks need a win. And this game seems like Michael Lombardi&rsquo;s favorite play this week.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="rams-cowboys-1"><em>Rams</em> @ Cowboys (+1)</h4>

<p>It scares me that so many people are riding the Rams here. But a soft forensic analysis justifies my love for the Rams here. Give me a good team as slight favorites against another team that&rsquo;s been underwhelming the past few weeks.</p>

<p>Can the Cowboys win? Yes they can. It&rsquo;s going to take some solid coaching and inspiration though. Having gotten to know Jason Garrett over the past couple years though, I&rsquo;m pretty comfortable betting against him.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="colts-saints-8"><em>Colts</em> @ Saints (-8)</h4>

<p>Way too many points being given to a good team here. Yes, the Colts are not great, but they&rsquo;re not bad enough to justify this spread, even with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback. I&rsquo;m hoping Frank Reich&rsquo;s offensive genius can find a way to simulate some of the success the 49ers saw last week on offense.</p>

			<h2 id="49ers-saints">49ers @ Saints</h2>

<p>As expected, the Saints are working the 49ers in the short game, as the Cardinals did not too long ago.</p>

<p>Absence of Jaquiski Tartt at deep safety made a difference on an intermediate throw to Jared Cook for a touchdown.</p>

<p>49ers picking on Eli Apple on three consecutive downs for big plays. Eli Apple seems to have a hard time guarding the slant.</p>

<p>49ers coming into this game well-coached and ready, given the success of their first drive.</p>

<p>Nick Bosa having an impact on this game, stunting the Saints on two downs.</p>

<p>Deonte Harris making his presence known as a speedster on offense.</p>

<p>49ers pass protection is holding up. Although it does help that the Saints are biting hard on play-action. New Orleans needs to play more assignments on defense. Kudos to Kyle Shanahan for outcoaching Dennis Allen though.</p>

<p>Good play-calling by Sean Payton right near the goal line. Called a power run on 3rd down that set up an easy quarterback sneak on 4th down.</p>

<p>The Saints defensive line are not winning upfront. Shanahan is punking this defense.</p>

<p>49ers seem to have three solid skill players on offense - Deebo Samuel, Emmanuel Sanders, and George Kittle. Also helps that the team can run the ball with a combination of different halfbacks. And unlike Kyle Shanahan&rsquo;s Falcons the year they went to the Super Bowl, this team may have multiple pass rushers worth a damn.</p>

<p>Nick Bosa can be designated an elite pass rusher. Nobody else has really impressed me as of yet on this 49er defensive front.</p>

<p>New Orleans doesn&rsquo;t have much of a pass rush in this game. Cameron Jordan may be the only elite pass rusher on that defense.</p>

<p>I wonder if New Orleans has a tendency to play their cornerbacks more in outside technique. If so, it makes their linebackers all the more valuable, as that unit is essentially the first line of defense against crossing routes. It would explain how Jared Goff had a hell of a game against these Saints last year.</p>

<p>Then again, the corners may be playing outside technique as they&rsquo;re counting on the safeties to defend the real dangerous crossing routes. And these Saint safeties are just awful.</p>

<p>Kyle Shanahan is playing this Saints defense like a fiddle, even predicting when New Orleans will run man coverage.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chiefs-patriots">Chiefs @ Patriots</h2>

<p>Trick play by the Patriots for a touchdown - a sliding flea flicker. Well done by Josh McDaniels. Brady&rsquo;s pass was a bit underthrown too. Makes me wonder&hellip;</p>

<p>Chris Jones already working the interior of the Patriots offensive line. Him putting the heat on Brady ended a Patriots drive coming off a turnover.</p>

<p>Once again, Brady underthrowing yet another pass that might have put New England in fringe field-goal range.</p>

<p>Patriots pass rush is anemic. If New England wins, they may be able to thank Mahomes untimely hand injury for the cheap victory.</p>

<p>Patriots struggling to run this ball. Their success has largely come courtesy of the pass.</p>

<p>Brady showing his age. A bad decision (abetted a bit by pressure) led to an interception deep on the Patriots side of the field.</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy making plays against the run, as an elite defender should.</p>

<p>Brady&rsquo;s depth receivers are letting him down. That and Kansas City has found a solution here on defense, blitzing an overmatched offensive line. Combine that with a lack of a run game and it makes things almost impossible for New England here.</p>

<p>You take away Edelman and James White, you&rsquo;re left with a dysfunctional Patriots offense. Belichick and Brady poured their hearts into this game and still lost.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ravens-bills">Ravens @ Bills</h2>

<p>Ravens start their first drive executing mostly pass plays. Interesting. Let&rsquo;s see if they still insist on Lamar heaving the ball against the Bills elite pass defense.</p>

<p>Their second drive was run-heavy. Coincidentally, the Ravens were able to post their first points on the board at the end of the drive.</p>

<p>Once again, an exotic run play leads to a touchdown for this Ravens offense. This Bills defense showing spunk though.</p>

<p>Bills did mostly well defensing the run. It was the Ravens and their blitzes that threw this Buffalo offense out of its groove until the game was too out of hand. Ravens were almost too happy blitzing, almost as if they weren&rsquo;t worried about Josh Allen being able to dissect their undermanned pass coverage.</p>

<p>Ravens man coverage defenders did incredibly well guarding against Buffalo&rsquo;s smaller and more agile receiver unit. That&rsquo;s two weeks in a row now that the Ravens defensive backfield held up against a receiver corps known more for speed than size.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="redskins-packers">Redskins @ Packers</h2>

<p>I honestly wonder whether it&rsquo;s easier stopping an offense that can rush the ball well or running against a defense that struggles to neutralize the ground game.</p>

<p>Dear lord&hellip;Haskins is just awful.</p>

<p>Aaron Jones is something special when he accelerates into the second level. And it&rsquo;s quite impressive to see Green Bay just lining up in power run formations and pound the ball for big yardage.</p>

<p>The Smith brothers can both be considered elite pass rushers so far. Za&rsquo;Darius is clearly the better half in the duo though. The Redskins were finally making hay through power runs until Za&rsquo;Darius finally forced a negative play by shooting through an interior gap. It didn&rsquo;t matter though as Dwayne Haskins was able to convert on a 3rd and long.</p>

<p>Lazard making a big catch to keep the chains moving for the Packers offense.</p>

<p>Washington is just injured. Quarterback is operating on one leg, their best pass rusher is dealing with a leg injury, and their best halfback has been ruled out in the first half with a knee injury.</p>

<p>Aaron Rodgers is seriously struggling to find open receivers, despite having several seconds in the pocket on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>Yes, it is easier to defend a good rushing team than to rush the ball against a bad team. All a defense needs to do to stop the run is to put more men in the box. I wish I knew this for the Patriots game.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="steelers-cardinals">Steelers @ Cardinals</h2>

<p>Steeler fans travel well.</p>

<p>Why is Kyler playing so scared? Kliff should be scheming these quick plays better.</p>

<p>I have to say&hellip;Kyler may be shitting himself here. I wonder if being hit by NFL linemen is taking its toll on him mentally.</p>

<p>Better play from Kyler following a Pittsburgh turnover. Though any success I saw on that drive came more from scheme than quarterback play. Still, the Steelers defense are doing a solid job limiting Kyler Murray&rsquo;s options here. Even when Kyler attempted to run the ball outside, Minkah Fitzpatrick immediately cut him off.</p>

<p>Finally, the up-tempo play-calling is yielding results for this Arizona offense. Steelers are trying their damnedest to confuse Kyler by crowding the line of scrimmage with linebackers though.</p>

<p>Duck Hodges making hay with scramble runs.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-raiders">Titans @ Raiders</h2>

<p>Raiders are dismal against the pass.</p>

<p>Ryan Tannehill really impressing in a bit of a tough situation here, delivering on a touchdown bomb while under severe duress.</p>

<p>Raiders can run the ball with backs other than Josh Jacobs.</p>

<p>Oakland committing to stopping the run, lining up quite a bit in their 4-3 base defense.</p>

<p>Likewise, Tennessee looking to cut the Raiders off on their short yardage plays. The Titans defensive backs overplayed the flat on one play, giving up an easy touchdown heave.</p>

<p>Oakland may have some of the worst defensive backs in the league.</p>

<p>Tennessee may have issues of their own as well in their defensive backfield.</p>

<p>Titans play pretty intelligently on defense.</p>

<p>Tennessee&rsquo;s offense has some character to it. Hurrying the pace at the correct moments, calling semi-trick plays towards the end of the game to close things out&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="seahawks-rams">Seahawks @ Rams</h2>

<p>Seahawks and Rams know each other a little too well.</p>

<p>On one play, the Seahawks tried to bait Jared Goff into throwing a wide receiver screen in a situation that seemingly favored such a screen. The Rams anticipated this, as one of the skill players that the Seahawks presumed would be blocking ended up releasing and running a fly and catching a big throw to set LA up for a touchdown.</p>

<p>Likewise on defense, the Rams still kept seven men in the box even though the Seahawks spread four receivers out. The Rams were correct to do so though, as the Hawks ended up running the ball.</p>

<p>If Goff can be scripted into rhythm, this Rams offense looks so much better.  While Goff might not be worth much as a dropback passer, he can certainly execute on scheme.</p>

<p>Two errors killed a Seahawks drive.</p>

			<h4 id="ravens-bills-5-5"><em>Ravens</em> @ Bills (+5.5)</h4>

<p>The Bills&rsquo; big win against Dallas may have been overblown, given Chicago&rsquo;s manhandling of the Cowboys last night.</p>

<p>But more important than that, the Bills still have a major problem guarding against the run. While they&rsquo;ve improved a little over the past few weeks, it&rsquo;s a problem that&rsquo;s going to linger for the whole season. And that weakness will be exposed in the worst possible way against a Ravens team that can run the ball a myriad of ways.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="49ers-saints-2-5">49ers @ <em>Saints</em> (-2.5)</h4>

<p>The 49ers and their defensive line concern me a bit, especially given the injuries along the Saints offensive front. Still though&hellip;from what I saw when the Cardinals played San Francisco twice this season, this 49ers defense can be picked apart with short passes and some creative play calling.  Fortunately for the home team here, short passes and imaginative plays are the two central pillars of their offense.</p>

<p>So long as Brees can rid himself of the ball before the 49ers pass rushers start invading his personal space, New Orleans has a good shot at the cover here.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="chiefs-patriots-3">Chiefs @ <em>Patriots</em> (-3)</h4>

<p>The Patriots looked horrendous last week in their loss against the Texans. And it&rsquo;s hard for me to envision somebody like Bill Belichick tolerating yet another bad performance from his team this week.</p>

<p>Still, even a good day on offense for these Patriots wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to secure them the win here and the possible cover here. No, what New England needs to do is dominate these Chiefs in the ground game. So long as the Patriots possess the ball here and keep Mahomes snaps to a minimal number, New England can outright win in dominating fashion. And that&rsquo;s possible given Kansas is absolute ass in defensing the run.</p>

<p>And even if the Patriots do give up the ball pretty quickly on a few drives, I would hope New England&rsquo;s solid defensive backfield will be able to stunt the Chiefs and their big play offense on more than just a few occasions.</p>

<h4 id="steelers-cardinals-2-5">Steelers @ <em>Cardinals</em> (+2.5)</h4>

<p>My faith in the Duckster last week paid off. But in the process, I lost some faith in him - his big plays are hit or miss. Thankfully, most of his plays last week were more successful than not. But then again, Pittsburgh had a reason to play ever harder than usual, given the way their first match against Cleveland ended. This week, that same motivation isn&rsquo;t there. And it should make things a tad bit easier for Kyler Murray as he and his Cardinals settle back into the thick of things after an embarrassing loss against the Rams last week.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh&rsquo;s defense does give up pass yardage.  And Arizona can throw the ball if necessary here. In this rebound spot, give me Arizona.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="seahawks-rams-pk"><em>Seahawks</em> @ Rams (PK)</h4>

<p>I do respect the Rams, but give me the MVP-caliber quarterback here over a quarterback way out of his groove this season. Still, it does worry me that the Seahawks defense chokes up lots of yardage to opposing offenses. Out of all my picks, I see this being the riskiest - if Seattle gives the Rams offense enough time to settle into a rhythm, expect a back-and-forth affair here.</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;ll take my chances with Russell Wilson over Jared Goff and a cooling Rams team any day of the week.</p>

			<h4 id="browns-steelers-2">Browns @ <em>Steelers</em> (+2)</h4>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel that the Brownies are walking straight into a trap here. Coming off a big win, facing off against a team that it just dominated a few weeks ago (which is now starting a third-stringer at quarterback, mind you)&hellip;the reasons are there to phone this game in, especially with Freddie Kitchens&rsquo; lackadaisical coaching.</p>

<p>The Steelers, on the other hand, should be hyped for this game. After being bullied by these fools just a few weeks ago, emotions are still very raw. I expect the Steelers&rsquo; defensive front to have a hell of a time shredding through Cleveland&rsquo;s offensive front. And if that holds true, Baker Mayfield will be reduced to mush here. On the other side, Duck Hodges will make just enough plays to &ldquo;upset&rdquo; the Browns here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> I was right enough here. Cleveland was actually pretty successful running and passing the ball in the 2nd quarter, but Pittsburgh&rsquo;s defensive front landed some hits on Baker Mayfield, one of which rendered his hand numb for the second half. Anyway, it was these constant hits that won the game for the Steelers.</p>

<p>Although&hellip;it also helps that the Duckster was able to launch a few deep balls thanks largely to Cleveland&rsquo;s poor pass rush affording him so much time in the pocket.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="redskins-panthers-10">Redskins @ <em>Panthers</em> (-10)</h4>

<p>Should I really pick middling teams as double-digit favorites? I guess we&rsquo;ll find out.</p>

<p>One thing to be said about Washington&hellip;.the Redskins are awful. <em>Just awful</em>. Nothing sums up their commitment to sucking ass better than their rookie quarterback, Dwayne Haskins. If the Panthers can rack up quarterback hits here and force some turnovers, Carolina can cover this spread.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong>  While I haven&rsquo;t seen this game and I doubt I will, I just want to note that the Panthers being unable to stop the only thing the Redskins do somewhat well on offense is disheartening. It&rsquo;s a stark reminder not to bank on middling teams as double-digit favorites.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="49ers-ravens-6"><em>49ers</em> @ Ravens (-6)</h4>

<p>From an Elo standpoint, the Ravens&rsquo; ranking is inflated. After that big win, this spread literally jumped up 2 to 3 points in their favor. A little bit too much of a jump given that the 49ers are one of the three best teams in this league. Their defense can certainly limit Lamar Jackson&rsquo;s production here.</p>

<p>The real question here is whether the 49ers can post points against a Ravens defense that has stepped up quite a bit over the past few weeks. And while I don&rsquo;t have too much faith in Jimmy Garoppalo dropping back with the football, I do trust Kyle Shanahan to find ways to scheme big plays to keep his team in contention.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> The 49ers were able to pull off the cover, thanks to some courageous play and some opportune fumbles. Still, watching the game leaves me wondering whether this was such a solid pick. The Ravens played like the better team in my eyes. San Francisco was unable to goad and harass Lamar as much as I initially assumed. On top of that, the Ravens were constantly making fools out of the front with their trick runs. In the end, I think the weather has as big a role here in my win as the 49ers offense did running the ball for over 150 yards.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="titans-colts-2-5"><em>Titans</em> @ Colts (-2.5)</h4>

<p>Indianapolis has been getting by this season thanks mostly to solid coaching and stellar offensive line play. However, without T.Y. Hilton and Marlon Mack,  the Colts will be relying on Eric Ebron, Jonathan Williams, and Zach Pascal to step up on offense. I&rsquo;m not sure those three are enough to notch points against a respectable Tennessee defense playing better now that a capable quarterback has brought life back into their offense.</p>

<p>If Tennessee can force some ugly throws and movements out of Jacoby Brissett, the cover and upset is pretty much guaranteed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> You know, if the Colts had a competent kicker, a win wouldn&rsquo;t have been too far out of reach though.</p>

<p>But they don&rsquo;t have one. And I knew that before the game. And without their star skill players, Indy&rsquo;s drives tended to end a good bit short of the end zone. It would only be so long before Derrick Henry and Ryan Tannehill would find their sea legs against a Colts defense that was wearing down over the game.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="rams-cardinals-3">Rams @ <em>Cardinals</em> (+3)</h4>

<p>Typically, I shy away from stock low situations, but the Rams are just awful, what with their offensive scheme having been decoded and Jared Goff flailing wildly behind an offensive line not affording him much protection. Los Angeles lost any sort of magic they had last year on offense.</p>

<p>The Cardinals, on the other hand, have been playing better and better with as the season progresses.  Kliff Kingsbury&rsquo;s willingness to modify his air raid strategy has paid off in dividends - Kyler Murray and the offense have been surprisingly productive the last several games. On defense, the team seems to be playing better too, led by their star players in Chandler Jones, Terrell Suggs, Patrick Peterson, and Budda Baker.</p>

<p>Given 3 points here, I&rsquo;ll side with the team showing more promise, even if this smells like a trap line.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> The Cardinals came out of their bye still half-asleep. If you manage a defense ranked near the bottom of the league, you&rsquo;d probably serve your team well spiking their coffees in the mornings following bye week. Instead, Arizona&rsquo;s defense barely showed up here as the Rams posted a record day on offense.</p>

<p>On second thought though, maybe it&rsquo;s not that shocking that Arizona came out so limp in this outing, given Kliff is still learning the ropes as an NFL head coach.</p>
