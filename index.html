	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Buffalo Bills</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Buffalo Bills have fought their way into the playoffs for the second time under Sean McDermott. Now let&rsquo;s review them.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes, the team is mentally tough. They&rsquo;ve done enough to demonstrate a will to fight, winning almost all the games they&rsquo;re supposed to win. Their defense has hung in their in tough moments, defending leads against last-minute comeback attempts.</p>

<p>Even against tough opponents, the Bills have played well too. Baltimore and New England had to scratch and claw their way to wins over this Buffalo squad.</p>

<p>The only knock on this team and their defense is their wretched tackling. The Bills have some serious issues stopping players upon first contact.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes, the team does feature a great defensive mind in Sean McDermott. This team has lifted itself to the playoffs twice under McDermott thanks to the strength of their defense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately not. While most of the starters on offense have considerable playoff experience, this will be Josh Allen&rsquo;s first outing in the postseason. As a mediocre quarterback starting in the playoffs, things won&rsquo;t start well for these Bills.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>No. I would even struggle to say they&rsquo;re led by a viable quarterback. In reality, these Bills are led by an athlete. While Allen can run like a gazelle, he can&rsquo;t throw with any sort of grace or touch.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>To be determined. Brian Daboll has gotten some productivity out of this offense thanks to his usage of short routes, power runs behind Devin Singletary, Josh Allen&rsquo;s mobility, and good usage of mid-level veterans like John Brown and Cole Beasley. But it&rsquo;s difficult separating the logic and philosophy driving this offense from Josh Allen&rsquo;s painful throwing.</p>

<p>It seems that when this season started, the Bills were intent on having Josh Allen work with smaller receivers that could run more complicated routes. And it paid off. So if anything, that&rsquo;s an argument that demonstrates the intelligence of the coaching staff here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>At least one. I can count <strong><em>Shaq Lawson</em></strong> as an elite pass rusher here. Though not league-leading in any respect, the man still makes plays here and there, even if the numbers don&rsquo;t necessarily vouch for his ability.</p>

<p><strong><em>Jerry Hughes</em></strong> is another possibility, given the Patriots seemed intent on doubling him at the line of scrimmage. But that might have been more circumstance than actual strategy on the part of New England.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Bills hit the magic number of 3 here. I can confirm <strong><em>John Brown</em></strong>, <strong><em>Devin Singletary</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Josh Allen</em></strong> as veritable vectors. John Brown is undoubtedly the team&rsquo;s best receiver and the receiver Josh Allen favors most, going by targets. With 2 yards per route run, Brown has validated the team&rsquo;s belief in him. Devin Singletary, meanwhile, has been a great halfback, posting over 5 yards on average with every rush. And Josh Allen is on this list given his mobility - while his passing is suspect, his athleticism and his long runs are truly an asset to the offense.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cole Beasley</em></strong> falls outside this bucket here given that his production hasn&rsquo;t quite cemented him as a cornerstone on this offense. He&rsquo;s come up big in spot moments, so it was a little difficult crossing his name off here, but production and dependence matters here when assessing potential vectors.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>No. Stephen Hauschka has missed quite a few field goals this year from 50 yards and out. In fact, he missed 2 important field goals in the Bills 3-point loss to the Browns. A couple other missed field goals were attempted in end-half scenarios, creating doubts about whether he can be clutch should the Bills need a last-minute field goal to win.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Tre&rsquo; Davious White. One of the best cornerbacks in the game. Enough said.</p>

<p>Micah Hyde is another candidate here.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Bills have a number of deficiencies, most notably at quarterback and kicker. The lack of playoff experience will hurt Buffalo as well in their first match against the Texans.</p>

<p>Still, there&rsquo;s a possibility the Bills can pull off an upset against Houston in the Wild Card round. If so, their season will end in dismal fashion in Baltimore.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Minnesota Vikings</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Using the rubric outlined <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>, it&rsquo;s time for us to start our review of postseason teams with the sixth seed of the NFC, the Minnesota Vikings!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>No. It&rsquo;s hard for me to say this too, as I always respected Mike Zimmer and the defenses that he trains up. His defenses are usually greater than the sum of their parts. But the offense is nowhere near as resilient as the defense. With the exception of the game against the Dallas Cowboys, the Vikings offense hasn&rsquo;t surpassed expectations, nor have they really mounted any successful comebacks against solid teams.</p>

<p>Minnesota had an opportunity to step up its game against the Packers two weeks ago, but the Vikings were even more flaccid on offense than the Packers. It was depressing to see the team fail to come through on such an important game.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes, he is. There&rsquo;s no doubt that Mike Zimmer has a solid understanding of good defense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes. Most of the starters on offense have some playoff experience. Even though Kirk Cousins only has one meaningful postseason game in his career, I&rsquo;ll give him the benefit of the doubt here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>No, even though Kirk Cousins has some gaudy numbers. Those numbers came more from a play-action bootleg concept that Kevin Stefanski and Gary Kubiak incorporated into the offense midway through the season. When Kirk Cousins is forced to drop back and play quarterback without any window dressing, the man tends to fall apart.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>To be determined. As I discussed earlier when explaining why Kirk Cousins is not an elite quarterback, offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski saw some remarkable success when he incorporated a bootleg concept in the offensive playbook, allowing Kirk Cousins to roll out to his left and air out some dimes.</p>

<p>The fact that this team has been pretty productive despite not having an elite quarterback usually stands as proof that the main offensive coaches are doing a great job here, but I wonder if the Vikings&rsquo; success comes more from talent and easy competition than it does from scheme. Not to mention Minnesota remains firmly committed to the outdated mentality of power running setting everything up.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p><em>Danielle Hunter (DE)</em></p>

<p>The only pass rusher I can wholeheartedly define as elite is <strong><em>Danielle Hunter</em></strong>. I&rsquo;ve seen him step up in big moments and he has the pressure numbers and tackle numbers to justify his inclusion. <strong><em>Everson Griffen</em></strong> has those numbers as well. But it&rsquo;s different. I have yet to see Griffin truly step up and make plays on a consistent basis. I&rsquo;ll list him here simply as a possible elite pass rusher.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>I can only confirm two vectors here - <strong><em>Dalvin Cook</em></strong> and <strong><em>Stefon Diggs</em></strong>. The former remains one of the best tailbacks in this league given his penchant for manufacturing yards despite some poor run blocking from his offensive lineman. Stefon Diggs remains one of the best receiving threats in the league, having posted 2.69 yards per route run, according to Pro Football Focus.</p>

<p>It seems unfair not to include <strong><em>Adam Thielan</em></strong> on this list, but his production has plummeted off a click the past several weeks. It remains to be seen whether his injuries continuing plaguing him in the postseason.</p>

<p>Nobody else really qualifies to be on this list, which is a little worrisome. Having only two reliable vectors can leave this offense short-changed against well-coached defenses.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Yes. Outside on one bad game early in the season, Dan Bailey has done well scoring field goals and extra points for his Vikings.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Yes, Harrison Smith has made a name for himself as one of the best swiss-knife safeties in this league.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>This team should be better given its roster. But an injury to a key receiver, a lack of resilience on the part of the offense, iffy offensive coaching, a pedestrian quarterback, and complete lack of home field advantage will doom this team in their first match against the Saints.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Team Assessment Rubric</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>So in assessing these teams and figuring out which teams are more likely to perform well compared to others, I need to come up with some sort of guide that can help me compare these clubs against one another. Yes I know that any one model will fail to grasp all the finer details of the game that motivate the final result, but I do genuinely feel that a great model can be right so much more often than wrong, especially in the playoffs when seasonal data points are pretty much stable at the point. The goal here is to be predict the straight results for at least 8 of the 11 playoff games.</p>

<p>Below, I ask the following questions in <strong>order of importance</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Quite simply put, has the team showed resilience in adverse situations and still managed to play well?  Usually, this trait can be seen whenever a team has to mount a late-game comeback, especially on the road. But this trait can also manifest itself in the face of serious injury across the roster (think of the 2017 Eagles).</p>

<p>This mental fortitude usually comes from a strong head coach fostering a culture of teamwork, honesty, and discipline in the locker room.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Defenses tend to win championships. And a brilliant defensive mind will take you a long way in the playoffs, as he&rsquo;ll be able to diagnose the concepts that guide opposing offenses and structure his defenses accordingly. Few do this better than Bill Belichick.</p>

<p>A good defense is necessary if I am to designate the defensive coordinator or head coach of that team as a chess player. It sounds stupidly obvious, but it&rsquo;s worth noting nonetheless. After all, a good defensive coach should eventually produce a good defense sometime during the course of the regular season, no? However, the inverse is <strong><em>not</em></strong> true - a good defense doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to be led by a good mind. Sometimes, talent is more than enough for a defense to be good. However&hellip;talent without intelligence only leads to squandered potential, especially during the playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>In other words, I&rsquo;m talking about playoff jitters here. Sure, jitters quiet down after one game, but for that one game, nerves can determine whether a team succeeds or fails. We&rsquo;ve seen this happen time and time again, whether it was the Dallas offense starting horribly slow back in 2016, Philadelphia stumbling in its first postseason game in 2017 before rattling off two sensational wins, the Rams constantly fumbling the ball early against the Falcons in 2017, or the Jaguars embarrassing themselves with an ugly win against the lowly Bills before shredding the Steelers defense in their only postseason appearance over the last several years.</p>

<p>While the Eagles and Jaguars were able to overcome their nerves to win their respective games, the Rams and Cowboys were sunk into too deep a hole early because of their jitters.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Pretty straightforward why this is important. In today&rsquo;s pass-happy NFL, you need a quality quarterback that can be productive passing the ball, especially when schemes fail to yield easy yardage.</p>

<p>An elite quarterback is defined as a signal-caller that can throw the ball far more accurately than most other quarterbacks in the league and can still be very effective passing the ball without excessive use of schemes or gimmicks. In other words, an elite quarterback is a passer that can actually play dropback football, in which he&rsquo;s improvising throws based off whatever looks the defense gives him. To be effective at dropback football over the course of a season, one usually has to demonstrate an ability to make plays under heavy duress and against tight coverage.</p>

<p>Take the 2018 Rams and their signal caller, Jared Goff. Even though the Rams were the bad boys of the league that year on offense, Jared Goff was not an elite quarterback - the man was a product of McVay&rsquo;s system. Once that system was decoded towards the end of the season, the team saw a major dip in their production as the offense had to rely more on Jared Goff actually dropping back in the pocket, making reads, and throwing the football accurately. It wasn&rsquo;t a pretty sight, going by the Super Bowl that year.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no stat that blissfully sums this up. All the traditional quarterback stats are meaningless, given that we&rsquo;re trying to isolate quarterback performance from offensive production. The only three measures I could find that might be meaningful towards our aim here is the season-wide Expected Completion Percentage provided by Next Gen Stats, ESPN&rsquo;s proprietary Quarterback Rating, and Pro Football Focus&rsquo;s quarterback grades. The first two are limited to some extent though, especially QBR - ESPN&rsquo;s formula is still something of a black box and has been known to spit out some shady numbers from time to time. Honestly, the gold standard here is probably Pro Football Focus and their play-by-play grading on each and every quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Basically, just copy and paste the same stuff I wrote about teams needing a defensive chess players - does this team feature a great mind on offense, somebody that can scheme up great plays and create easy yardage for their offense? Pair a brilliant mind with an elite quarterback and you have a damn good combination on offense. Josh McDaniels, Frank Reich, and Andy Reid all serve as offensive geniuses on their respective teams.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m still of the belief that the edge rusher is the most important position in football outside of the quarterback, especially during the postseason. More than other positions, it&rsquo;s the edge rushers that sway critical games in their team&rsquo;s favor during the playoffs. It was the Giants and their pass rush that unraveled the seemingly immortal Patriots of 2007. The Giants repeated the same feat in 2011 thanks once again to a dominant pass rush. Hell, it could even be argued that the Patriots of 2018 won their Super Bowl in large part thanks to Trey Flowers and Kyle Van Noy wrecking offensive backfields in playoff games.</p>

<p>A pass rush will never win you the Super Bowl alone. But it certainly helps a great deal, which makes sense - defensive backs and coverage linebackers can only blanket skill players for so long before a receiver finally becomes open. An elite coverage unit is theoretically worthless if opposing quarterbacks can simply sit in the pocket and wait for one of their receivers to finally break free from coverage.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to be considered an elite pass rusher though. To get to this point, the defensive rusher needs to be able to generate pressure against opposing quarterbacks on a consistent basis. Quarterback hits are a pretty accurate metric to use here, though we should also review game tape to determine that whether a player simply feasted on weaker competition or actually managed to rack up some hits against more capable offensive linemen and quarterbacks.</p>

<p>Defensive rushers can also showcase their worth through their tackling and their effort. The best pass rushers are usually great tacklers and chasers, keeping opposing rushers from breaking past the line of scrimmage and shutting down screen plays and trick plays before they further develop.</p>

<p><em>** It&rsquo;s recommended that teams have at least 2 elite pass rushers **</em></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>By vectors, I mean all the different ways a team can move the ball on offense. When I was assessing offenses years ago, I would use the number of quality skill position players to determine whether an offense was loaded enough come time for the playoffs. But for those teams that are stacked at a particular position group, I&rsquo;d be overstating their potential. If a team had two phenomenal running backs that were being used interchangeably, it&rsquo;d be no different than having only one quality halfback on the roster. So I use the concept of vectors here to essentially normalize all the different concepts and tools a team can utilize on offense. Slot receivers, X receivers, Z receivers, tight ends, fullbacks, scatbacks, power runners, and mobile quarterbacks are all considered separate vectors on offense. Certain position groups can feature more than one vector. Take tight ends for example - a team with two great tight ends can count each of them as a separate vector, so long as both tight ends see action on the field regularly.</p>

<p>It should be obvious, but the more vectors you have, the better your offense should be. The logic is simple - the more ways an offense can move the ball, the more opposing defenses need to stretch their resources in order to try to limit that offense.</p>

<p>Notice I use the word &ldquo;reliable&rdquo; in the last sentence there. It&rsquo;s not easy for teams to develop reliable vectors. The rule of thumb here is a bit complex - it&rsquo;s not enough for a skill player to drum up yards and put up some gaudy numbers. The offense has to show some sort of dependence on that skill player, especially during key moments. It needs to be a dependance fostered through consistent success. Take Brandin Cooks back when he was with the Patriots in 2017. Sure, Cooks racked up over 1000 yards that year as a receiver, but his importance to the offense was overstated. The Patriots did just fine without him in the Super Bowl. Brady still managed roughly 500 yards against a well-coached Eagles defense. Danny Amendola was arguably much more valuable to that offense, especially given Brady prefers his receivers to run their routes between the numbers.</p>

<p>No, an offense doesn&rsquo;t need to fall apart should one of their vectors be lost to injury. But it <em>should</em> hurt. And that along is proof that a skill player qualifies as a vector.</p>

<p>When assessing a team&rsquo;s offense to determine its vectors, the traditional metrics are usually a good start. Yardage accrued, touchdowns, and targeting numbers all matter. Going beyond these standard statistics though, advanced stats like yards after the catch also help us identify the players that are creating more value by their own efforts. But the single best metric I&rsquo;ve seen is a proprietary metric from Pro Football Focus - Yards Per Route Ran. It&rsquo;s a metric that fantastically identifies the pass catchers that matter most to any particular offense. It shows us the average yardage accrued any time a pass catcher runs a meaningful route.</p>

<p>Still, the best thing here is the eye test. The eye test will tell us whether the receiver is truly creating additional value for this offense through individual effort or whether his numbers are more a result of scheme. The eye test also tells us whose names are called during critical moments.</p>

<p><em>** It&rsquo;s recommended that teams have at least 3 reliable vectors **</em></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Home field advantage may have lost some of its luster the past several years, but it still remains a valuable determinants of success in the postseason. Rarely do wild card teams see the Super Bowl - in fact, only three times in the past decade have we seen a wild card team fight their way to a championship appearance. Yes, I know teams with higher seeds tend to be better overall than teams with lower seeds, but you still can&rsquo;t discount home field advantage and the favorable refereeing that home teams tend to enjoy.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>It should be obvious why this is important. Time and time again, field goal kickers have been the difference between a loss and victory. Let&rsquo;s not forget the Super Bowls that were won and lost on a field goal attempt.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>It helps if the team has a defensive back that can essentially shut down a receiver or even make plays all across the field. Think of the Seattle Seahawks back in their heyday in the early part of the decade, where Richard Sherman was able to blanket just about any skill player in the NFL while Earl Thomas successfully patrolled the deeper end of the field as a ball hawk and last line of defense. Meanwhile, Kam Chancellor made his presence known as a violent box safety. Those three were critical to helping lift Seattle to two Super Bowl berths and one championship victory.</p>

<hr />

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. These are the questions that need to be answered positively for a team to be considered an actual Super Bowl contender. The more yeses, the higher your chance of hoisting the Lombardi trophy in the end.</p>

			<h2 id="49ers-seahawks">49ers @ Seahawks</h2>

<p>On the first drive, the 49ers defensive line won all their battles at the line of scrimmage. Arik Armstead and Nick Bosa have been impressive in particular.</p>

<p>The 49ers have some fantastic options on offense. George Kettle, Deebo Samuel, Emmanuel Sanders, Kyle Juscyzk, Raheem Mostert, and Matt Breida are all dependable vectors on offense.</p>

<p>More aggressive press coverage being played by the 49ers against these Seahawks. Impressive.</p>

<p>Some brilliant play from Russell Wilson on the Seahawks first scoring drive.</p>

<p>Arik Armstead impressing here, even though Nick Bosa is clearly the best down lineman on San Francisco.</p>

<p>Seahawks offense is doing so much better in the second half, largely because Russell Wilson is now throwing the ball to the right route-runners depending on whether the 49ers are in man coverage or zone coverage. It seems the 49ers are not really disguising their coverages too much in the second half. Once again speaks to Robert Saleh being an otherwise unremarkable defensive coach lucky to be working with so much talent.</p>

<p>DK Metcalf is truly a reliable vector on Seattle&rsquo;s offense.</p>

			<h2 id="texans-buccaneers">Texans @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Jameis getting steadily better, though his turnover rate is still ridiculous.</p>

<p>Texans still have no viable pass rush without JJ Watt.</p>

<p>Houston actually has some quality pass coverage personnel, though this is Jameis we&rsquo;re talking about. Let&rsquo;s see how they perform against actual competition come playoff time.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-patriots">Bills @ Patriots</h2>

<p>Bills are being gashed on the ground for steady yardage.</p>

<p>Some creative play-calling by the Patriots offense, throwing a ball to N&rsquo;Keal Harry running a wheel route after play action.</p>

<p>Patriots making hay with heavy run formations here peppered with passes here and there. Good play-calling by Josh McDaniels.</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy only down lineman on either team having any impact on this game, even if only on one play.</p>

<p>Dont&rsquo;a Hightower managed to create pressure on a 3rd down.</p>

<p>Bills still insisting on singular man coverage on Julian Edelman.</p>

<p>I notice the Patriots chipping one of the Bills defensive lineman. Probably Shaq Lawson? Jerry Hughes?</p>

<p>Jordan Phillips creating a negative play for the Bills here with a run stuff.</p>

<p>Jerry Hughes and Dont&rsquo;a Hightower stepping up in their pass rush.</p>

<p>Bills are finally stopping Patriot drives now that they&rsquo;re occasionally doubling Julian Edelman.</p>

<p>Patriot insisted on running man coverage, even on an end-of-half drive. That insistence cost them a touchdown.</p>

<p>Lots of double-clutching by Josh Allen. Seems to indicate uncertainty and a failure to read the coverage properly.</p>

<p>Shaq Lawson made solid reads on 2 of the Patriots misdirection plays, stopping these plays early in the backfield.</p>

<p>Bills have some serious issues overall with tackling.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="steelers-jets">Steelers @ Jets</h2>

<p>Holy hell, Mason Rudolph is back at quarterback. Duck Hodges may have been benched. Lord help us.</p>

<p>Gregg Williams&rsquo; zone blitzes making mincemeat of these Steelers quarterbacks.</p>

<p>Boswell is still kicking well.</p>

<p>Ah, Steelers running prevent zone at the end of the half. Fantastic&hellip;.</p>

<p>TJ Watt&rsquo;s huge strip sack leading to a touchdown for the Steelers on a bomb from Mason Rudolph. Not bad.</p>

<p>I think Williams defensive style is the real winner here. Jamal Adams being back also helped. But the Steelers offense was absolutely gutted here by the Jets and their confusing formations. Veteran quarterbacks can dissect the offense, but young inexperienced quarterbacks are left hapless.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-titans">Saints @ Titans</h2>

<p>Titans still commit hard to their play-action heavy offense, even without their bellcow in Derrick Henry. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, as defenses still bite against the fake rush and Tannehill is still doing a fantastic job connecting with his skill players. I honestly wonder if Tannehill can be considered elite.</p>

<p>The Saints and Sean Payton finding ways to get Michael Thomas matched up in single coverage&hellip;.well done.</p>

<p>A zone blitz using the man cornerback covering Michael Thomas was an ill-advised move.</p>

<p>Excellent improvisational play from Ryan Tannehill to create a touchdown from a busted screen play.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-vikings">Packers @ Vikings</h2>

<p>Cousins not doing well enough in a big moment here. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Vikings aren&rsquo;t running as much play action here, forcing Cousins to play dropback football here.</p>

<p>Danielle Hunter is easily the Vikings best defensive lineman. And on the other side, we have Za&rsquo;Darius Smith as the Packers best down lineman.</p>

<p>Aaron Rodgers seems to only really connect with DaVonte Adams and Allen Lazard, at least so far.</p>

<p>A second quarter Packers drive summed up their offense quite well. Quick throws to Davante Adams paired with runs by Jamal Adams and not much else. Aaron Rodgers failed to improvise on two separate opportunities in the red zone, once again making me wonder whether Rodgers can be considered an elite quarterback this season.</p>

<p>Allen Lazard failed to reel in a big throw. Disappointing.</p>

<p>Just questionable play-calling by the Vikings offensive coaches. A failed trick play on 3rd down only to be followed by a weak play on 4th down where receivers ran what are essentially isolation routes. I have yet to really see Cousins fake the hand-off, bootleg out to his left, and deliver a dime.</p>

<p>Dean Lowry beasting against the Vikings and their rushing attack.</p>

<p>This Vikings offensive line is just trash. More specifically, it&rsquo;s the interior that&rsquo;s awful.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-seahawks">Cardinals @ Seahawks</h2>

<p>Rasheem Greene another name to watch on this Seahawks defensive line.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-eagles">Cowboys @ Eagles</h2>

<p>Carson Wentz and his mobility has sustained a few drives.</p>

<p>Greg Ward emerging as a reliable vector on offense.</p>

<p>Dallas Goedert stepping up as a viable catching option.</p>

<p>Brandon Graham playing well as a down lineman on two plays, one a rushing play and the other a passing attempt.</p>

<p>Wentz missing a screen pass that could have closed the game. Worrisome.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, despite the season-ending injuries to their two premiere wide receivers, the Eagles may actually have five different vectors on offense - Miles Sanders as a well-rounded halfback, Dallas Goedert and Zach Ertz as versatile tight ends, Greg Ward as a receiving threat, and Wentz as an effective scrambler.</p>

<p>And yet, Philadelphia still struggles on offense. I&rsquo;m starting to genuinely think that the Eagles coaching staff on offense is not quite as competent as I once thought. Honestly, Frank Reich deserves way more credit for that incredible Super Bowl run a couple years ago.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chiefs-bears">Chiefs @ Bears</h2>

<p>Tyreek Hill is the team&rsquo;s best receiver, though Travis Kelce is a very close second. The real question here for the Chiefs offense is whether they have a reliable third vector on offense. It could be the quarterback&rsquo;s mobility, it could be Shady and the run game, or it could be a second X receiver like Sammy Watkins.</p>

<p>The Chiefs have some of the best route concepts I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>

			<h2 id="buccaneers-lions">Buccaneers @ Lions</h2>

<p>Josh Wells a liability as a replacement left tackle for Tampa Bay.</p>

<p>Detroit Lions actually blitzed for once and managed to secure an interception off that blitz.</p>

<p>The Lions are so bad in their defensive backfield, I love it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bears-packers">Bears @ Packers</h2>

<p>The Packers truly have one of the best offensive lines in the league. Their pass-blocking and run-blocking has been stellar this week and last week.</p>

<p>Great throw by Aaron Rodgers for the team&rsquo;s first touchdown, though the jury is still out on whether he can still be considered an elite quarterback this season.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="seahawks-panthers">Seahawks @ Panthers</h2>

<p>The Seahawks game plan is fairly simple here. Power runs with bootleg play-fakes peppered into the offense every now and then.</p>

<p>But the Panthers are playing the run fairly well. Maybe yet more proof that it&rsquo;s easier for a bad defense to guard against good rushers than it is for a good offense to rush the ball against a bad defense.</p>

<p>These Seahawks skill players seem a tad bit slow. Even Tyler Lockett, who made a great move to shake off a trailing defender, only to be stopped just a few yards later.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-cowboys">Rams @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>Of course the Cowboys are developing a rhythm on offense, courtesy of their offensive line dominating the Rams defensive front in the ground game. The Rams are having a real hard time bringing Elliott down quickly.</p>

<p>Aaron Donald may be the only elite defensive linemen on the Rams, considering none of the other lineman are having much of an impact at defensing the run.</p>

<p>Maybe the lesson here is that the Rams play abnormally well against division opponents. Their true worth can only be measured against teams they do not play often.</p>

<p>Once again, Goff is trash playing dropback football. The Rams need him to settle into a rhythm for the offense to see any success.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-steelers">Bills @ Steelers</h2>

<p>Josh Allen loves holding his balls.</p>

<p>Bold coaching by Sean McDermott paying off with a touchdown.</p>

<p>Nobody on the Bills defensive line really standing out, though Shaq Lawson looks to have potential.</p>

<p>McDermott loves checking out pre-snap formations and then taking timeouts, if only to gain even more intel on the opponent.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-chargers">Vikings @ Chargers</h2>

<p>Danielle Hunter is truly an elite defensive linemen. I still need time to assess whether Linval Joseph or Everson Griffen belong in the same club though. Next week&rsquo;s match against the division leader Packers will be instructive in this regard.</p>

<p>The Vikings on offense thrive off the rushing threat posed by Dalvin Cook. Lots of 12-personnel alignments to draw opposing defenders towards the line of scrimmage. I suspect a simple box count more often than not determines whether Kirk Cousins rolls out for play-action or hands the ball off to Dalvin Cook so he can work his way north.</p>

<p>The true test for Kirk Cousins comes when Dalvin Cook cannot be counted on anymore due to injury. I wonder how he holds up. More research is needed here.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="colts-saints">Colts @ Saints</h2>

<p>Once again the Saints letting up yardage on intermediate and deep crossers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-titans">Texans @ Titans</h2>

<p>The Texans pass coverage has taken a serious step up from its dreadful preseason form.</p>

<p>Interesting power running from the Titans. Their receivers sometimes line up next to the offensive line in a no-point stance only to end up blocking for Derrick Henry right alongside the rest of the offensive line.</p>

<p>The Titans power running is something impressive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="patriots-bengals">Patriots @ Bengals</h2>

<p>New England is making hay here early using rub routes.</p>

<p>This Bengals defense making silly mistakes in coverage. Why are you playing off coverage on N&rsquo;Keal Harry, of all people?</p>

<p>Now that Cincinnati started playing more aggressive man coverage, New England&rsquo;s depth receivers are struggling to matriculate the ball downfield.</p>

<p>The right side of New England&rsquo;s offensive line is struggling to hold up in pass protection, it seems.  Is this an exception to the rule?</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy is definitely the team&rsquo;s best pass rusher, but Deatrich Wise looks to have serious potential here.</p>

			<h4 id="buccaneers-lions-3"><em>Buccaneers</em> @ Lions (+3)</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to trust Jameis here, especially given that he&rsquo;s without his favorite weapon in Mike Evans. Still, Jameis did all right last week when Evans had to leave early.  Things would have been much better if he didn&rsquo;t throw three ugly interceptions against the Colts and their zone defense.</p>

<p>It helps that the Lions almost exclusively play man coverage here, as it limits opportunities for interceptions. And even if interceptions are made, return yardage will be kept to a minimum.</p>

<p>If Jameis has enough opportunities, he&rsquo;ll sling the ball all over this Lions defense and secure a good win here.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="texans-titans-3"><em>Texans</em> @ Titans (-3)</h4>

<p>The Titans have been rolling lately, whereas the Texans lost ugly to a Denver team starting a rookie quarterback. But that&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;rookie quarterbacks have the surprise factor going for them in that there&rsquo;s so little footage on them. That and the Broncos have a solid cast of playmakers on offense that a young quarterback can rely on for help.</p>

<p>Then again, does it even matter? O&rsquo;Brien just had one of the biggest wins in his career. Could he really bring himself to give a damn about a team that was more than a touchdown underdog? Doubtful. So mix this apathy from the Texans coaching staff with the uncertainty that comes when a rookie quarterback starts games and you had the recipe for a sick upset.</p>

<p>In other words, the Texans are nowhere near as bad as their loss last week. Houston can still throw and run the ball fairly well. And both of those will help keep them in contention here against a Titans defense that&rsquo;s more middling than I originally thought.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="seahawks-panthers-6-5"><em>Seahawks</em> @ Panthers (+6.5)</h4>

<p>The Panthers suck. The Seahawks need a win. And this game seems like Michael Lombardi&rsquo;s favorite play this week.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="rams-cowboys-1"><em>Rams</em> @ Cowboys (+1)</h4>

<p>It scares me that so many people are riding the Rams here. But a soft forensic analysis justifies my love for the Rams here. Give me a good team as slight favorites against another team that&rsquo;s been underwhelming the past few weeks.</p>

<p>Can the Cowboys win? Yes they can. It&rsquo;s going to take some solid coaching and inspiration though. Having gotten to know Jason Garrett over the past couple years though, I&rsquo;m pretty comfortable betting against him.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="colts-saints-8"><em>Colts</em> @ Saints (-8)</h4>

<p>Way too many points being given to a good team here. Yes, the Colts are not great, but they&rsquo;re not bad enough to justify this spread, even with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback. I&rsquo;m hoping Frank Reich&rsquo;s offensive genius can find a way to simulate some of the success the 49ers saw last week on offense.</p>

			<h2 id="49ers-saints">49ers @ Saints</h2>

<p>As expected, the Saints are working the 49ers in the short game, as the Cardinals did not too long ago.</p>

<p>Absence of Jaquiski Tartt at deep safety made a difference on an intermediate throw to Jared Cook for a touchdown.</p>

<p>49ers picking on Eli Apple on three consecutive downs for big plays. Eli Apple seems to have a hard time guarding the slant.</p>

<p>49ers coming into this game well-coached and ready, given the success of their first drive.</p>

<p>Nick Bosa having an impact on this game, stunting the Saints on two downs.</p>

<p>Deonte Harris making his presence known as a speedster on offense.</p>

<p>49ers pass protection is holding up. Although it does help that the Saints are biting hard on play-action. New Orleans needs to play more assignments on defense. Kudos to Kyle Shanahan for outcoaching Dennis Allen though.</p>

<p>Good play-calling by Sean Payton right near the goal line. Called a power run on 3rd down that set up an easy quarterback sneak on 4th down.</p>

<p>The Saints defensive line are not winning upfront. Shanahan is punking this defense.</p>

<p>49ers seem to have three solid skill players on offense - Deebo Samuel, Emmanuel Sanders, and George Kittle. Also helps that the team can run the ball with a combination of different halfbacks. And unlike Kyle Shanahan&rsquo;s Falcons the year they went to the Super Bowl, this team may have multiple pass rushers worth a damn.</p>

<p>Nick Bosa can be designated an elite pass rusher. Nobody else has really impressed me as of yet on this 49er defensive front.</p>

<p>New Orleans doesn&rsquo;t have much of a pass rush in this game. Cameron Jordan may be the only elite pass rusher on that defense.</p>

<p>I wonder if New Orleans has a tendency to play their cornerbacks more in outside technique. If so, it makes their linebackers all the more valuable, as that unit is essentially the first line of defense against crossing routes. It would explain how Jared Goff had a hell of a game against these Saints last year.</p>

<p>Then again, the corners may be playing outside technique as they&rsquo;re counting on the safeties to defend the real dangerous crossing routes. And these Saint safeties are just awful.</p>

<p>Kyle Shanahan is playing this Saints defense like a fiddle, even predicting when New Orleans will run man coverage.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chiefs-patriots">Chiefs @ Patriots</h2>

<p>Trick play by the Patriots for a touchdown - a sliding flea flicker. Well done by Josh McDaniels. Brady&rsquo;s pass was a bit underthrown too. Makes me wonder&hellip;</p>

<p>Chris Jones already working the interior of the Patriots offensive line. Him putting the heat on Brady ended a Patriots drive coming off a turnover.</p>

<p>Once again, Brady underthrowing yet another pass that might have put New England in fringe field-goal range.</p>

<p>Patriots pass rush is anemic. If New England wins, they may be able to thank Mahomes untimely hand injury for the cheap victory.</p>

<p>Patriots struggling to run this ball. Their success has largely come courtesy of the pass.</p>

<p>Brady showing his age. A bad decision (abetted a bit by pressure) led to an interception deep on the Patriots side of the field.</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy making plays against the run, as an elite defender should.</p>

<p>Brady&rsquo;s depth receivers are letting him down. That and Kansas City has found a solution here on defense, blitzing an overmatched offensive line. Combine that with a lack of a run game and it makes things almost impossible for New England here.</p>

<p>You take away Edelman and James White, you&rsquo;re left with a dysfunctional Patriots offense. Belichick and Brady poured their hearts into this game and still lost.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ravens-bills">Ravens @ Bills</h2>

<p>Ravens start their first drive executing mostly pass plays. Interesting. Let&rsquo;s see if they still insist on Lamar heaving the ball against the Bills elite pass defense.</p>

<p>Their second drive was run-heavy. Coincidentally, the Ravens were able to post their first points on the board at the end of the drive.</p>

<p>Once again, an exotic run play leads to a touchdown for this Ravens offense. This Bills defense showing spunk though.</p>

<p>Bills did mostly well defensing the run. It was the Ravens and their blitzes that threw this Buffalo offense out of its groove until the game was too out of hand. Ravens were almost too happy blitzing, almost as if they weren&rsquo;t worried about Josh Allen being able to dissect their undermanned pass coverage.</p>

<p>Ravens man coverage defenders did incredibly well guarding against Buffalo&rsquo;s smaller and more agile receiver unit. That&rsquo;s two weeks in a row now that the Ravens defensive backfield held up against a receiver corps known more for speed than size.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="redskins-packers">Redskins @ Packers</h2>

<p>I honestly wonder whether it&rsquo;s easier stopping an offense that can rush the ball well or running against a defense that struggles to neutralize the ground game.</p>

<p>Dear lord&hellip;Haskins is just awful.</p>

<p>Aaron Jones is something special when he accelerates into the second level. And it&rsquo;s quite impressive to see Green Bay just lining up in power run formations and pound the ball for big yardage.</p>

<p>The Smith brothers can both be considered elite pass rushers so far. Za&rsquo;Darius is clearly the better half in the duo though. The Redskins were finally making hay through power runs until Za&rsquo;Darius finally forced a negative play by shooting through an interior gap. It didn&rsquo;t matter though as Dwayne Haskins was able to convert on a 3rd and long.</p>

<p>Lazard making a big catch to keep the chains moving for the Packers offense.</p>

<p>Washington is just injured. Quarterback is operating on one leg, their best pass rusher is dealing with a leg injury, and their best halfback has been ruled out in the first half with a knee injury.</p>

<p>Aaron Rodgers is seriously struggling to find open receivers, despite having several seconds in the pocket on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>Yes, it is easier to defend a good rushing team than to rush the ball against a bad team. All a defense needs to do to stop the run is to put more men in the box. I wish I knew this for the Patriots game.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="steelers-cardinals">Steelers @ Cardinals</h2>

<p>Steeler fans travel well.</p>

<p>Why is Kyler playing so scared? Kliff should be scheming these quick plays better.</p>

<p>I have to say&hellip;Kyler may be shitting himself here. I wonder if being hit by NFL linemen is taking its toll on him mentally.</p>

<p>Better play from Kyler following a Pittsburgh turnover. Though any success I saw on that drive came more from scheme than quarterback play. Still, the Steelers defense are doing a solid job limiting Kyler Murray&rsquo;s options here. Even when Kyler attempted to run the ball outside, Minkah Fitzpatrick immediately cut him off.</p>

<p>Finally, the up-tempo play-calling is yielding results for this Arizona offense. Steelers are trying their damnedest to confuse Kyler by crowding the line of scrimmage with linebackers though.</p>

<p>Duck Hodges making hay with scramble runs.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-raiders">Titans @ Raiders</h2>

<p>Raiders are dismal against the pass.</p>

<p>Ryan Tannehill really impressing in a bit of a tough situation here, delivering on a touchdown bomb while under severe duress.</p>

<p>Raiders can run the ball with backs other than Josh Jacobs.</p>

<p>Oakland committing to stopping the run, lining up quite a bit in their 4-3 base defense.</p>

<p>Likewise, Tennessee looking to cut the Raiders off on their short yardage plays. The Titans defensive backs overplayed the flat on one play, giving up an easy touchdown heave.</p>

<p>Oakland may have some of the worst defensive backs in the league.</p>

<p>Tennessee may have issues of their own as well in their defensive backfield.</p>

<p>Titans play pretty intelligently on defense.</p>

<p>Tennessee&rsquo;s offense has some character to it. Hurrying the pace at the correct moments, calling semi-trick plays towards the end of the game to close things out&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="seahawks-rams">Seahawks @ Rams</h2>

<p>Seahawks and Rams know each other a little too well.</p>

<p>On one play, the Seahawks tried to bait Jared Goff into throwing a wide receiver screen in a situation that seemingly favored such a screen. The Rams anticipated this, as one of the skill players that the Seahawks presumed would be blocking ended up releasing and running a fly and catching a big throw to set LA up for a touchdown.</p>

<p>Likewise on defense, the Rams still kept seven men in the box even though the Seahawks spread four receivers out. The Rams were correct to do so though, as the Hawks ended up running the ball.</p>

<p>If Goff can be scripted into rhythm, this Rams offense looks so much better.  While Goff might not be worth much as a dropback passer, he can certainly execute on scheme.</p>

<p>Two errors killed a Seahawks drive.</p>
