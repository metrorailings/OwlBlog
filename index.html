	<div class='postTitle'>Preseason Review: New York Jets</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Sam Darnold</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Robby Anderson (WR), Le’Veon Bell (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Jamison Crowder (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Leonard Williams (DE), Quinnen Williams (DE), C.J. Mosley (LB), Jamal Adams (SS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Joe Douglas (New GM), Adam Gase (New HC), Dowell Loggains (New OC), Gregg Williams (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 7</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Nearly every single coach on the staff this year is new. Interestingly enough, only the two defensive back coaches from last year managed to survive the complete overhaul of the Jets organization this year.</p>

<hr />

<p>Not to give myself a pat on the back here, but my assessment from last year was spot-on. The Jets sunk quickly last season due to a lack of talent at key positions along with several rocky performances from a rookie quarterback trying to find his groove. The former general manager Mike Maccagnan went big in free agency in the offseason, dumping out the team’s purse on players like Le’Veon Bell, Jamison Crowder, and C.J. Mosley. It seemed almost as if this year was intended to be that great leap forward into relevancy for the franchise. But soon after the draft, Maccagnan was ousted along with his personnel director in a move many described as sloppy. But honestly, it might have been the right move, despite the bad timing.</p>

<p>The reality is that Maccagnan and his personnel man were only committed to making splashy moves, often at the expense of team culture, draft picks, and salary cap space. The signing of Le’Veon Bell best exemplified their foolishness. It was frankly a stupid move handing out all that cash to a running back that hasn’t been playing football for over a year. And it’s all the more stupid considering the messy circumstances under which Bell left Pittsburgh. It was much less a move made by a professional general manager and more a move made by an impulsive fan that only cares about winning immediately. On a positive note though, hiring Joe Douglas to take over general manager duties from Maccagnan was a smart move, according to Michael Lombardi. Douglas understands team culture and the fundamentals of building a team capable of long-term success.</p>

<p>That being said, the unfortunate truth is that it’ll take a year or two for this team to recover from Maccagnan’s bad decisions. Le’Veon Bell’s contract makes him way too expensive to release any time soon, meaning Gase will have to work to mitigate any dysfunction his presence may sow inside the locker room. Trumaine Johnson will still be a black spot on this roster for at least one more year given the outsized value of his contract as well. More importantly though, Gase has his work cut out for him - Maccagnan left this team undermanned for the better part of his tenure. This year’s personnel’s moves went a long way to correcting some of the deficiencies on the roster, but work is still needed&hellip;especially along the receiver corps.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Super Bowl LIII - Prediction</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>It&rsquo;s all come down to this&hellip;.the Los Angeles Rams versus the New England Patriots. What a shitty Super Bowl.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the pieces I wrote recently on both teams, I&rsquo;ve focused on a few things - the coaching and the pass rush. And I&rsquo;ve come to one conclusion&hellip;the Rams may have a slightly more talented team, but the Patriots are the more efficient team.</p>

<p>For Los Angeles to win, they need sensational performances from Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh. Why is that? Well frankly, I don&rsquo;t think Jared Goff and his offense will be able to keep pace with New England in terms of scoring. Therefore, the Rams will need defensive stops here to keep this game within reach. And the best way to cull Patriot drives short is to sack and harass Brady in the pocket. That being said, the Rams only have one fantastic pass rusher on their team in Donald. And typically, you need multiple elite defensive linemen to regularly harangue Brady, as Belichick and his coaching staff are usually apt at limiting the opposing team&rsquo;s best pass rusher. So as a result, this game rests in Suh&rsquo;s hands&hellip;and I&rsquo;m not that convinced of Suh&rsquo;s potential to wreak havoc here, despite his performance over the last two games. His regular season numbers are a little too pedestrian for me to confidently declare him as a reliable pass rusher, especially against offensive lines as stout as that of the Patriots.</p>

<p>While people can point out that the Eagles still won the championship last year without harassing Brady much, that Philadelphia team had three things going in their favor - an elite quarterback, more offensive weaponry, and the best defensive line in the league. Philly managed to keep pace with the Patriots on offense, posting over 500 yards on offense. Despite that, the Patriots were still on their way to claiming their sixth championship until Brandon Graham managed to blow past a guard and strip sack Brady, guaranteeing Philadelphia its first Super Bowl victory. So the pass rush still ultimately mattered, even if it played a much lesser role here than in other Super Bowls the Patriots have lost. Philadelphia had that luxury of not having to rely so much on its pass rush thanks to some brilliant performances from their offensive players. I&rsquo;m not sure if the Rams could count on their offense carrying them should their defense fail to generate stops.</p>

<p>Sean McVay is a football genius, but even he can only do so much with Jared Goff as his quarterback and his best skill player injured for the rest of the season. That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m declaring Cooper Kupp as the best skill player on that team. A little while ago, I would have found it preposterous that anybody but Todd Gurley can be declared as the most important player on the Rams offense&hellip;but ever since he suffered that bizarre injury in the game against the Chiefs, the man has not been the same. His role on the team has been supplanted by C.J. Anderson, who McVay essentially recognizes as the team&rsquo;s lead halfback at this point. Sure, Gurley&rsquo;s had two weeks now to recover even more, but I&rsquo;m not sure if he&rsquo;ll even be close to top form in time for the Super Bowl - honestly, it might take a whole offseason for the man to completely rehabilitate himself!</p>

<p>But even if McVay had an elite quarterback and more weapons on offense, could he match wits with Belichick? Possibly&hellip;but he needs to work more on his game management skills. Over the last couple games, I&rsquo;ve seen him make some awful decisions on fourth down. On two separate occasions, the man made some bizarre calls on fourth-and-short situations. Even though the games ultimately panned out for the Rams, it still worries me that the man made these strange decisions in the first place. Still, I do think McVay has the chops to outplay Belichick, so long as he has the horses on offense.</p>

<p>But he doesn&rsquo;t. If anything, his horses are on defense. But the defense is critically limited at its most important function - the pass rush. And that is the reason I&rsquo;m going with the Patriots here to win Super Bowl LIII.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Analyzing the Rams Pass Rush Against the Packers</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>One of the biggest factors determining which team wins in the Super Bowl is the pass rush. Almost always, the team with the better overall pass rush ends up hoisting the Lombardi trophy when the game is over. So let&rsquo;s evaluate the overall efficacy of the Rams pass rush relative to the Patriots pass rush.</p>

<p>We do this by studying their games against common opponents. We look only for those common opponents that played both teams at roughly the same point in the season. In this case, the Rams and Patriots only have one such common opponent - the Packers. New England and Los Angeles played Green Bay literally a week apart from one another. Both games were also played on their respective home fields, so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about controlling for home field advantage.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sacks</strong>: 3</p>

<p><strong>Hits</strong>: 6</p>

<p><strong>Hurries</strong>: 6</p>

<p><strong>Thrown Away / Batted Passes</strong>: 0</p>

<p><strong>Passes Attempted:</strong> 34</p>

<p><strong>Negligible Passes:</strong> 4</p>

<hr />

<p>Aaron Rodgers was involved in 34 total pass-eligible plays in the game. 4 of those plays were passes that Rodgers threw less than one second after receiving the snap, so we could factor them out of the equation here.</p>

<p>So that being said&hellip;Los Angeles&rsquo; pressure score becomes <strong><em>0.45.</em></strong> An excellent score in fact. Better than the Patriots. A little concerning for New England backers.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Patriots Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Rather than do quick statements discussing the Patriots and their victory over Kansas City to retain possession of the AFC crown&hellip;I&rsquo;ll be doing a deep dive here in order to more correctly illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this New England team as they head into the Super Bowl.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="1st-quarter">1st Quarter</h4>

<p>The first play of the day sets the tone for the Patriots on offense. Against a seven-man box, Sony Michel still manages to chew off 11 yards behind some excellent blocks by his offensive linemen, his fullback James Develin, and tight end Rob Gronkowski. And now it begins to dawn on me - what good is a fantastic pass rush if the defensive line is completely inept at stopping the run?</p>

<p>That first drive was just domination by the Patriots. The Chiefs had forced New England into a 3rd and long position near the end of the drive, but for some awful reason, the Chiefs decided to put their best edge rusher in coverage against the Patriots&rsquo; best receiver. Even though Dee Ford was able to hold his own against Julian Edelman for a few seconds, the Chiefs&rsquo; neutered pass rush was unable to even so much as breathe on Tom Brady, allowing for an easy completion over the middle.</p>

<p>Poor coaching will be a repeated emphasis here. People have ridiculed Andy Reid for his record of failure in the postseason. Some have even theorized that the man is simply unable to lead a team to the promised land. And I&rsquo;m starting to believe that. Andy Reid and Bob Sutton were thoroughly out-coached here, as I&rsquo;ll point out time and time again.</p>

<p>On the Chiefs&rsquo; first drive, I think it&rsquo;s becoming clear Patrick Mahomes is racked by nerves coming into this match. Why is he insisting on throwing the ball to Sammy Watkins twice in a row? On that first play, Travis Kelce was more open than Watkins. On the second play, Watkins was held in check by the Patriots&rsquo; best cornerback in Stephon Gilmore. I understand Tyreek Hill is being blanketed in double coverage, but then the next man up should be either Travis Kelce or your speedy halfback in Damien Williams&hellip;.not Sammy &lsquo;asshat&rsquo; Watkins.</p>

<p>I think the Patriots have keyed in on an awful tendency in Mahomes&rsquo; passing game - the sophomore quarterback is addicted to throwing the ball deep. Take away his best deep threat in Tyreek Hill and he&rsquo;ll respond by targeting Sammy Watkins instead. It makes sense - Watkins is supposed to the other skill player complimenting Hill in the deep passing offense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to Andy Reid to iron this tendency out from his young quarterback, but it&rsquo;s clear the veteran coach has not yet fixed this aspect of Mahomes&rsquo; game. It&rsquo;s still not too late to make Patrick see the error of his ways, but as we&rsquo;ll see, very little will change as we progress in this game.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hits on Mahomes: 2</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="2nd-quarter">2nd Quarter</h4>

<p>The first Chiefs drive this quarter saw the Patriots pressuring Mahomes on two plays. Despite that, Kansas City was in a position to move the chains, but Damien Williams failed to punch ahead for one yard on 3rd down.</p>

<p>The second Chiefs drive could have ended in a touchdown. After a beautiful bomb to Tyreek Hill, Kansas City was in prime scoring position. On the very next play, the Patriots called a six-man blitz, leaving all the skill players in single coverage situations. Had Patrick Mahomes thrown a slightly better ball, Damien Williams would have had a touchdown reception here. Instead, it seems New England&rsquo;s pass rushers were able to suffocate pocket just enough to compel Mahomes into throwing an awkward pass. The result will go down as an incompletion, but it really was a missed opportunity to tie up the game against New England. On third down, the Patriots called yet another blitz that finally hit home and resulted in a sack that took Kansas out of field goal range. It was a sad end to the Chiefs&rsquo; most promising drive up to this point.</p>

<p>New England, meanwhile, was able to move the ball seemingly at will. Luckily, two of their drives in the quarter ended with no points, thanks to bad plays from Tom Brady and James White. The former threw a silly interception in the end zone and the latter couldn&rsquo;t reel in a screen pass that would have likely gone for significant yardage.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what though, that last New England drive was a master class in coaching. Not only did the Patriots commit to running the ball in order to wipe as much time off the clock as possible, but New England made fools out of this Kansas City defensive line on two occasions with well-timed screens. Once again, I have to emphasize the coaching here - the Patriots have some phenomenal coaches here. I have to commend them for instilling some discipline here in their their defensive players - the Patriots box defenders rarely fell for Kansas City&rsquo;s attempts at misdirection and trickery.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hits on Mahomes: 4</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="3rd-quarter">3rd Quarter</h4>

<p>The Chiefs fire out of the gate with a four-play touchdown drive. Most notably, Mahomes wasn&rsquo;t touched even once on this drive, not even on a critical 3rd down when the Patriots only sent three rushers to try and pressure him. A big pass to Sammy Watkins despite Stephon Gilmore in coverage put the Chiefs in the red zone. Then the next play was well-designed - Travis Kelce was positioned on the right while Tyreek Hill was stationed to the left of Mahomes. Knowing the Patriots would send their safety to Hill&rsquo;s side of the field, Andy Reid essentially schemed things so that Kelce would only be guarded by one defensive back. It didn&rsquo;t take long for Travis to win his match-up and catch the ball for a touchdown.</p>

<p>One thing that&rsquo;s becoming clear to me as I watch the Chiefs this quarter is that Bob Sutton finally made some adjustments on defense to slow down the Patriots&rsquo; rushing attack. Sutton now has three of his men lining up as tackles along the middle of the line of the scrimmage. It&rsquo;s much harder for the Patriots to gain any leverage in runs now. However, the additional reinforcement along th edefensive line comes at the expense of the linebackers&rsquo; corps - instead of fielding two players as conventional linebackers, the Chiefs now only field only one player behind their defensive linemen.</p>

<p>On the last play of the 3rd quarter, Mahomes missed Kelce on what would have been a fairly easy touchdown. To be fair though, his target was open as well, but that throw was significantly more difficult to make. Kelce literally ran across the formation into empty space behind two other receivers running their routes. A simple lob in his direction was all that was needed for a touchdown on that play.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hits on Mahomes: 3</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="4th-quarter">4th Quarter</h4>

<p>Watching the 4th quarter, it&rsquo;s clearly becoming evident to me that the Chiefs defensive line is turning into a vulnerability. The problem with the Chiefs is that the line is only capable of two modes - run stopping mode and pass rush mode. When the line tightens up with bigger bodies towards the middle, the Chiefs become effective defensing the run, but the pass rush loses its teeth. When the line widens into a more traditional four-man look and the Chiefs have all their stud defensive linemen out there, Kansas becomes effective rushing the passer, but then the rush defense loses virtually all of its efficacy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s dawning on me that I overrated this Chiefs defensive line. After all, what good is a phenomenal pass rush if the defensive line and the linebackers behind them are completely inept in containing opposing rushers? Therefore, any analysis I conduct in the future on a playoff team&rsquo;s defense has to account for their ability to stop the run with their box players.</p>

<p>By the way, if I haven&rsquo;t mentioned this before, then I&rsquo;ll bring it up here - Sony Michel has played mostly terrific this game. His decision making  and cuts have been on point so far. It appears the rookie is finally realizing some of that first-round potential.</p>

<p>Following the Patriots giving the ball up on downs several minutes into the fourth quarter, the Chiefs had an opportunity to finally gain some momentum. All they needed was a successful drive from their offense that ends in some points. But what we get instead is a three-and-out. A failed run on first down and two poor passes from Mahomes put a quick kibosh on the drive. Really, Mahomes is worrying me here. It&rsquo;s clear as hell that the Patriots were in a Cover-0 formation on 3rd down, but the Chiefs signal caller was awkwardly late throwing the ball to Tyreek Hill. Had he recognized that Hill was in a position to exploit the defense immediately after the snap, he could have actually moved the chains here with a quick sideways pass to Hill.</p>

<p>The Chiefs catch another break, as an errant pass by Brady results in an interception. On the second play, Reid finally dialed up a beautiful play, moving Mahomes to the right only to have him throw the ball against the grain to the left side of the field to a wide open Damien Williams. Running behind three offensive linemen, the rookie rusher sauntered into the end zone.</p>

<p>With the Chiefs now ahead, the opportunity is there to close out the game. And now, <strong><em>finally</em></strong>, the Chiefs opt to play some good defense. Aggressive press coverage against the Patriots receivers forces Brady to hold on to the ball a touch longer. Unfortunately, the pass rush is unable to hit home. Granted, you have a few players coming close here and there, but Brady still has far too much time in the pocket to breathe comfortably. It&rsquo;s worth noting Chris Jones is sidelined at this point with injury, so the only stud rushers lining up along the line are Justin Houston and Dee Ford. Still, neither one  of these two are slouches, so Kansas shouldn&rsquo;t be having much issue nailing Brady. The problem is that these defenders are being chipped or outright  stone-walled by multiple Patriot blockers. As a result, neither of these edge rushers are unable to even work the pocket until it&rsquo;s too late. The coaches aren&rsquo;t helping much either - neither Houston nor Ford are straying from their wide-nine position. Edge blitzes aren&rsquo;t being called much either.</p>

<p>It also hurts that Tom Brady is playing his best football to close out the game. Without much of a rushing game to carry the offense, the team vested their faith in Brady&rsquo;s arm. And that trust paid off tremendously, as Brady made some key throws to receivers like Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan and Rob Gronkowski to keep the chains moving. Within the red zone, the Patriots were able to count on Sony Michel punching the ball across the goal line on two separate occasions.</p>

<p>The Chiefs answered back with their own scores and a field goal to tie the game up, but a favorable coin toss put the ball back in Brady&rsquo;s hands in overtime. The rest is history. Overtime does not need to be discussed here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hits on Mahomes: 3</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>This game hurts me. The Chiefs are the better team from a roster perspective. Playing on their own turf should have given Kansas a decisive advantage here. I was almost certain the Patriots would need some ridiculous luck to pull out a victory here.</p>

<p>But it turns out it would be bad coaching from the Chiefs brass that would allow New England to steal a win here. Andy Reid and Bob Sutton were truly derelict in their coaching duties here - whatever game plan they drew up earlier in the week was clearly ineffective from the get-go. Strategic adjustments were usually made far too late to have any considerable impact. The Patriots clearly gained a beat on where the Chiefs were vulnerable and attacked those weak points with heartless abandon.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s becoming evident to me that Andy Reid is a truly unfit coach come playoff time. The man had so many things align well this season and he still managed to squander any championship hopes his team may have had.</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Rather than list bullet points quickly explaining the Rams victory in the NFC championship game, I&rsquo;ll be doing a deep dive, keeping notes here as I watch coaches&rsquo; film of the game.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="1st-quarter">1st Quarter</h4>

<p>The Saints started out hot, thanks to a smartly executed tight-end screen, Alvin Kamara running wheel routes, and Michael Thomas making catches against tight coverage.</p>

<p>Still&hellip;there were indications the Saints&rsquo; success would be a little unsustainable. First off, Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh were constantly winning battles at the line of scrimmage - the two defensive tackles not only managed to harassed Drew Brees on a few of his pass attempts, but also limited Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram on run plays. Even against six-man boxes, the Rams were able to hold their own against New Orleans&rsquo; rushers thanks to the play of those two key playmakers along the defensive line. Second, Los Angeles wholly committed themselves to double-teaming Michael Thomas whenever possible. Even though Thomas was able to produce in the first quarter, it would only be so long before Los Angeles would finally put the clamps on him.  And without Thomas, the Saints would have no receivers to depend upon in the passing game. Now if Drew Brees was an elite quarterback, he&rsquo;d eventually find other receiving outlets as the game progressed&hellip;but we&rsquo;ll talk more about that later.</p>

<h4 id="2nd-quarter">2nd Quarter</h4>

<p>The Rams offense finally got going after a successful fake punt deep in their half of the field. Immediately after the chains moved, McVay called in some of his best plays and sped up the tempo in order to try and ensure that fake punt would not be in vain. And it worked. The Rams were able to chew off major yardage on this drive. Thanks to McVay&rsquo;s game management, Jared Goff marshaled his offense down the field in a hostile environment. And even though this drive would only result in a field goal, it helped calm him down.</p>

<p>Drew Brees and company would get the ball back only to go three and out. First down was a failed run that was blown up in the back field courtesy of Aaron Donald. On second down, Brees was trying to hit a receiver running a deep dig route behind another skill player running upfield. But Aqib Talib rushed over from his zone on the other side of the field to cut off the dig receiver at the catch point, forcing Brees to pull the ball back and dump the pass off to a tight end in an act of desperation. On third down, the Saints thought they could flare Kamara out behind two skill receivers, but the Rams reacted too quickly and kept him from even catching the ball cleanly.</p>

<p>Brees would get the ball back soon after following a Rams punt. And the drive was looking positive at first&hellip;until Suh and Dante Fowler started wreaking havoc in the backfield. A fresh series of Saints downs began with Suh blowing by the guard to sack Brees for a 6-yard loss. On the next play, Fowler curled around right tackle Ryan Ramcyzk, invading Brees&rsquo; personal space and throwing him into a panicky state that essentially ended any promise the play might have had. 3rd down, the Saints were content waving a white flag and playing for field position instead on the ensuing punt.</p>

<p>The Rams&rsquo; last drive of the half ended successfully in a touchdown. Goff deserves some major credit on this drive - playing against nickel coverage in obvious passing plays, he still led his team down the field, his best moment being a dime pass 36 yards downfield to Brandin Cooks against man coverage. On top of that, the New Orleans pass rushers were simply unable to get any consistent pressure on Goff. The only time Goff felt any heat came on blitzes. The Rams adjusted pretty quickly and called max protection sets to ensure Goff had a bit more time in the pocket.</p>

<p>The quarter had eerie similarities to last week&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="3rd-quarter">3rd Quarter</h4>

<p>The Rams started off on a weak note, striking out on their first drive without even gaining a single yard. The Saints, on the other hand, came out strong. Some adjustments are obvious here:</p>

<ul>
<li>No longer are the Saints halfbacks running headlong towards Suh and Donald. Most of the run plays were angled away from those two.</li>
<li>Alvin Kamara became the team&rsquo;s bell cow in the pass game. Sean Payton must have noticed the Rams were a little too giddy with the man coverage on the back end of their defense. Which means coming out of the backfield, Kamara would almost always find himself matched up against a linebacker. Brees was more than happy exploiting that obvious mismatch.</li>
</ul>

<p>The drive ended in a touchdown. The Rams were put in a bad spot - crap out on the next drive and the Saints would have seized all the momentum in the game. But Goff and Brandin Cooks saw to it that their team wouldn&rsquo;t fall too far behind. When the Rams offense stepped back out onto the field, the two connected on three big passes. The Saints&rsquo; coverage defenders were simply unable to keep pace with Cooks. Eli Apple and Marshon Lattimore didn&rsquo;t even bother pressing the speedster at the line of scrimmage. And in a zone look on one play, not one Saint could track Cooks as he scurried behind his offensive linemen on a bootleg release. Speaking of which, the Saints defensive front fell way too hard for the bootleg on two different occasions, leaving Goff way too comfortable to air the ball out to Cooks.  No surprise then that Los Angeles came away with a touchdown to keep this game within three points.</p>

<p>The Saints started the ensuing drive on a very positive note, moving the chains twice. Then Aaron Donald blew up two consecutive plays to put the Saints into a long 3rd down situation. Given that the referees in the game were content letting defensive backs mug receivers in coverage, it&rsquo;s not much of a surprise that the Saints failed to convert against aggressive man coverage. Once again, the Rams defensive line forced another punt out of the Saints.</p>

<h4 id="4th-quarter">4th Quarter</h4>

<p>The last three drives stand out in this quarter. On the third-to-last drive, Goff was sensational on two big passes, including one on a long scramble out of the pocket. It&rsquo;s clear New Orleans had no respect for Goff&rsquo;s mobility - the third-year quarterback made them pay dearly for that disrespect here. Now this drive should have ended in a touchdown, but Sean McVay made the unusual move of not chancing a goal-line push on 4th and 1. Apparently, the man was content simply notching the game into a tie at that point. I&rsquo;m not happy with the decision - the playoffs reward those coaches that make bold wagers. With only one yard to go, McVay needed to show confidence in his offense at that moment.</p>

<p>On the next drive, the Saints desperately needed some positive gains to score and, more importantly, close out the game without giving the ball back to the Rams. After a desperation lob to Alvin Kamara to move the chains, Drew Brees hooked up with Ted Ginn on a huge throw to put the Saints in position for an easy field goal. But then the next play may have been proof positive of something a few astute analysts have noted - Brees has lost some of his magic recently. The veteran passer was simply supposed to complete an easy pass to Michael Thomas on the next down. It was a play designed to keep the clock moving and throw the Rams defense off.</p>

<p>But the throw was <em>limp</em>. It was <em>weak</em>. So weak that even the sure-handed Thomas couldn&rsquo;t reel in the ball. It&rsquo;s a damn shame too, as not only did the clock stop, but the Saints lost a down at such a critical moment. So how did Brees fail to make such an easy pass? Is it possible the man has been dealing with a hidden shoulder injury that&rsquo;s been nagging him over the past few weeks? If so, was that shoulder injury aggravated on that big throw? A silent injury would not only explain his lack of strength on this throw, but it would also shed light on his mundane numbers over the past several weeks. Ever since that great midseason run when the Saints distinguished themselves as the top team in the league, Brees hasn&rsquo;t been sharp. His deep passes lacked touch and whatever rapport he&rsquo;s developed with his secondary receivers was lost.  The Saints were still able to lock themselves in as the top seed of the NFC, but something was off with their star signal caller. An injury would explain things quite nicely. It would also explain why even on that deep pass, the ball was wickedly underthrown.</p>

<p>Anyway, second down was a failed run. Third down ended with an incomplete pass that should have been flagged as defensive pass interference. And even though some people insist that the Saints had the game stolen from the at that very moment, it&rsquo;s clear to me that the Rams were the better team. Even if the referees called that play properly and New Orleans went on to grind the clock out to a Super Bowl berth, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a good win. New Orleans was <strong>clearly</strong> the weaker team in this match-up.</p>

<p>But with some abetting from the referees, the Rams were still in position to contest the result of this team. A touchdown would have resulted in a decisive Rams victory. A field goal would send this game into overtime.  But the Los Angeles offense would need to push the ball at least 40 or so yards down the field to put themselves in position to post points on the board.  Before the game, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect Goff to perform well in such a tense moment. But the man was mostly fantastic, connecting on two big passes to place his team in position for a mid-range field goal. Only way he could have done better is if he threw a cleaner pass towards Robert Woods on a 3rd down conversion. Had he thrown a better ball, it&rsquo;s possible Woods would have motored into the end zone for a touchdown to end the game once and for all. But instead, the Rams settled for a field goal to push the game into extra time.</p>

<h4 id="overtime">Overtime</h4>

<p>Two key things that I&rsquo;ve emphasized time and time again in this analysis once again emerge in the waning minutes of this game - the Rams&rsquo; suffocating defensive line and unexpectedly amazing play from Jared Goff.</p>

<p>The Saints, despite being the first team to possess the ball, was unable to do anything here, as the Rams&rsquo; pass rushers forced Drew Brees into throwing an ugly interception early into the drive. It was a fitting end for a defensive line that dominated the trenches for most of the game.</p>

<p>All Jared Goff and his offense needed was about 20 or so yards to put his team in position to kick a field goal. And the Rams&rsquo; signal caller made fantastic passes against heavy duress. Despite Saints&rsquo; defensive linemen bearing down on him on two separate plays, Goff was still able to complete passes towards his safety valves, putting his team on the cusp of field goal range. McVay, showing some gutsy trust in his kicker, decided to attempt the field goal anyway, knowing that a missed kick would leave his defense in dire straits. But that trust paid off, as Zuerlein was able to kick the ball through the uprights from 57 yards out, effectively kicking his team to the Super Bowl.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>People are making a ruckus over the refs missing an obvious pass interference call against the Saints that would have allowed them to close out the game. And sure, New Orleans has the right to hold a grudge against Bill Vinovich and his crew for years to come&hellip;but it&rsquo;s clear that the Rams were the better team in this contest.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say the Saints were awful from start to finish - New Orleans had sporadic flashes of brilliance, but on most other plays, the team was just stagnant. It&rsquo;s clear Brees is not that great quarterback that was playing at a near-historic level earlier in the season. Something happened to him - it could have been injury, it could have been age finally catching up to him suddenly, it could have been him failing to practice quarterbacking fundamentals late in the season&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know. But the man had no business being considered an elite quarterback.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Ndamukong Suh may have finally broken out as an elite defensive lineman. Before the postseason, I thought Aaron Donald was the only Los Angeles&rsquo; pass rusher worth recognizing as an elite pass rusher. It&rsquo;s clear I was wrong and Suh deserved some recognition as well. Honestly though&hellip;Suh&rsquo;s done little throughout the regular season to justify elite status. It wasn&rsquo;t until the game against Dallas in the divisional round that Ndamukong finally rounded back into top form - maybe playoffs truly brings the very best out of him?</p>

<p>If I could go back in time to readjust the comparison chart I drew up while previewing this game, I&rsquo;d dock a few points away from New Orleans, as Brees could no longer be considered an elite passer. Furthermore, I&rsquo;d add an additional category to the chart to account for pass rushers like Suh and Dante Fowler, pass rushers that did not really impress in the regular season, but could present themselves as game-changers in the playoffs.</p>

			<p>The New England Patriots meet the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium for the AFC Championship game.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Championship Round Analysis - Patriots @ Chiefs.jpg" alt="" />The Patriots have underwhelmed this year compared to years past. On the road this season, the team has only managed three wins. And frankly, only one of those victories came against a quality team.</p>

<p>While the Patriots were able to beat the Chiefs in the regular season, that was a home game against Patrick Mahomes early in the year.  Mahomes has gotten better since then. And frankly, it can even be argued that Kansas City was the better team in that contest - if the Chiefs made more of an effort to cut down on the silly mistakes that game, then we&rsquo;d be talking about a Kansas team with one more victory under its belt this season.</p>

<p>Both teams come into this rematch down a key player on offense. The Chiefs are missing Kareem Hunt coming out of the backfield while the Patriots can no longer count on Josh Gordon catching deep passes. But Kansas City has a promising replacement for Hunt in Damien Williams - the former Dolphin has been racking up some solid numbers over the last several weeks. Meanwhile, New England has yet to find that deep threat capable of replicating Gordon&rsquo;s production. Gronkowski might come the closest to being that player, but age has finally caught up with him this year - the man isn&rsquo;t what he&rsquo;s once been. So if anything, the Chiefs carry the slight edge here in terms of overall offense.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one area where Kansas City can definitively declare an advantage in this match-up, it&rsquo;s on the defensive line. Kansas City has one of the best defensive lines in the league thanks to a trio of elite pass rushers in Chris Jones, Dee Ford, and Justin Houston. So long as the Chiefs&rsquo; secondary can force Tom Brady to hold the ball just a touch longer, I have faith that their defensive front will be harassing the GOAT on a regular basis. And really, if there&rsquo;s a surefire way to throw great quarterbacks off their game, it&rsquo;s relentless pressure on the quarterback. There&rsquo;s a reason I place so much emphasis on the pass rush when analyzing postseason games. It was the Giants key to success in 2007 and 2011, it was Denver&rsquo;s key to success in 2015, and it&rsquo;ll likely serve the same role for Kansas when they win the Super Bowl this year.</p>

<p>As for coaching, I have nothing but high regards for Bill Belichick. But even Belichick can only do so much with what he&rsquo;s given. Yes, he out-coached the royal hell out of Anthony Lynn last week, but Andy Reid is no Anthony Lynn - the man can adjust on the fly. Belichick needs to concoct a fantastic game plan here should he want to take his Patriots to their third consecutive Super Bowl. But given his team&rsquo;s limitations on both sides of the ball, Belichick will find it damn near impossible to devise a winning plan here. So expect the Patriots&rsquo; season to end today.</p>

			<p>The NFC championship will be the Los Angeles Rams visiting the New Orleans Saints in a rematch from the regular-season.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Championship Round Analysis - Rams @ Saints.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Rams finally adjusted and began running the ball more, this time with CJ Anderson as the lead halfback. Gurley was the better rusher last week on a yards-per-rush basis, but CJ Anderson was without doubt the team&rsquo;s bell cow in the run game. And Anderson will need to go off again for his team to have any hope of winning in a hostile Superdome this week.</p>

<p>As I noted last week, it&rsquo;s pointedly difficult to win on the road in the postseason. A team needs to be stacked to have a real chance at winning, and the Rams fall short in that regard. Without Cooper Kupp, Los Angeles is one man down from having at least three reliable weapons on offense. It&rsquo;s a problem made all the more worse when you don&rsquo;t have an elite quarterback that can improvise and function under stressful circumstances - let&rsquo;s be real, Goff isn&rsquo;t that player that can put a team on his back, so he desperately needs some help here. On defense, Los Angeles lacks another pass rusher that can truly compliment Aaron Donald. Donkey Kong Suh was fantastic last week, but he&rsquo;s been unable to play at a consistently high level all throughout the season. I don&rsquo;t foresee him carrying over his success from last week into this game&hellip;unless a silent injury that&rsquo;s been nagging him the whole regular season has been suddenly lifted going into the postseason.</p>

<p>I feel pretty comfortable taking New Orleans here, especially given the competence of their coaching staff.  After the Eagles exploded out of the gate with two consecutive scores last week, the Saints&rsquo; coaches adjusted defensively, rendering Philly&rsquo;s offense impotent for the rest of the game. It takes some damn good coaching to adjust that quickly. So Sean Payton and his crew won some credibility in my eyes that day.</p>
