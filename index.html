			<p>The dynasty team finds its way into the playoffs yet again, this time as the second seed in the American Football Conference.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-tom-brady">Quarterback: <em>Tom Brady</em></h4>

<p>One year removed from being crowned the league MVP, Tom Brady is still very much an elite player. That being said, his play has regressed a bit. His deep ball accuracy percentage sunk downward from 46.5% to 43%. His passing yards per attempt has dropped by about three-tenths of a yard. He&rsquo;s also scored fewer touchdowns this year, opting to throw slightly more interceptions instead.</p>

<p>But the question that needs to be asked here is whether this regression can be attributed to Brady aging or his fellow teammates failing him. And honestly, it&rsquo;s a difficult question to answer. Tom Brady is past retirement age, so he&rsquo;s long overdue for a downfall, but the Patriots skill players are no longer these weapons that can reliably produce. Chris Hogan is no longer the slasher he was the last couple of years. Nor is Rob Gronkowski anywhere close to being a dominant tight end anymore. Brandin Cooks being shipped off to Los Angeles didn&rsquo;t help things either, as the offense lacked a deep receiving threat to start the season. Midway through the year, it seems the Patriots finally found that trusted deep threat in Josh Gordon, but the man&rsquo;s personal demons were too much for the team to handle. So without Gordon, the Patriots are back in the same situation they were in at the beginning of the season.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-james-white-julian-edelman">Offensive Weapons: <em>James White, Julian Edelman</em></h4>

<p>As the only player to have garnered over 1000 yards from scrimmage this season, James White deserves top billing on this list. The Patriots love their wheel routes and no other halfback on this team runs those routes as smoothly as James White.</p>

<p>Likewise, Julian Edelman deserves to be on this list as well, simply for being Brady&rsquo;s favorite receiver. Brady truly thrives when he has a receiver that can run all sorts of directions from the slot position. Over the years, Edelman and Brady have developed a rapport that no other current receiver on the team can match. That relationship will be critical if the Patriots are to reach the conference championships.</p>

<p>Now&hellip;notice Gronk is not on this list?  Well, this year may have been Rob Gronkowski&rsquo;s worst year in football, statistically speaking. For a guy that was averaging over 76 yards a game for the past five years, his 52.5 yards per game this year is shockingly low. Furthermore, scoring only 3 touchdowns over 13 games is not a good stat for a man that was heralded as one of the league&rsquo;s best red zone weapons. It&rsquo;s become clear to many people that Gronkowski is no longer the beast he was in years past, running amok along the middle of the field while undersized defensive backs tried hopelessly to keep him contained. And as a result, he can no longer be counted on as a dependable offensive weapon.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-trey-flowers">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Trey Flowers</em></h4>

<p>For the second year in a row, Trey Flowers has been the team&rsquo;s star at rushing the quarterback. With 20 quarterback hits and 32 solo tackles, Flowers has made his presence known in quite a few games this season.</p>

<p>The only other edge rusher worth consideration here is Deatrich Wise Jr. But numbers alone are sufficient to come to a conclusion here. Last year, the man posted 19 quarterback hits, 5 sacks, and 16 solo tackles. This year, he only notched 16 quarterback hits, 4.5 sacks, and 15 solo tackles. If I did not consider him to be an elite pass rusher last year, why the hell would I consider him one this year when the numbers paint a weaker picture?</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>The Patriots roll into the postseason with several new faces, but the major players on the team are all well-versed in playoff football. The only major starters lacking playoff experience are running backs Sony Michel and Cordarrelle Patterson, corner Jason McCourty, and left tackle Trent Brown.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-bill-belichick-hc-josh-mcdaniels-oc">Coach: <em>Bill Belichick (HC), Josh McDaniels (OC),</em></h4>

<p>The wunderkind Sean McVay is definitely a great coach, if simply for making Jared Goff look like an MVP candidate for a couple weeks. With the right personnel, his offensive schemes produces excellent results. Likewise, Wade Phillips is a fantastic defensive coordinator in his own right. Even if his unit has not been anything worth raving about this year, the man holds distinction as a defensive mastermind. So I trust the Rams are in good hands with these two leading the team.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>In years past, the Patriots were almost always Super Bowl contenders. This year is a different story. With a pedestrian defense and a reduced offense, the Patriots may not even win one playoff game this year.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Chiefs Playoff Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Chiefs have emerged from nowhere and seized the top seed in the American Football Conference, thanks largely to the future MVP playing at quarterback - Patrick Mahomes.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-patrick-mahomes">Quarterback: <em>Patrick Mahomes</em></h4>

<p>As the prospective MVP of the season, no question is Patrick Mahomes an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-tyreek-hill-travis-kelce">Offensive Weapons: <em>Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce</em></h4>

<p>Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce were spectacular last year, but even better this year now that a truly elite quarterback was at the helm of the offense. Both easily broke past the millenium yard mark on route to scoring double-digit touchdowns this year.</p>

<p>If Kareem Hunt was still in the fold here, the Chiefs would be stacked in terms of offensive weaponry. However, booting him off the team left them without a reliable backfield option. Without a rusher that can both run and pass the ball, the team only has two notable dimensions of attack on offense. Even though Mahomes is capable of running the ball himself, his rushes and scrambles have been kept at a minimal rate this season, which leaves me with some doubt as to whether the team can safely rely on his ability to run the ball in order to move the chains.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-dee-ford-chris-jones-justin-houston">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Dee Ford, Chris Jones, Justin Houston</em></h4>

<p>The Chiefs are irrefutably the one team in the AFC with the best set of pass rushers. Before the season started, I would have been floored at the notion of Justin Houston only being the <em>third</em> best pressure defender on the team&hellip; but the reality is that Dee Ford and Chris Jones have taken major leaps forward this year when it comes to rushing the passer, each having logged  30 hits on opposing quarterbacks this season.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Justin Houston &ldquo;merely&rdquo; registered 15 quarterback hits this season and 28 solo tackles, but the man only played in 12 games this season. If you were to extrapolate his numbers over a 16-game period, Houston would doubtlessly be labelled elite.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>The Chiefs are fine here. All the key players here have postseason experience&hellip;except for one - Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes sat on the bench last year when the Chiefs lost their playoff opener against the Titans, so this year will actually be the first year Patrick sees real action in the postseason. I do not foresee this being much of a problem, though&hellip;the man has more than lived up to his billing as the starting quarterback this year. Nerves will rattle him at the start, but he&rsquo;ll shake them off fairly quickly.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-andy-reid-hc-eric-bieniemy-oc-bob-sutton-dc">Coach: <em>Andy Reid (HC), Eric Bieniemy (OC) Bob Sutton (DC)</em></h4>

<p>Andy Reid has always been a top-tier coach the past several years. Nothing this season has changed that. If anything, I respect Reid even more now, having brought out phenomenal performances from the young Mahomes so early into his career. The time he spends mentoring his quarterback during games has paid off in dividends, as it seems Patrick has continued to develop throughout the season, even as defenses began working harder to limit his game.</p>

<p>Bob Sutton, meanwhile, has been a bit of a mixed bag. The defensive line has taken some massive strides forward this year&hellip;but at the expense of the secondary. Kansas City may have one of the worst defensive backfields in the league. The team&rsquo;s affinity for man coverage schemes only exacerbates the shortcomings among the cornerbacks and safeties. But lately, the Chiefs have shown some considerable progress in coverage. Even though Seattle managed to post 38 points against this defense late in the season, the cornerbacks and safeties actually played well in that game. It was Russell Wilson&rsquo;s dime passing that allowed Seattle to produce so much on offense.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>Super Bowl favorites, easily. The Chiefs are likely the team to beat should any of the other teams with promise want to hoist the Lombardi Trophy this year.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Eagles Playoff Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>With a little help from the Bears, the Eagles have slipped back into the playoffs as the bottom seed in the National Football Conference. Will Nick&rsquo;s BD work its magic again this year?</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-nick-foles-nate-sudfeld">Quarterback: <em>Nick Foles / Nate Sudfeld</em></h4>

<p>Nick Foles seems like an elite quarterback. Watching film from yesterday&rsquo;s game against the Redskins, I saw him looking off zone defenders, taking whatever opportunities were available to him, and throwing the ball with a little touch in order to hit his receivers in stride.</p>

<p>But the man didn&rsquo;t throw a single deep ball in yesterday&rsquo;s game. His longest play was an 18-yard sideline pass to Alshon Jeffery. And I wonder if it&rsquo;s related to injuries related to a rib shot he sustained last week against Houston. If his ribs are truly an issue, than Nick will have a tough time surviving this postseason -  the hits will continue to mount for Foles as opposing pass rushers will likely dominate a weakened Eagles offensive line. And if his play is hindered in any way, the Eagles lose whatever hope they have left to go far into the playoffs.</p>

<p>Worse yet, if Foles were to ever be knocked out of a game, then Nate Sudfeld will be forced to take the reigns of the offense. The Eagles might be better off waving a white flag at that point.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-alshon-jeffery-zach-ertz">Offensive Weapons: <em>Alshon Jeffery, Zach Ertz</em></h4>

<p>Jeffery and Ertz are the two most important skill players on the team. Jeffery in particular seems to be more valuable than Ertz at this point. Despite Ertz&rsquo;s historic season and sure hands, something tells me Foles has more of a liking for Jeffery and his ability to outmuscle defensive backs for the football.</p>

<p>On a bit of a side note, If there&rsquo;s one area in which this year&rsquo;s Eagles differ the most from last year&rsquo;s Eagles, it&rsquo;s offensive weaponry. The championship team from last year could also count on Nelson Agholor in the slot and a strong rushing attack led by Jay Ajayi, in addition to Zach Ertz and Alshon Jeffery. All those weapons were critical in helping Foles play at an unbelievably elite level heading into the Super Bowl. This year though&hellip;Agholor has regressed back to mediocrity and not a single running back has come even close to matching the rushing numbers from last year. It&rsquo;s not only injuries that have wrecked the ground game - the entire offensive line seemed to have taken a gigantic step backward in terms of run-blocking. Watching several of their games this season, I noticed there were too many times halfbacks were met in the backfield by opposing defenders. I remember noting early in the season that generic blitzes were killing this offensive line. I&rsquo;m sure things have improved, but it&rsquo;s worrisome that an offensive line coming off a banner year would find themselves struggling with basic blitz concepts.</p>

<p>But there is hope for Philly - Josh Adams seems to be impressing in the ground game, albeit in spurts. And against Washington, the interior of the offensive line was actually able to generate push on a consistent basis. Still though, I&rsquo;m going to play things cautiously here and assume that this team is not ready to hang its hat on Adams yet - for any halfback to be considered a significant offensive weapon, I need to see sustained success against decent teams. So if Philly can run the ball with some success against Chicago and New Orleans&hellip;then I&rsquo;ll be adding Josh Adams&rsquo; name to this list.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-michael-bennett-fletcher-cox">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Michael Bennett, Fletcher Cox</em></h4>

<p>Both Michael Bennett and Fletcher Cox have been lighting up opposing quarterbacks all season. Bennett has been an especially impressive addition to the roster this year, taking the mantle of chief edge rusher away from the disappointing Brandon Graham. Fletcher Cox, meanwhile, is still up to his old ways, racking up roughly 35 quarterback hits over the course of the season.</p>

<p>An argument could be made that Chris Long should be added to the list. His 20 quarterback hits is above that of other edge rushers I consider elite, such as Melvin Ingram. Still, his mundane tackling and  numbers paint a different picture.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>Normally, playoff inexperience should be no concern to the reigning Super Bowl champions, but most of the starting defensive backs will be playing in the postseason for the first time. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the corners are a bit rattled initially against Chicago, especially given that it&rsquo;s a road game.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-doug-pederson-hc-mike-groh-oc-jim-schwartz-dc">Coach: <em>Doug Pederson (HC), Mike Groh (OC), Jim Schwartz (DC)</em></h4>

<p>Doug Pederson has proved himself after going on a Super Bowl run with a team that was racked with injuries. Likewise, Jim Schwartz is a proven commodity at defensive coordinator. So there should be no doubt that the coaching staff here is talented.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>Believe it or not, the Eagles could actually reach the Super Bowl. Yeah, I said it&hellip;the Eagles could end up as NFC champions yet again. <strong>BUT&hellip;</strong><em>only if  Nick Foles remains healthy.</em> If Foles is seriously injured at any point during the postseason, the Eagles will be cleaning out their lockers pretty damn soon afterwards. Guaranteed.</p>

	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>My favorite holiday of the year. Not because of the turkey or the food or anything, fuck that. It&rsquo;s all about having the day off to make bets on three consecutive primetime football games.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look through each game and find some bets to like. I feel good about these slate of games too.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="chicago-bears-detroit-lions-2-5-point-total-43-5">Chicago Bears @ Detroit Lions (+2.5) (Point Total: 43.5)</h4>

<p>The spread cleared below the key number of 3 earlier today as word finally got around that Mitch Trubisky was highly unlikely to play.</p>

<p>But would that really change much? Mitch Trubisky hasn&rsquo;t exactly been lighting the world on fire, despite what his raw numbers may initially indicate. His passing performance has been panned by analytical outlets and respectable commentators alike. What has been his saving grace has been his ability to run circles around defenders. And Chase Daniel doesn&rsquo;t have that talent, unfortunately. Nor is he much of a passer, obviously.</p>

<p>The Bears can still put up points courtesy of some fantastic scripted plays from Matt Nagy, but even he can only draw up so many plays before that well of creativity dries up.</p>

<p>Seems like a good time to bet on the Lions, no? Except the Lions will now be missing the services of <strong>both</strong> Marvin Jones and Kerryon Johnson. Kenny Galliday and Theo Riddick will now be the bellcows of Detroit&rsquo;s passing attack. And I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s enough to keep this game competitive against the NFL&rsquo;s best defense.</p>

<p>That under is looking sexy though&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Bet: Under 43.5</strong></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="washington-redskins-dallas-cowboys-7-point-total-40-5">Washington Redskins @ Dallas Cowboys (-7) (Point Total: 40.5)</h4>

<p>The books seem to think the Redskins will take a step back after Alex Smith&rsquo;s tragic season-ending injury last week. But Alex Smith was never a solid fit in the offensive system Jay Gruden was trying to institute. Colt McCoy, on the other hand, has demonstrated some comfort in Gruden&rsquo;s system. So it&rsquo;s very possible (even likely) that Washington will actually perform better with Colt McCoy at the helm of the offense. In fact, the offense actually came alive a bit when Colt stepped in - his first pass was a touchdown throw to Jordan Reed.</p>

<p>On top of that, these Cowboys are a little overrated. That win over the Falcons last week was driven mostly by Ezekiel Elliott. And unlike Atlanta&rsquo;s bottom-ranked defense, the Redskins defense have the chops to limit the havoc he wreaks. Not to mention the Redskins boast a bunch of quality pass rushers that can force the easily-flustered Dak Prescott into throwing some bad passes.</p>

<p><strong>Bets: Redskins +7, Redskins ML, &amp; Michael Gallup to Score a TD</strong></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="atlanta-falcons-new-orleans-saints-13-point-total-59-5">Atlanta Falcons @ New Orleans Saints (-13) (Point Total: 59.5)</h4>

<p>I went into some length in a <a href="https://www.owlpicks.com/posts/reviewing-atlanta-s-loss-against-the-cowboys/" title="post">post</a> yesterday about why the Falcons stand a good chance of covering against the Saints. Towards the end of that post, I also alluded to the fact that both teams should be able to feast against one another. Atlanta is struggling badly against the run, which bodes well for a Saints team that loves to pound the ball on the ground. But at the same time, the Saints defense isn&rsquo;t really anything special. While their run defense has been quite good so far, their pass rush and secondary needs some work. I already spoke at length about their pass rush in <a href="https://www.owlpicks.com/posts/reviewing-atlanta-s-loss-against-the-cowboys/">yesterday&rsquo;s post</a>, so let me just quickly discuss the secondary here. Marcus Lattimore was absolutely phenomenal last year as a rookie defensive back. But this year, he&rsquo;s clearly lost some of his magic. Eli Apple is shaping up into a decent cornerback, but he&rsquo;s only one man in a secondary now ridden with holes everywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>Bets: Falcons +13 &amp; Over 59.5</strong></p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Reviewing Atlanta&#39;s Loss Against the Cowboys</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>To nudge myself out of the funk I was in Sunday night, when I barely missed hitting a lucrative five-team parlay (may the gods smite Kirk Cousins for the rest of his life), I decided to review game tape from the Falcons loss to the Cowboys earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Two major takeaways&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Matt Ryan found himself flustered by Dallas&rsquo; pass rush, especially when they blitzed. His worst throws of the day came against blitzes.</li>
<li>The Falcons have serious issues bottling up opposing rushers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those two reasons are why the Falcons fell to Dallas. While Atlanta stands little chance of making it to the postseason, it&rsquo;s still worth taking note of their advantages and shortcomings so that we can continue betting on their remaining games this season. Speaking of which&hellip;this Thanksgiving, the dirty birds will be traveling to New Orleans to face off against the Saints&hellip;<em>as 13-point underdogs</em>. Think of that - the Falcons as double-digit underdogs, despite Matt Ryan playing comparatively well.</p>

<p>So the question becomes whether the Saints are likely to cover. And honestly, I&rsquo;d say no.</p>

<p>First off, it&rsquo;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.owlpicks.com/games/12/">my Elo spread</a> and the Vegas spread have <strong>finally</strong> drifted apart. It took quite a few blowouts, but the books have finally begun inflating the Saints&rsquo; handicap in anticipation of the public inevitably coming in heavy on them.  So we know the line for this game is a little skewed.</p>

<p>But really, where the Falcons gain an edge here is in pass protection. The absolute best way to stall Matt Ryan is to field a strong pass rush augmented with well-timed blitzes. The Cowboys have the horses to pull that off - New Orleans, not so much. Despite some positive numbers from Sheldon Rankins and their first-round rookie, Marcus Davenport, the reality is that the Saints should be producing much more pressure given that their opponents are playing from behind so much of the damn time. The Eagles from last year are a textbook example of ramping up the pressure when playing with a lead.</p>

<p>Now New Orleans boasts a powerful ground game that will expose the Falcons and their soft run defense. Still, Atlanta should be able to eat as well in this game, making this spread just a tad bit too ridiculous for my liking.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 11 - Risky Propositions</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>In this series, I&rsquo;ll details bets that are a little risky for my blood.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="panthers-lions">Panthers @ Lions</h5>

<p>Such a beautiful spot for the Lions here. Coming off three embarrassing losses, Detroit is primed to play better now that they&rsquo;ve returned back home and their season is on the line. And last week&rsquo;s game against Chicago shows me that the team can defend against the run when it&rsquo;s a central focus of their defensive game plan. Snacks Harrison manning the nose position has brought their rush defense up a notch.</p>

<p>If the Panthers cannot run the ball with reckless abandon here, Carolina may actually struggle to move the chains, let alone put up points. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a terrible bet to put some money on the Lions here, but <em>Marvin Jones</em> will be ruled out of the game on injury. The offense was gimpy without Golden Tate, but now you take their best receiver off the field as well? Too risky.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="cowboys-falcons">Cowboys @ Falcons</h5>

<p>The Falcons were depressing last week. Matt Ryan loses a step as a passer whenever he plays outside a dome. On top of that, that defense was carved up by Baker Mayfield and his skill players.</p>

<p>Now, the Falcons are currently fielding the league&rsquo;s worst run defense, on a yards-per-carry basis. But in fairness, that dishonor can be attributed to a 92-yard run Nick Chubb ripped off for a touchdown last week. Take away that play and the Falcons would instead be ranked as the tenth worst team against the run. Still, the point is that Atlanta is susceptible against the rush, which should be sweet music to a Cowboys team that rediscovered their ground game last week against the Eagles. If Ezekiel Elliott was able to chew off 150 yards on 20 carries at Philadelphia in primetime, the man should be ready to feast again on a Falcons defense that&rsquo;s equally inept at defending the run.</p>

<p>Then again, the Falcons do have one thing going for them - the fact that the team plays a few orders of magnitude better within the confines of their dome. In particular, take Matt Ryan - his passes see much more air in Atlanta than anywhere else. Likewise, I&rsquo;d think that defense plays with more energy in front of their home crowd. So it&rsquo;s a bit difficult to take a side here, especially when Dak Prescott insists on playing stupid from time to time.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 11 - Solid Bets</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>All right, so the Supercontest is a lost cause. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m treading water at exactly 50%. Statistically, I&rsquo;m no better than a coin. A fucking coin.</p>

<p>But at the very least, each season offers up lessons for me to internalize. I like to believe I improve as a bettor every year. To be honest though, my best year as a sports gambler has been the first year I&rsquo;ve actually started wagering serious money. Sooner or later, I will eventually match my sensational performance from that year.</p>

<p>Until then&hellip;week 11.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="vikings-2-5-bears"><em>Vikings (+2.5)</em> @ Bears</h5>

<p>The few outlets and NFL writers I respect have all sided with Minnesota here. And I will too.</p>

<p>Mitchell Trubisky is overrated. Analytical outfits continue to trash him week after week, despite his glowing passer rating. Careful observers have noted Trubisky&rsquo;s shortcomings, particularly against the blitz. And Mike Zimmer, as one of the best defensive minds in the game, has a history of exposing bad quarterbacks.</p>

<p>So at the very least, expect the Bears offense to finally stall this week, despite Matt Nagy&rsquo;s best attempts to scheme around a quarterback with limited ability.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="buccaneers-giants-2-5">Buccaneers @ <em>Giants (-2.5)</em></h5>

<p>The Buccaneers are losers. To rack up over 500-ish yards on offense only to post 3 measly points&hellip;it&rsquo;s pathetic. The Buccaneers are a damn mess on offense. Neither Jameis nor Fitzpatrick are serving the team well.</p>

<p>The Giants on the other hand have stepped up their game last week. Sure, Eli Manning was not as impressive as his statistics from last week may imply&hellip;but Eli still managed to finish drives, one of which won the game.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay should be able to score a few times in the game, but I expect the Giants to rack up even more points. Reviewing the game tape from last week, it seems Tampa Bay is happily content playing a soft zone defense. And these defenses tend to be exposed by offenses fielding a solid bunch of receivers. So the Giants have no excuse to lose this game in their quest to win out the rest of the season.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="eagles-saints-8-5">Eagles @ <em>Saints (-8.5)</em></h5>

<p>Seems odd to see the reigning Super Bowl champions be such heavy underdogs. But the Elo model thinks it&rsquo;s well-deserved.</p>

<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m shocked that the sportsbooks haven&rsquo;t set the line even higher, considering the Saints are coming off three consecutive covers against solid competition. I&rsquo;d honestly expect the books to set the line a little higher than usual in order to pull underdog money against such an elite team. Either the books are fine pricing the Saints appropriately or the spread is kept lower than usual to entice bets on a public darling in the Saints. If the latter is the case, that means the books are taking a chance on the Eagles here in this match. And that&rsquo;s a risky proposition in my book.</p>

<p>The Eagles are far from being that team that took the league by storm last year. Michael Lombardi gave me some phenomenal insights in his observations about the team. Last season, the team was converting third downs at an unbelievable clip.  This season, statistical regression finally reared its ugly head - Philadelphia is struggling to overcome third-down from six yards and out. Worse yet, the Eagles cannot run the ball, leading to their offense being one-dimensional. A pass-only offense is not necessarily a terrible thing so long as the quarterback has several weapons reliably catching his passes, but Philly&rsquo;s even lacking horses there. Nelson Agholor has regressed to mediocre form while Alshon Jeffery has been hampered by injury for much of the season.</p>

<p>To be fair, their acquisition of Golden Tate should even things out a bit, but I honestly wonder whether that would be enough to keep pace with the league&rsquo;s hottest team on their home soil.</p>

			<p>Good week last week from a betting perspective, even if two of my Supercontest picks were losers. A superteaser hit landed me a pretty penny. Anyway&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="saints-6-bengals"><em>Saints (-6)</em> @ Bengals</h5>

<p>Give me the Saints all day long.</p>

<p>The Bengals biggest problem on offense has always been that they lack reliable weapons that have won over the trust of their quarterback, Andy Dalton. And now you tell me his <em>most trusted receiver in AJ Green</em> is out? I couldn&rsquo;t care less about Joe Mixon - AJ Green is fundamentally integral to this offense. Without him, Cincinnatti&rsquo;s passing game loses much more than just a step.</p>

<p>The only thing that worries me is this potentially being a let-down spot for the Saints after two momentous wins against NFC heavyweights. But I&rsquo;ll chance it here with one of the NFL&rsquo;s more prolific offenses.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="falcons-5-browns"><em>Falcons (-5)</em> @ Browns</h5>

<p>I respect the Falcons and I respect their potent offense. But I disrespect the Browns so much more. The Browns had all the emotional fuel last week to cover against as 8-point underdogs against the Chiefs&hellip;and they still blow it.</p>

<p>The Browns will lose, with or without Hue Jackson. Losing is in their DNA this season. And even better, Gregg Williams seems intent on making sure the team stays true to their destiny this year.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="patriots-titans-6-5">Patriots @ <em>Titans (+6.5)</em></h5>

<p>Sure, the Titans come into this contest a little banged up off a short week, but I&rsquo;ll take my chances with Marcus Mariota and Mike Vrabel in Tennessee. This year&rsquo;s Patriots are not as intimidating as the Patriots of last year. More importantly, the team has played decisively worse on the road than at home.</p>

<p>The game will be decided on whether the Titans offensive line can hold Trey Flowers, Adrian Clayborn, and Deatrich Wise long enough for Marcus Mariota to throw some dimes.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="jaguars-colts-3">Jaguars @ <em>Colts (-3)</em></h5>

<p>Interesting line. I used to be a big fan of the Jaguars earlier in the season, especially after they stomped the Patriots and Jets early in the season. But after that Chiefs game, the team has turned into an unmitigated disaster. Blake Bortles has regressed to joke form, the defense is tussling with one another in the locker room, defensive backs are doing some incredibly stupid things off the field, the coaches are not even fully aware of the injury situations of their starters&hellip;</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Colts are on the up-and-up, having lit up the scoreboards the last two weeks (albeit against incredibly poor competition). Two positive games hint at a trend, but a third solid game tells me that the team is for real. Given that Indy has Andrew Luck at quarterback and Frank Reich as head coach, I do believe this Colts team is for real.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="cowboys-eagles-6-5">Cowboys @ <em>Eagles (-6.5)</em></h5>

<p>Not the biggest fan of this pick, but the Supercontest mandates I pick five games a week, and I like to pick teams led by a good head coach and a good quarterback. It also helps that the Eagles boast one of the best set of pass rushers in the league. And I&rsquo;d much rather side with Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham matching up against a beleaguered Cowboys offensive front and a struggling quarterback.</p>

<p>Then again, I&rsquo;m not liking these Eagles players constantly chirping about their distaste for the Cowboys. You&rsquo;re only giving Dallas more emotional fodder by being so public with your trash talk of the Ladyboys here.</p>
