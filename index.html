			<h2 id="giants-lions">Giants @ Lions</h2>

<p>Why does Pat Shurmur run on 2nd and long? Why is this a thing in the NFL?</p>

<p>Giants run defense once again choking up yardage to opposing rushers.</p>

<p>Jones is rough. The kid is still holding on to balls recklessly. And Shurmur telegraphing run plays doesn&rsquo;t help the situation.</p>

<p>Giants offensive playbook seems to favor high-low routes where a receiver runs a slant route to the outside while the inside receiver crosses underneath to the flat. Daniel Jones seems to prefer throwing to the deeper receiver, even in tight coverage.</p>

<p>Darius Slayton may be a beast in the making for the Giants. Finally, something worthy of taking that Hakeem Nicks role.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="eagles-bills">Eagles @ Bills</h2>

<p>Josh Allen&rsquo;s ability to run is really tasking these coverage defenders patrolling the flat. The threat of Josh Allen scrambling has these defenders dropping off their assignments.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="browns-patriots">Browns @ Patriots</h2>

<p>Greedy Williams and Denzel Ward playing well in their return.</p>

<p>Once again, the Browns shooting themselves in the foot with penalties.</p>

<p>New England&rsquo;s passing offense is definitely suspect. It seems the team only found consistent success through their screen game and improvisational plays. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the defense, the game would have been competitive well into the fourth quarter.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-chiefs">Packers @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>More blitzing by the Chiefs linebackers and safeties leading to positive results.</p>

<p>Lots of window dressing before the snap serving the Chiefs well, confusing this Packers defense. It also helps that the Packers are regularly overcompensating in their coverage on Tyreek Hill.</p>

<p>The Chiefs&rsquo; linebackers are liabilities in coverage, particularly in 5-wide situations.</p>

<p>The creative plays that were sustaining the Chiefs early in the game have largely disappeared. Reid only drew up so many of them, apparently. Late game magic for the Chiefs largely boils down to the quarterback&rsquo;s ability to create plays.</p>

<p>Rodgers has taken over the offensive play-calling in closing out the game, which indicates to me that LaFleur is reluctantly (but correctly) allowing his quarterback to call the shots when need be.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chargers-bears">Chargers @ Bears</h2>

<p>Soldier Field has some slippery turf. Good coaches like Sean Payton are well aware of this and advise their players to wear better cleats. Bad coaches like Anthony Lynn aren&rsquo;t quite as sharp though.</p>

<p>Interesting coverage defense by the Bears on a third down. Showed blitz, only for defenders to back out away from the line of scrimmage leaving only three people to rush the passer. These defenders backing away took away the crossing routes two of the Chargers skill players were running though.</p>

<p>Joey Bosa making key plays in the first quarter alone.</p>

<p>Chargers defense on long third downs is a truly a spectacle in failure.</p>

<p>Chicago&rsquo;s offensive line is showing some serious symptoms of incompetency.</p>

<p>The Chargers offensive line is just as bad.</p>

<p>Kudos to Trubisky for completing a few big plays, but the Bears red zone offense is truly pathetic. It seems Nagy doesn&rsquo;t full trust his quarterback in goal-to-go situations either. Not to mention it doesn&rsquo;t help that Mitch no longer runs around like he used to.</p>

<p>To the Bears credit, their offense found themselves in the red zone on five different occasions in the first half. And yet, not a single touchdown was scored. Sure, Trubisky could be to blame for the offense&rsquo;s ineptitude for the red zone, but I&rsquo;m also seeing Matt Nagy&rsquo;s gimmick plays and goal-to-go plays fail to move the ball past the goal line. This Bears offense is hopeless if it needs to rely on Trubisky dropping back to pass, which seems more and more to be the case as teams have gotten a beat on the exotic plays the Bears like to run.</p>

<p>The Bears finally strung together a quality touchdown drive, mainly by calling 6 straight runs and then using some drive momentum on a deep throw to Allen Robinson. Chargers seem to have issues bottling up the run.</p>

<p>Bears like their zone coverage in this game. Fine by Rivers, he&rsquo;s not having many problems here. So long as the Chargers hold up in pass protection, Rivers can operate here.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jets-jaguars">Jets @ Jaguars</h2>

<p>Jacksonville roasted the Jets with an inside run against an 8-man box. Not a good sign for New York.</p>

<p>Jaguars soft zone defense not doing much of anything.</p>

<p>Jets smartly using quick plays on offense to matriculate the ball downfield.</p>

<p>Minshew working his magic and delivering a perfect ball on a scramble away from pressure.</p>

<p>The Jets left tackle is a liability.</p>

<p>Jets cornerbacks are affording receivers too much space on blitz situations.</p>

<p>Minshew doing well reading Gregg Williams&rsquo; blitz schemes.</p>

<p>Ever since giving up a big run to Fournette on that early run, the Jets run defense has been stout.</p>

<p>The entire Jets offensive line is a major liability in pass protection. Only the right tackle seems somewhat qualified to be playing in the professional league here.</p>

<p>Two fumbles by the Jaguars on special teams. Sloppy.</p>

<p>Jets blitz pick-up is still lame. But Gase is starting to adjust late in the game by calling quick passes and occasional gadget plays to keep the heat off Darnold.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="dolphins-steelers">Dolphins @ Steelers</h2>

<p>Miami willing to gamble. The defense tried a jailbreak blitz on a 3rd-and-20 in order to push the Steelers out of field goal range. Instead, Mason Rudolph was able to hit a short crosser for a long-developing 45-yard touchdown.</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick a major gambler, even under pressure. No surprise.</p>

<p>Rudolph developing a taste for Juju Smith-Schuster.</p>

<p>Miami&rsquo;s defensive backs are liabilities in coverage. Pair that with one of the weaker defensive lines in the league and you have a pretty shitty defense.</p>

<p>Deceptive blitz by the Jaguars forced a bad throw from Darnold on a short field.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="buccaneers-titans">Buccaneers @ Titans</h2>

<p>On the first drive, the Buccaneers could have scored. But two bad decisions by Winston killed any chance at a touchdown. The first bad decision came when he tried to force a throw to Mike Evans under heavy coverage. The second bad decision was not diagnosing man-to-man coverage before the snap and throwing to his tight end crossing the formation over.</p>

<p>Jameis messing up a snap ends up giving the Titans a goal-to-go touchdown.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay loves running between their tackles on zone schemes.</p>

<p>Ryan Tannehill isn&rsquo;t immune to bad quarterback play either. Some of his first quarter decisions have already been questionable. Not to mention his anticipation needs to be called into question.</p>

<p>In part due to a tip, Winston throws another interception that gifts the Titans with yet another goal-to-go touchdown.</p>

<p>Why do the Titans have fade routes in their red zone package?</p>

<p>Jameis under pressure has been unusually good.</p>

			<h2 id="cardinals-giants">Cardinals @ Giants</h2>

<p>Chase Edmonds is a beast at halfback. Good vision and acceleration.</p>

<p>Cardinals are actually incorporating a good number of run plays into their offensive playbooks. Some balance is being maintained here, which is telling. It honestly seems Kingsbury&rsquo;s Air Raid experiment may have come to an end here. Even though no team runs more 10 personnel sets than the Cardinals, the fact that Arizona is willfully running the ball on a regular basis violates one of the core tenets of the Air Raid philosophy.</p>

<p>Defensive line for the Cardinals had their moment here. Eight sacks and multiple quarterback hits, mostly thanks to Daniel Jones insisting on holding the ball longer than he should, even on plays that are not developing as intended.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-bears">Saints @ Bears</h2>

<p>Mitchell Trubisky throwing deep is a strategy primed for failure. Trubisky needs to be taught to play smarter and take yardage whenever it avails itself.</p>

<p>What am I saying? MVP Mitch is irredeemable.</p>

<p>Teddy Bridgewater throwing the ball away when plays don&rsquo;t develop as expected. Not ideal, but more quarterbacks need to be doing this instead of playing hero ball.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-colts">Texans @ Colts</h2>

<p>Penalties, penalties, penalties&hellip;.the Texans have been victimized on multiple drives by penalties.</p>

<p>Jacoby Brissett made one clutch throw under duress and almost completed a second one under major pressure from JJ Watt.</p>

<p>The Texans&rsquo; backup right tackle is simply horrendous. Pressure on a three-man rush is a major red flag.</p>

<p>The Colts defense looks to be pretty disciplined here, given the way a defensive lineman disrupted a tight end from running a leak route out of play action.</p>

<p>Pierre Desir is definitely a solid cornerback for the Colts here, holding DeAndre Hopkins to limited receptions in key moments.</p>

<p>Nobody on this Texans team hit the quarterback more than once outside of JJ Watt. It&rsquo;s concerning, especially for a team that&rsquo;s not that solidly coached in the first place. If this game made one thing clear, it&rsquo;s that Watt is the only elite pass rusher on this squad as of this week.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-lions">Vikings @ Lions</h2>

<p>Dalvin Cook is one slippery fuck. And the Vikings knows it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="dolphins-bills">Dolphins @ Bills</h2>

<p>Slow linebacker coverage from the Dolphins resulted in a big play from a Bills fullback - Patrick DiMarco.</p>

<p>Josh Allen&rsquo;s deep throws are fueled more by prayer than accuracy. Ryan Fitzpatrick has thrown a dime though early, slinging a ball to a receiver in between a cornerback and safety.</p>

<p>Dolphins play a decent amount of man coverage.</p>

<p>Miami&rsquo;s strength on offense seems to be the inside run game, according to their offensive coordinator. Not so coincidentally, the Dolphins have two big runs up the middle in the first quarter alone.</p>

<p>Bad decision-making by Josh Allen costs his team potentially 4 extra points. Still, Allen did put his team in position for the field goal by taking advantage of the Dolphins&rsquo; poor coverage discipline on a critical third down.</p>

<p>Dolphins seem adamant on running the ball even against eight-man boxes.</p>

<p>Another fantastic dime pass from Fitzpatrick into triple coverage.</p>

<p>Ryan Lewis may be a point of weakness in Miami&rsquo;s secondary.</p>

<p>Miami&rsquo;s play-action fakes tend to lead to throws outside the numbers, interestingly enough.</p>

<p>Edward Oliver a big player on this Bills defensive line, especially against the run.</p>

<p>Tre&rsquo;Davious White is something special, both in pass coverage and against the rush.</p>

			<h4 id="patriots-jets-9-5">Patriots @ <em>Jets</em> (+9.5)</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard going against the Patriots here, but give me a Jets team that found a second life with the return of Sam Darnold last week. It also helps that C.J. Mosley <em>should</em> be coming back into the fold here after spending the last several weeks sidelined with injury.</p>

<p>Besides, it helps that New York&rsquo;s coaches should be better prepared in this match, having faced off against New England just a few weeks ago. On the flip side, the Patriots will have a harder time preparing for a Jets team with a new signal caller that hasn&rsquo;t played much this year.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="vikings-lions-1">Vikings @ <em>Lions</em> (+1)</h4>

<p>Kirk Cousins has been having a few good weeks, but I expect his run to end against a Lions team that can hold up respectably against a good passing game. In fact, Detroit has become one of the best overall teams in the league this year, with little fanfare. The Lions&rsquo; defensive backs should be able to limit Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielan in man coverage. Likewise, Stafford&rsquo;s tendency to throw beyond the sticks should fare well against a Vikings defensive backfield that&rsquo;s lost some of its edge this year.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="texans-colts-1"><em>Texans</em> @ Colts (-1)</h4>

<p>Even though these Texans were spanked by the Colts in their most recent match-up, I feel it&rsquo;s not fair to lay the entire blame for that loss at Bill O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s feet. Sure, his coaching was pretty suspect last season, but Watson was clearly wrecked with anxiety during his playoff debut. His shaky nerves reared itself at the worst moments.</p>

<p>But if you go back further than that and look at the two games between these teams during the regular season, both teams are closer to one another than the coaching disparities would otherwise indicate. And this year, it&rsquo;s fair to say the Texans have dramatically improved while the Colts are struggling to string winning performances together with Jacoby Brissett helming their offense. Houston&rsquo;s improvements have come largely on coaching and the injury front, both areas that held the team back last year.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="chargers-titans-2-5">Chargers @ <em>Titans</em> (-2.5)</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little odd for me to be favoring a team with a questionable quarterback situation, especially against a respected veteran like Philip Rivers. But the reality is that these Chargers are a lame bunch. Nothing sums up their hopelessness better than the fact that their defense leads the league in missed tackles. It&rsquo;s a stat that highlights their laziness and shoddy play.</p>

<p>And even Philip Rivers could only do so much - last week, the Chargers lost at home against a Steelers team led by a third-string quarterback whose best quality may be his duck calling. And this week, the Chargers have to travel across three time zones to face off against one of the league&rsquo;s best defenses. I don&rsquo;t expect a pretty game, but I do see Ryan Tannehill stringing together enough plays and doing just enough to lead these Titans to a much-needed win.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="rams-falcons-3"><em>Rams</em> @ Falcons (+3)</h4>

<p>Why am I taking these Rams again? The 49ers exposed the fraudulent nature of this team just last week.</p>

<p>But unlike San Francisco, Atlanta lacks the defensive horsepower to really limit the Rams&rsquo; offensive schemes. Even if Atlanta adopts the same strategy most other defenses have been using against the Rams, the defense lacks the talent up front to really limit any gains Los Angeles can make.</p>

<p>Besides, both teams are playing in desperation mode. While Dan Quinn probably has more on the line here than Sean McVay, I trust McVay more in this spot to adjust accordingly and lead his team to victory.</p>

			<h2 id="seahawks-browns">Seahawks @ Browns</h2>

<p>The Browns are just hot garbage, starting with Baker Mayfield.</p>

<p>To start, Baker threw two passes behind his receivers that ended up being picked. He also threw another interception early in the game that stunted some of the momentum the Browns built up out of the gate. Nick Chubb also fumbled the ball on another critical drive during the second half.</p>

<p>The coaching on a Browns drive that ended at the Seahawks goal line was atrocious. Freddie Kitchens made a series of bumbling moves on that drive, calling a fade pass on a 3rd down and then calling a bizarre-looking slant on 4th down. Despite the weird play on 4th down, Cleveland was bailed out  thanks to the Seattle defense committing a silly pre-snap penalty. But then Kitchens proceeded to throw the challenge flag as <em>his team ran their second 4th down play</em>. It was a challenge that ultimately failed, but then the Browns clumsily tried running the same play from before, only to be shut out from the end zone as the Seattle defense adjusted once Cleveland showed their hand earlier before.</p>

<p>The Seahawks were able to exert their will over the Browns defense, mostly on the ground. Chris Carson was a force, breaking tackles and churning out additional yards after contact. Cleveland needs to be more disciplined in their tackling. Some conditioning would also help as well.</p>

<p>Penalties were still an issue for this team, though a few of the penalties charged against the Browns looked a little spurious.</p>

<p>I have to stop picking bad teams unless those teams are taking more than 3 points.</p>

<p>Only thing worth praising for the Browns are their scripted play. It was those plays that led to Cleveland taking a double-digit lead halfway through the game.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="49ers-rams">49ers @ Rams</h2>

<p>I should be more wary of teams that can win in dominating fashion without much help from their quarterback. This Niners team is something special, even if Jimmy Garoppalo is off every now and then.</p>

<p>Man coverage isn&rsquo;t doing much against these 49ers. Kyle Shanahan is countering the Rams defensive coverage looks with bunch formations, from the few plays I did get a good look at.</p>

<p>The 49ers defense have hit their stride. Their aggressive man coverage and trench play is paying off in spades today.</p>

<p>Kyle Shanahan is pathologically conservative once he has a safe lead.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="eagles-vikings">Eagles @ Vikings</h2>

<p>The Vikings were able to make hay on the first drive through some end-around trickery and outside runs. Eagles defensive line also having a hard time pressuring Cousins on the drive.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing going in favor for the Eagles defense, it&rsquo;s that the front is holding up well against inside runs between the tackles.</p>

<p>Three straight runs for the Eagles offense, leading to a three-and-out on their first drive. The writing is on the wall, for fuck&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<p>Two drives - Cousins hasn&rsquo;t been all too impressive outside of one throw to Thielan down the middle of the field. Eagles having trouble getting pressure with their standard personnel however&hellip;which helps.</p>

<p>Jason Peters not playing left tackle may be a serious liability for the Eagles.</p>

<p>Outside runs are a serious problem for this Eagles front seven.</p>

<p>Finally, Kirk Cousins is discovering the deep ball again. Two home run balls to Stefon Diggs to put his Vikings up over 20 points. Main takeaway here is that Kirk Cousins has rediscovered his former penchant for the big play. Pretty similar to what I saw last year when the Vikings played Philadelphia at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>

<p>Eagles playing a good amount of zone defense.</p>

<p>Finally, Vikings are breaking out in the second half. Kirk Cousins making passes under pressure and the team finally using their two best skill players in creative and purposeful ways.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-chiefs">Texans @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Patrick Mahomes&rsquo; first pass was to Tyreek Hill.</p>

<p>Chiefs matriculated the ball pretty well on one drive. Using window dressing to make an inside run for a big gain, taking advantage of the amount of cushion the Texans are giving Tyreek Hill, and Mahomes even bringing back some of his magic with a lob to Travis Kelce under duress.</p>

<p>But the Texans returned the favor with a touchdown of their own. And that touchdown was more or less gotten through running the ball. The Chiefs are still unable to stop the run.</p>

<p>Bad deep ball from Patrick Mahomes resulting in his first interception of the season. It seems that ankle is more serious than was previously thought&hellip;he&rsquo;s not turning properly into his throws, though he does pass more like a baseball pitcher than an actual football quarterback anyway.</p>

<p>Just poor defense from the Chiefs. How do you let a halfback leak out run a wheel route out of the backfield without assigning anybody to him in coverage?</p>

<p>Tashuan Gipson is a weak point for the Texans secondary.</p>

<p>Chiefs&rsquo; pass rush is laughable.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="lions-packers">Lions @ Packers</h2>

<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t get the Lions. Start off with a flea flicker and a set of passes in order to throw the Packers off guard. Manage to post 13 points in the first 20 or so minutes of the game, but only 9 points the rest of the way, though.</p>

<p>Detroit&rsquo;s offense failed down the stretch. Their play-calling was uninspiring and predictable. Heavy formations almost always led to power run plays that the Packers were able to shut down fairly effectively. Spread formations usually led to passing plays in which receivers were expected to win against solid man coverage defenders without much scheming help. It seems the Lions offense expected much more success against these Packer corners. But in the end of the day, the Packers won on the backs of their defense.</p>

<p>The Lions were only able to finish in the end zone on one of their six scoring drives. The other scores came in the form of field goals that were ultimately not enough to win the game. The Packers defense stepped up their play at all three levels and kept this Lions offense under wraps after a disastrous first quarter.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-jaguars">Saints @ Jaguars</h2>

<p>Saints flashed some creative defensive coverages at Gardner Minshew. On one play, they baited Minshew into throwing to a receiver that ended up being in bracket coverage. On another play, linebackers threatened to blitz up the middle, only to drop away when the ball was snapped. Instead, it was two cornerbacks that ended up blitzing Minshew, one of whom was lined up along the trenches and the other lined up across a receiver. And on another play, Saints showed a man-underneath coverage that actually turned into zone coverage when the Jaguars tried to stack receivers.</p>

<p>Fournette seems to be a liability in pass coverage.</p>

			<h5 id="49ers-rams-3">49ers @ <em>Rams</em> (-3)</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little alarming to me that the books consider the 49ers and the Rams as (more or less) equal. One team has a better quarterback than the other. And that should make the difference here, more or less.</p>

<p>I see Wade Phillips stacking the box in order to stop the run game. Sure, his defensive backs will be left on their own against the 49ers&rsquo; skill players, but that&rsquo;s a gamble I&rsquo;m sure Wade is willing to take. The combination of Marcus Peters, Aqib Talib, Eric Weddle, and Taylor Rapp should be enough to keep an underperforming quarterback at bay.</p>

<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s defense will likely follow what other teams have done and try to stack the line of scrimmage in order to prevent the Rams from running their outside zone scheme. And sure, that&rsquo;ll work. But McVay&rsquo;s unit has still made a little hay in the run game, simply by running between the tackles instead. So Los Angeles has a workaround here that should help them sustain drives, even against the 49ers stout defensive front.</p>

<p><strong>Postmortem:</strong> The 49ers did not do what I expected from them. Instead of overloading the front on defense, San Francisco opted to stay with their regular four-man look. And it still worked. The 49ers defensive line reduced Jared Goff into a nervous wreck. The Rams have serious issues along their offensive line. And without any solid pass protection, Jared Goff has been exposed this season. I don&rsquo;t see the Rams as a viable playoff team anymore.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="seahawks-browns-1-5">Seahawks @ <em>Browns</em> (+1.5)</h5>

<p>The Browns have no business winning this game, according to the metrics. And yet, Freddie Kitchens and his team of characters will find a way to steal a win here and keep their Super Bowl delusions alive.</p>

<p>The reality here is that as bad as Freddie Kitchens has been so far this season, Pete Carroll hasn&rsquo;t been that much better. The Seahawks&rsquo; head coach has likely grown too old for the game - his approach is a little too stubborn and outdated for today&rsquo;s game. Teams shouldn&rsquo;t be emphasizing the run game over the pass game anymore. And yet, Carroll (and Zimmer) seem to think otherwise.</p>

<p>So give me the desperate (but not completely inept) Freddie Kitchens here over the aging Pete Carroll and a Seahawks team traveling across two time zones. It also helps that Steve Wilks has considerable experience facing off against this Seahawks team.</p>

<p><strong>Postmortem:</strong> It took four bloody turnovers for the Seahawks to close out this match with a win. If Baker played with just a bit more composure, Cleveland could have walked into their bye week with an ugly win. I don&rsquo;t regret this pick at all.</p>

<p>Also, Steve Wilks blows. I deserve to be dropkicked for using Steve Wilks to justify a pick.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="texans-chiefs-4-5">Texans @ <em>Chiefs</em> (-4.5)</h5>

<p>A little bit of a risky pick given Deshaun Watson and his penchant for late game heroic. But a Chiefs team coming off a loss and expecting the return of its deep threat in Tyreek Hill gives me faith here.</p>

<p>What really sells me on this pick is that Andy Reid faced off against this Texans squad just 2 years back. In that game, Alex Smith had a ball of a time throwing dimes all over the field against a weak Houston secondary. Fast forward to now and not much has changed. Houston&rsquo;s defense is still pathetic in the backfield. Romeo Crennel hasn&rsquo;t really changed his coverage schemes much. And I expect that to bite them in the ass yet again in Arrowhead.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>On second thought, after watching tape of that game back in 2017, I&rsquo;m not so impressed by the Chiefs&rsquo; offense against the Texans defense. Despite losing two of its three best pass rushers early in the game, Houston was able to force Kansas City into a number of third-and-long situations. The problem  was that the Chiefs were able to convert on most of those plays, despite the odds being against them. Some of those conversions came because of soft coverage on the part of the Texans, but other conversions came thanks to some great improvisational play by Alex Smith and Travis Kelce being a one-man wrecking crew. Either way, Kansas City&rsquo;s largely owes its offensive success to some terrific performances by a few key players - strategy only amounted to so much. Andy Reid doesn&rsquo;t have the Texans figured out like I originally assumed.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="eagles-vikings-3"><em>Eagles</em> @ Vikings (-3)</h5>

<p>The Vikings are just <em>so</em> damn childish with their emphasis on running the ball on early downs. And it&rsquo;s this stubborn devotion to the run that&rsquo;ll be their undoing against teams that can adapt against formulaic opponents. The Eagles under Jim Schwartz and Doug Pederson are one of those teams.</p>

<p>Besides, I&rsquo;d rather trust Carson Wentz over Kirk Cousins.</p>

<p><strong>Postmortem:</strong> The Eagles have lost their pass rushing edge. And without that ability to rush the passer effectively, Philadelphia&rsquo;s entire defensive backfield has been exposed. The Vikings had a ball of a time airing out the ball against a hopeless Eagles secondary. Kirk Cousins finally rekindled things with Stefon Diggs, though I still have my doubts about whether their relationship can survive road trips&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="titans-broncos-2">Titans @ <em>Broncos</em> (-2)</h5>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m falling for a trap here, but the Broncos being such short favorites against another formulaic team in the Titans seems wrong to me. Granted, the Broncos defense isn&rsquo;t built as well as the Bills defense that stoned the Tennessee offense last week, but Vic Fangio should prepare this team well against a Titans team that identifies as a run-first unit.</p>

<p><strong>Postmortem:</strong> Mariota is trash. I&rsquo;m so happy I called this one correctly.</p>

			<h2 id="vikings-giants">Vikings @ Giants</h2>

<p>Zimmer cannot still shake off his pathological conservative nature on offense. On a 3rd &amp; 20 play in the red zone, Zimmer opted for the shotgun draw.</p>

<p>Jabrill Peppers has been beastly against the run today.</p>

<p>Giants zone defense is simply lousy, as expected.</p>

<p>Dalvin Cook is something special.</p>

<p>Daniel Jones seems to genuinely enjoy throwing outside the numbers, even against tight coverage. The Giants need more X-style receivers that could catch those contested balls.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-cowboys">Packers @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>Read-option slants aren&rsquo;t the best option against man coverage, Cowboys.</p>

<p>The Packers two starting cornerbacks (Jaire Alexander and Kevin King) along with the team&rsquo;s two starting edge rushers (Preston Smith and Za&rsquo;Darius Smith) are truly something. Those four players form the foundation for one of the NFL&rsquo;s better defenses.</p>

<p>The Packers defense has an affinity for dime coverages on passing downs, leaving them a little vulnerable against opposing rushers. If only the Cowboys recognized this&hellip;</p>

<p>Garrett has little juice.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="colts-chiefs">Colts @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Colts have a hard time working out of negative game script.</p>

<p>Colts are shameless in their commitment to the run, but it&rsquo;s working. The Chiefs and their scrub defense are no match for a cohesive Indianapolis front - the Colts offensive line are winning the battle in the trenches.</p>

<p>Mahomes is stripped of his magic due to a limp. He&rsquo;s still making some pretty passes though.</p>

<p>Frank Reich is one of the best coaches in the league. To take a team decimated by injuries into incredibly hostile territory and to win outright as double-digit underdogs is impressive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="buccaneers-saints">Buccaneers @ Saints</h2>

<p>Jameis Winston is an amalgamation of good and bad quarterbacking. As simple as that.</p>

<p>Saints maintaining balance between the run and the pass, despite Tampa Bay supposedly being much better at defending the run compared to the pass.</p>

<p>Ronald Jones is quite the speedster halfback for Tampa Bay.</p>

<p>Bucs seem content prioritizing the run over the passing game, at least for a few first-half drives.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay seems almost powerless against Michael Thomas.</p>

<p>Teddy Bridgewater showing development, throwing deep on several occasions against a rather weak Tampa Bay secondary.</p>

<p>Winston making bad decisions and erratic throws against this Saints. It&rsquo;s almost as if this team has him shook. Either that or playing his second straight road game has taken the edge off his quarterbacking.</p>

<p>This referee crew seems far more lenient when it comes to pass interference.</p>

<p>Once again, Tampa Bay has sold itself on the run being more important than the pass in this game. Quite interesting considering the number of receiving weapons the team boasts on offense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bears-vs-raiders-london">Bears vs Raiders (London)</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear the Bears didn&rsquo;t really give much of a shit to prepare for this game. Sloppy play on both sides of the ball, the Raiders making hay mostly by rushing Josh Jacobs and throwing short passes, flying into London late into the week&hellip;all these things indicate that Chicago was content trying to wing this game. I feel like a damn fool picking the Bears here. Let it be known that an underprepared team is a likely loser.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="browns-49ers">Browns @ 49ers</h2>

<p>Cleveland making some serious hay with some brilliantly-executed misdirection plays.</p>

<p>But once a funk sets in, this Browns team deflates quickly.</p>

<p>The 49ers chewing up a lot of yardage with that outside zone rushing attack. I wonder if the same game plan that teams use to attack the Rams will apply here with the 49ers.</p>

<p>Garoppolo has been frankly disappointing. Need to see him carry a game for once against a respectable team.</p>

<p>Baker honestly has issues seeing open receivers. I wonder if throws up the middle are all the more difficult now that it&rsquo;s been confirmed that Baker cannot see past the line of scrimmage at times.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-bengals">Cardinals @ Bengals</h2>

<p>Cardinals cannot seemingly stop Joe Mixon from running between the tackles. One of the Bengals&rsquo; successful drives was predicated on Mixon being able to run all over the Cardinals.</p>

<p>Finally, some ballsiness by the Cardinals to go for a 4th down on a goal-to-go situation. Before that though, Arizona was able to matriculate down the field with designed runs, surprisingly. Seems as if the Cardinals are seeing the light and committing more to the run.</p>

			<h2 id="jaguars-broncos">Jaguars @ Broncos</h2>

<p>Jaguar linebackers not playing disciplined against misdirection plays.</p>

<p>Jacksonville doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much of a red zone playbook.</p>

<p>Jalen Ramsey&rsquo;s understudy not doing all too well. But in his defense, the Broncos were able to move the ball on him thanks largely to some well-drawn plays.</p>

<p>Those plays involved wide receivers running crossing routes on third down in order to create space for a halfback coming out of the backfield, running play-action off a heavy formation, and then motioning a tailback away from the pocket in order to create a throwing lane up the seam for Flacco.</p>

<p>The Jaguars&rsquo; offensive tackles are points of weakness.</p>

<p>Fournette was able to chew off some serious yardage early in the second half behind the I-formation fullback runs.</p>

<p>Minshew is magical with his elusiveness in the pocket.</p>

<p>Timely zone blitz by the Jaguars to end a critical Broncos drive.</p>

<p>Minshew magic is a real thing. This whole team ups its game when Minshew magic is in effect.</p>

<p>Zone blitzes throw off the Broncos and their attempt to dump off passes to leaking halfbacks.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-saints">Cowboys @ Saints</h2>

<p>The Saints should have a hard time running their offense from a negative game script, given Bridgewater is more a game manager than anything else.</p>

			<h2 id="titans-jaguars">Titans @ Jaguars</h2>

<p>The Jaguars insist on running a zone coverage scheme that forces their linebackers to run around the field and even blanket receivers at times. It&rsquo;s not good when Jacksonville has a slow bunch of linebackers outside of Myles Jack.</p>

<p>Jacksonville is still trying to build an offensive identity around Leonard Fournette instead of the passing game. The Titans are keying in on Fournette though, stalling the Jaguars anemic offense.</p>

<p>Mariota sucks.</p>

<p>The Titans will run that ball with reckless abandon until it works, dammit.</p>

<p>Minshew seems to like throwing his deep balls outside the numbers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ravens-chiefs">Ravens @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>The Chiefs are hopeless at rushing the passer. Chris Jones is the only quality pass rusher on that team. Frank Clark hasn&rsquo;t been living up to his billing.</p>

<p>Michael Lombardi may be right - this Ravens offense has a hard time recovering from negative plays.</p>

<p>Once again, horrendous clock management from Andy Reid as the first half winds down.</p>

<p>Gus Edwards has been beastly, breaking tackles and accelerating quickly.</p>

<p>Ravens offense adjusted in the second half by hammering the ball on the ground. First drive was nothing but runs. It&rsquo;s clear the Chiefs prioritized defending the pass here.</p>

<p>Chiefs should have covered. But two lucky heaves by Lamar Jackson kept the Ravens within one score. Goddammit. Ravens are a team with fight though.</p>

<p>Cameron Irving is a point of weakness along that Chiefs offensive line.</p>

<p>The Chiefs may have issues picking up delay and zone blitzes, similar to what I saw last year when Kansas City faced the Patriots before the Super Bowl.</p>

<p>Add overload blitzes to the short list of issues dragging these Chiefs down. Even against five and six-man fronts, the Chiefs offensive line tends to slide protection towards one direction, usually letting one defender come free from the opposite edge. Usually, Kansas counters this by dumping the ball off on the halfback leaking out of the backfield.</p>

<p>The Ravens won the battle in the trenches throughout the game with creative blitz concepts. Of the times that Mahomes was left with a clean pocket, I noticed that play-action and quarterback roll-outs were used on a few of those plays.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="lions-eagles">Lions @ Eagles</h2>

<p>Outside zone runs may be effective against Detroit&rsquo;s bigger, slower front.</p>

<p>Detroit runs quite a bit of 11 personnel for a team that&rsquo;s reputedly run-heavy.</p>

<p>Philly&rsquo;s secondary is lousy. Darby especially has lost some of his touch. Not good when the top cornerback on your roster fails to perform adequately.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="giants-buccaneers">Giants @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Daniel Jones can run with the ball. Offensive playbook even has designed runs for him.</p>

<p>Janoris Jenkins is not an elite corner.</p>

<p>In the second half, Giants defense has shifted to a two-safety look with man coverage underneath. It seems to be enough to keep Jameis from moving the ball on them at will.</p>

<p>Also worth noting - Jameis sucks. Buccaneers need to get rid of him. Maybe even trade up for Justin Herbert or whatever his name is.</p>

<p>Winston would be murdered by a team with a solid pass rush, the way he holds on to the ball. His pocket presence is horrendous.</p>

<p>Shaq Barrett something special. Buccaneers made a solid pick-up in free agency here.</p>

<p>Daniel Jones holds on to the ball like a damn fool too.</p>

<p>Buccaneers playing prevent defense on the Giants on the last drive was their downfall. Credit to Daniel Jones for picking apart their weak defensive scheme. And credit to the Giants for stunting the Buccaneers&rsquo; offense somehow. I need to review tape here&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-browns">Rams @ Browns</h2>

<p>Browns have serious issues guarding shifty receivers.</p>

<p>Cooper Kupp is the best receiver on the Rams.</p>

<p>Wade Phillips adjusted quickly on defense. Rams defense were embarrassed on a long third down when a blitz left them helpless to defend against a halfback screen. The second time the Browns tried to pull off the same trick, a linebacker shadowed the Browns tailback and took him down before the screen was even set.</p>

<p>Browns made a bizarre call on a fourth and long, calling a draw run. Just idiotic.</p>

<p>Goff&rsquo;s play clock management on the road is just poor. Waiting too long to call for the snap. Nearly cost the Rams a first down when McVay called a time-out immediately before the ball was snapped on what actually ended up being a successful throw to move the chains.</p>

<p>Baker Mayfield having to hold on to the ball and manufacture a play is not a pretty sight. Plays have to unfold like they&rsquo;re drawn up in order for the Browns signal caller to be successful.</p>

<p>The Browns lack any creative red zone plays to try and make an emergency touchdown.</p>

<p>Once again, the Browns&rsquo; lack of discipline at preventing penalties kept some Ram drives alive or more fruitful.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-chargers">Texans @ Chargers</h2>

<p>Texans secondary is still incredibly problematic. The off coverage in particular is worrying.</p>

<p>DJ Reader stepping up as a solid pass rusher.</p>

<p>Gus Bradley does not have much of a taste for blitzes, apparently. In fact, he may have more of a liking for three-man rushes than for blitzes, sadly.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="panthers-cardinals">Panthers @ Cardinals</h2>

<p>Kyler Murray being able to run off the read option seems to be an important part of the Cardinals offense.</p>

<p>Cardinals seem to be more prone to using wide receiver screens as part of their otherwise barebones red zone package.</p>

<p>Kyle Allen playing well, especially under pressure. Keeps his eyes down the field.</p>

<p>Carolina has a package of reverses in their offensive repertoire. One example is a two-layered wide receiver sweep.</p>

<p>Mario Addison with a timely sack to end a Cardinal drive.</p>

<p>Arizona is lousy at defending tight ends.</p>

<p>Kyle Allen&rsquo;s first two touchdowns came from traditional drop-back plays. Impressive.</p>

<p>Carolina&rsquo;s secondary is playing very well. Quite disciplined in their zone coverage.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="broncos-packers">Broncos @ Packers</h2>

<p>Broncos love their three-man rushes, for some stupid reason.</p>

<p>Flacco not showing any confidence by abandoning the pocket early on a critical third down.</p>

<p>Garrett Bolles could have cost the team a touchdown.</p>
