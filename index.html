			<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Matthew Stafford</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Kenny Golladay (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Kerryon Johnson (RB), Marvin Jones (WR), Danny Amendola (WR), T.J. Hockenson (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Darius Slay (CB), Trey Flowers (DE), Damon Harrison (DT), Mike Daniels (DT)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Bob Quinn (GM), Matt Patricia (HC), Darrell Bevell (New OC), Paul Pasqualoni (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Despite hiring a new offensive coordinator to helm the offense, the Lions didn’t flip much at the position group level, only replacing the coaches overseeing the quarterbacks and running backs.</p>

<p>On defense, things have remained mostly intact from last year.</p>

<hr />

<p>Last year was a disappointment. Matt Patricia came in and took a very eccentric approach to the way he conducted things as a head coach, even going as far as telling a beat reporter to sit up straight at a press conference. And now this year, the man is proud to have his team straight up touted as the Detroit Patriots, given all the things he’s done to emulate the Patriots’ approach to football and team-building. Apparently, Patricia doesn’t understand that emulating a winning formula is not enough to actually build a winning team. Every organization must foster their own culture and develop their own way of doing things in order to succeed. It’s fine to borrow elements from other organizations, but to cop another team’s style entirely smacks of naivete.</p>

<p>Besides that, Matt Patricia also gambled on the run game last year, opting to make his Lions a run-first team. It wasn’t a prudent decision. Detroit bottomed out of the division in his first year as a head coach. In his defense, one could argue that the Lions lack the raw talent necessary to engineer a dominant rushing attack. But does that even matter? In today’s game, it should be obvious that the air game is so much more valuable compared to the run game. So prioritizing the latter at the expense of the former once again smacks of naivete.</p>

<p>This year, the Lions may see a bit more life on offense under new offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell, but let’s not forget Bevell was run out of Seattle for good reason. Bevell had a strange playbook that mixed good and bad concepts in equal parts. That inconsistency makes failure a very real possibility here. The defense doesn’t seem much better, though it’s worth noting that since scooping up Mike Daniels, the Lions now feature one of the league’s heavier defensive fronts. That should bode well against other teams that need to rush the ball to open up the offense.</p>

<p>All things said, I have a hard time finding positive things worth mentioning about this team. Matt Patricia may be a good coordinator, but his actions as a head coach leaves me baffled. I cannot be high on a team when its head coach perplexes me. Expect a losing season here. It’s very possible for the team to end up as a bottom feeder as well.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-2"><strong><em>Tier 2</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Kirk Cousins</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Adam Thielen (WR), Stefon Diggs (WR), Dalvin Cook (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Kyle Rudolph (TE), Ameer Abdullah (RB), Chad Beebe (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Everson Griffen (DE), Danielle Hunter (DE), Linval Joseph (DT), Anthony Barr (LB), Anthony Kendricks (LB), Harrison Smith (SS), Xavier Rhodes (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Rick Spielman (GM), Mike Zimmer (HC), Kevin Stefanski/Gary Kubiak (New OC), George Edwards (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Even though the interim offensive coordinator has been formally hired into his role this year, things are significantly different on offense. I suspect that’s mostly because of Gary Kubiak coming onboard as an offense guru and the assistant head coach under Mike Zimmer. Other than the running backs coach and an offensive line assistant, the entire staff has been replaced from last year.</p>

<p>On defense, however, things have remained the same. The only change has come with the addition of Terence Newman as an assistant defensive backs coach. While Newman didn’t exactly light the world on fire as a cornerback, the former player understands the finer aspects of Zimmer’s system and has the experience needed to mentor younger defensive backs.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Vikings last year had their postseason hopes dashed due to some awkward performances from Kirk Cousins, some horrendous pass protection from an underwhelming offensive line, and some bad coaching from then offensive coordinator John DeFilippo. Mike Zimmer thankfully fired DeFilippo near the end of the season the moment it became obvious that the team could not count on him to coach a consistently viable offense. In his place went Kevin Stefanski, who impressed enough to keep his job this year, even as the team brought Gary Kubiak onboard as an advisor.</p>

<p>Honestly, now that I look at this Vikings team&hellip;.I’m looking at a Super Bowl contender here. Minnesota has the makings of a championship team - a solid coaching staff, a roster loaded with quality players across the board, a franchise quarterback, and a respectable home field advantage.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the team is without weak points. One major downside that concerns me is the offensive line - Minnesota lacks any decent depth along the trenches on offense. Even though the Vikings spent a first-round draft pick this year on a center, it’s still going to take some time for the rookie to get up to speed. Furthermore, the Vikings released most of their guards from last year, leaving them cripplingly thin along the interior of the line. The signing of Josh Kline and the drafting of Dru Samia provides some superficial depth, but one injury along the line could cause havoc and trigger a reshuffling, in which linemen will once again be forced to play out of their natural positions in a desperate attempt to field a workable offensive line. Kirk Cousins would suffer the most if the Vikings are forced to reorganize the offensive line, as the man needs all the help he can get.</p>

<p>We also see some major overhaul along the offensive coaching staff, courtesy of Gary Kubiak. It usually takes some time for a new coaching staff to synergize with the players. But new coaching regimes have taken teams to the Super Bowl before. It does help to have a strong defense that can back up an offense still adjusting to a new scheme. Not only that, but Kubiak has won a Super Bowl in his own right with the Broncos several years ago. So I wouldn’t be too worried about the new offensive coaches here - they should be able to find their bearings sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>I expect this team to win the North and contend with the Eagles and the Saints for the NFC crown.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-5"><strong><em>Tier 5</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Aaron Rodgers</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Davante Adams (WR), Aaron Rodgers (Mobile QB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Aaron Jones (RB), Jimmy Graham (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Za’Darius Smith (DT/LB), Preston Smith (OLB), Rashan Gary (OLB), Adrian Amos (SS), Jaire Alexander (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Brian Gutekunst (GM), Matt LaFleur (New HC), Nathaniel Hackett (New OC), Mike Pettine (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, only the running backs coach from last year managed to survive the Packers’ transition away from the Mike McCarthy era.</p>

<p>On defense, even though Mike Pettine was retained as the defensive coordinator, most of the assistants underneath him have been flipped. Only the defensive line coach and the secondaries coach have been kept from last year. Interestingly enough, none of the defensive coaches have been designated as run game or pass game coordinators - it seems the end of the McCarthy era means no more defensive sub-coordinators to complicate the coaching structure.</p>

<hr />

<p>Note that the Packers are favored to end the season on a winning record. I find that fascinating.</p>

<p>On one hand, it’s not that difficult to make a great case for the Packers doing well this year. Aaron Rodgers is still one of the best quarterbacks in the game, injuries be damned. The defensive roster this year better reflects Mike Pettine’s vision of an ideal defense. Matt LaFleur’s approach to offensive football is refreshingly different from that of Mike McCarthy’s.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, pessimists can make the argument that all these coaching, philosophical, and personnel changes are too much for any team to grasp in the matter of a few months - in other words, it’ll take time for these Packers to bond with one another, let alone adopt a new style of offense that’s significantly different from the offense they’ve been running over the last several years under McCarthy.</p>

<p>The pessimist argument rings truer to me then the optimist’s outlook. Sure, I’m more inclined towards arguments that sow doubt over hope&hellip;but the reality is that the Packers have made so many dramatic changes heading into this season. All these new parts that were brought into the fold this year need some time to settle into place. So expect a slow start followed by steady improvement. A postseason berth is not completely impossible here, but it’s going to require some serious misfortune befalling on their division rivals and the emergence of a second wide receiver that can complement Davante Adams.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-8"><strong><em>Tier 8</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Case Keenum, Dwayne Haskins</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>N/A</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Jordan Reed (TE), Vernon Davis (TE), Josh Doctson (WR), Adrian Peterson (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Matt Ioannidis (DE), Montez Sweat (OLB), Ryan Kerrigan (OLB), Landon Collins (SS), Josh Norman (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Bruce Allen (GM/Exec), Jay Gruden (HC), Kevin O’Connell (New OC), Greg Manusky (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, we have a peculiar situation. The offensive coordinator from last year has been demoted to an offensive assistant this year. In his former role goes last year’s quarterbacks coach, Kevin O’Connell. O’Connell is apparently a bit of a rising star within the organization. All the other coaches on the offensive staff have been retained, save for Wes Phillips, who likely left the organization voluntarily to join his pal Sean McVay and his dad Wade Phillips over in Los Angeles. In his place goes a new face that wasn’t on the team before.</p>

<p>On defense, Greg Manusky managed to keep his job and most of his staff. The inside linebackers and defensive backs coaches from last year have both been replaced this year with veteran coaches that have served as coordinators, albeit with muddled degrees of success.</p>

<hr />

<p>These Redskins are a goddamn mess. Frankly, I’ll be gobsmacked if this team doesn’t end the season with one of the worst records (if not <strong><em>the</em></strong> worst record).</p>

<p>One thing that baffles me is their decision to demote last year’s offensive coordinator instead of outright firing him. Why keep your old offensive coordinator around in a lesser role? Not only is it demoralizing, but that move potentially jeopardizes any efforts by the team’s senior management to bring harmony back into the organization after a disastrous season last year.</p>

<p>On defense, things are only slightly better from a coaching perspective. Greg Manusky managed to survive despite his defense’s sorry performances last year. However, the Redskins brain trust are trying to help him by hiring two veteran coaches in Rob Ryan and Ray Horton. Both men will serve under Manusky as position coaches and thankfully not as assistant coordinators - neither have succeeded as coordinators themselves. If these three coaches could actually function well together, this defense may actually be serviceable for once. But with Rob Ryan having a bit of a history as a firebrand and Ray Horton not having had much success in his most recent stints, I can’t be certain that these defensive coaches will sync with one another.</p>

<p>Beyond coaching, things don’t get much better. On offense, the Redskins look less like a professional football team and more like a war-torn country. Neither Case Keenum nor Dwayne Haskins look ready to assume control of the offense. That offensive line is in shambles, especially now that Trent Williams seems intent on holding out indefinitely out of concern for his health. And worst of all, Washington lacks any notable skill players. Notice that I didn’t name even a single player as a definitive vector on offense. The Redskins are the only team that lack reliable playmakers on offense. Instead, we have an assortment of players that have only showed up every now and then. If two of the skill players manage to break out as reliable producers, I’ll be impressed, especially given the team’s sad situation at quarterback.</p>

<p>The defense isn’t that bad, but it isn’t necessarily good either. Questions remain about whether this defense can bounce back after a disastrous season last year. The biggest question comes up front, as the defense lacks solid pass rushers now that Preston Smith left for greener pastures over in Wisconsin. Kerrigan cannot carry this pass rush by himself.</p>

<p>All that being said, I expect the Redskins to be one of the worst teams in football.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Eli Manning, Daniel Jones</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Sterling Shepard (WR), Saquon Barkley (RB), Golden Tate (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Evan Engram (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Janoris Jenkins (CB), Michael Thomas (FS), Jabrill Peppers (SS), Dalvin Tomlinson (DT)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Dave Gettleman (GM), Pat Shurmur (HC), Mike Shula (OC), James Bettcher (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>The Giants have kept their whole offensive coaching staff from last year.</p>

<p>On defense, only about half the coaches have been retained. The assistant linebackers coach and the two defensive backs coaches have been replaced this year, likely in an attempt to improve the lagging passing defense in a league predisposed to airing the ball out.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’ll actually be interesting to see how the Giants do this year. Despite Dave Gettleman’s criminal mismanagement of this organization, the roster still features some considerable talent. Pat Shurmur has kept many of his coaches from last year too, so nothing much changes from a schematic standpoint - players should have an easier time settling into their groove this year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Giants have a major problem at quarterback - Eli Manning. The man is a danger to this team. His unwillingness to throw the ball any further than ten yards severely limits the team’s potential on offense. And in today’s NFL, a team that cannot effectively air the ball out is doomed to failure. Listen, I love Eli and I’ll always cherish him for bringing two Super Bowl rings to the team. 2011 was the year I fell in love with football, and it was all because Eli single-handedly dragged these Giants to the championship that season. It was a season that forever cemented his legacy as a Giant great. But all great men fall victim to father time sooner or later - Manning is no different. His era has passed. It’s time for Daniel Jones to succeed him as the franchise quarterback.</p>

<p>That being said, it’ll take time for Jones to adjust to life in the NFL. Rookie quarterbacks almost never see immediate success their first year in the league. And according to the experts, Jones is still rough around the edges coming out of college - if so, then expect the man to take a year or two making quite a few mistakes as he hones his talents.</p>

<p>It also doesn’t help that the team is absolutely gutless at the pass rush. After dealing Olivier Vernon to the Browns, Gettleman has left this team completely bare along the edges of the defensive line. The hope here is that Lorenzo Carter and Markus Golden can serviceably fill in that void, what with the former having a full year of experience under his belt and the latter having thrived before under James Bettcher back when Bettcher was the defensive coordinator for the Cardinals. But we’ll need to wait and see whether this plan pans out.</p>

<p>You know what though&hellip;if there is one good thing to be said about New York’s defensive front, it’s that the Giants are fielding some big bodies along the trenches. B.J. Hill, Dalvin Tomlinson, and Dexter Lawrence lend some serious size to that defensive line, and that’ll be key at stopping opposing rushers from running buck wild up the middle.</p>

<p>The Giants are still rebuilding. That defense will need roughly two to three years to regain top form now that most of their major players from recent years past have been shipped out or unsigned. And that’s fine, as Daniel Jones will need a few seasons to sharpen his skills as a passer. It’s possible the team could pull as many as six wins this season, but expect nothing more than that.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-4"><strong><em>Tier 4</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Dak Prescott</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Ezekiel Elliott (RB), Amari Cooper (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Dak Prescott (Mobile QB), Randall Cobb (WR), Jason Witten (TE), Dak Prescott (Mobile QB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Demarcus Lawrence (DE), Robert Quinn (DE), Leighton Vander Esch (OLB), Jaylon Smith (MLB), Byron Jones (CB), Chidobe Awuzie (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Jerry Jones (GM), Jason Garrett (HC), Kellen Moore (New OC), Rod Marinelli (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, quarterbacks coach Kellen Moore was promoted this year to offensive coordinator, replacing the beleaguered Scott Linehan. Jon Kitna will take over his former position on the coaching staff.</p>

<p>On defense, nothing has changed from last year.</p>

<hr />

<p>I feel silly billing this team as Super Bowl contenders last year. Even though the Cowboys won the division and clawed their way to the division round in the postseason, it wasn’t an inspiring season to say the least. The Cowboys notched too many wins by slim margins last year - take away the game against Jacksonville and Dallas’ point differential for the season dips into the negatives.</p>

<p>A few good things have been done during the offseason. In an effort to turn around an offense that was stagnant for much of the season, the team wisely let Scott Linehan go. Kellen Moore has been promoted in his stead. And promisingly enough, Moore seems more willing to try new things this year, even giving lip service to this idea of letting Dak run around with the ball at times. It was a tactic that was glaringly missing from Linehan’s playbook last year. Still, I do have my doubts about whether Moore <em>is actually allowed</em> to unleash Dak if necessary - I’m not sure if Jason Garrett or Jerry Jones are able to tolerate the risk of Dak sustaining injury as he’s running around the field. Many folks were calling for more scramble plays last year too, but the Cowboys insisted on keeping Dak situated in the pocket.</p>

<p>And really, that leads me to the major issue at hand here - I question Jason Garrett as a head coach. Hell, I even question Jerry Jones as a general manager. Before the regular season even started last year, it was a known fact that the Cowboys were deficient on quality receivers. I thought the team’s brain trust was well aware of the issue and would find a fix early into the season. Instead, it took an expensive trade for Amari Cooper late into November to jump-start the air game. And Cooper, as talented as he may be, is only one man. Coming into this season, this team still hasn’t done much to alleviate their receiver concerns. Randall Cobb was brought into the ranks over from Green Bay, but I honestly see this as more a lateral move given Cole Beasley’s departure over the offseason. The only upward move may have been resigning the aging Jason Witten, though doubts linger about whether he can perform even passably after taking a year off from the game. On top of that, Sanjay Lal still remains the team’s wide receivers coach, despite overseeing a unit that fell far short of its potential last year.</p>

<p>But while question marks still persist on offense and coaching, the defense looks to be solid yet again this year. Consistency in personnel and coaching this year should help the defense settle back quicker into its groove this year. And even though that defensive front only has one elite talent in its ranks, Rod Marinelli seems to find ways to have that defensive line outperform the sum of its individual parts. More importantly, the back seven remains as strong as ever, headlined by the linebacking duo of Leighton Vander Esch and Jaylon Smith. It’s these two that set the tone for the rest of their comrades. Barring multiple injuries to key players, the defense should once again carry this team to a few wins.</p>

<p>So where do I stand here? I see the Cowboys as a middling team that could break into the postseason once more, depending on luck and whether Kellen Moore is allowed to weave more creativity into the offensive playbook. Or maybe it all depends on how hard Jason Garrett will be clapping when his team needs him the most&hellip;</p>

			<h2 id="tier-1"><strong><em>Tier 1</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Carson Wentz</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Zach Ertz (TE), Alshon Jeffery (WR), DeSean Jackson (WR), Miles Sanders (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Carson Wentz (Mobile QB), Jordan Howard (RB), Nelson Agholor (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Brandon Graham (DE), Fletcher Cox (DT), Malik Jackson (DT), Zach Brown (OLB), Ronald Darby (CB), Malcolm Jenkins (SS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Howie Roseman (GM), Doug Pederson (HC), Mike Groh (OC), Jim Schwartz (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Win Total:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>The Eagles last season had an odd coaching set-up on both sides of the ball, in that every major position group has at least two coaches overseeing them. Still, for the most part, the major offensive coaches from last year were retained this year, with the exception of the wide receivers coach.</p>

<p>On defense, only the defensive line coach has been replaced from last year, with Phillip Daniels now heading that group. It’s worth noting that former Dolphins defensive coordinator Matt Burke has now been brought on as an advisor to the defensive staff.</p>

<hr />

<p>The injury bug and the Super Bowl hangover depressed this team’s potential last year. It’s possible that Frank Reich’s departure also left a bit of a hole on offense that Mike Groh couldn’t quite patch up in his first year as the Eagles offensive coordinator. Even still, Philadelphia managed to fight their way to the division round of the playoffs before bowing out for the season.</p>

<p>Once again, Philly is stacked with talent. Not all the names listed above will be able to contribute significantly, but so long as some of those players live up to their billing and Wentz remains healthy, this team will be just fine. Speaking of which&hellip;.without Nick Foles backing him up, Carson Wentz is critical to the team’s success this season. Signs are there that the fourth-year quarterback will come through however. Last year, analytical outfits concluded that (despite not having any gaudy numbers) Wentz was actually better than he was the year before in what may be considered his <em>annus mirabilis</em> - his quarterbacking fundamentals and decision-making was so much more solid. Wentz should continue to be able to play at a high level.</p>

<p>One last point worth bringing up is the state of that defensive line, given that it is the heart and soul of this defense. And it thrives so long as snap counts for the linemen are carefully managed and star players are allowed to play at different positions along the line. And despite trading away Michael Bennett in the offseason, the Eagles still have four promising players lining up in the trenches. This should be one of the best defensive lines in the league this year, especially as that defensive backfield has the talent and wits to cover skill players long enough for the pass rush to hit home.</p>

<p>Given how weak the division looks, I expect a good year for Philadelphia. The Eagles should be able to break into double-digit win territory.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Derek Carr</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Jalen Richard (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Tyrell Williams (WR), Josh Jacobs (RB), Doug Martin (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Clelin Ferrell (DE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Mike Mayock (New GM), Jon Gruden (HC), Greg Olson (OC), Paul Guenther (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Aside from the running backs coach, the offensive coaching staff has been kept intact from last year. It&rsquo;s worth noting that this team has opted to keep Tom Cable around as the offensive line coach, despite his track record of failure. So not much is to be expected from the offensive line this year, putting even more pressure on an easily frightened Derek Carr.</p>

<p>On defense, we see a bit of reorganization. The defensive line coach from last year is now a senior assistant on the defensive staff. A new coach was hired to take on oversight duties over the defensive line. On a similar note, the senior assistant from last year will now be training the defensive backs exclusively - the old coach that managed the secondary has been sent packing.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once again, I was wrong last year. I truly believed Gruden would work his magic and turn the Raiders into a decent team. Instead, the man literally traded away two of his best players, leaving the roster truly bereft of any real talent outside of Jared Cook, who took his talents to an actual contender this year. Too many holes on the roster and a lack of identity led the Raiders to only four wins last year.</p>

<p>Before delving into the negatives, let’s start off on a positive note. Oakland did score a victory in the offseason by scooping Antonio Brown away from the Steelers in what literally was more a fire sale than an equitable trade. Despite his diva-like ways, Antonio Brown will be fundamentally critical to any success the Raiders see on offense. With Brown lining up for the offense, the Raiders can actually threaten opposing defenses, forcing them to commit too many resources to one player and thereby opening up opportunities for the other skill players running routes. Should Gruden be able to scheme well and Derek Carr be able to execute consistently enough, we could see some great performances this year from the likes of Tyrell Williams and Jalen Richard.</p>

<p>But those are big ifs that largely hinge on Gruden and his coaching ability. It’s funny that I write this just as Gruden has gone on record to state a growing affection for <em>Nathan Peterman,</em> of all players. The same Nathan Peterman that notoriously threw five interceptions in his first start ever in the NFL and has failed to redeem himself ever since. The same Nathan Peterman some claim to be the worst quarterback to ever start an NFL game. What does this say about Gruden and his grasp on reality? Maybe Gruden sees something in him I don’t? Then again&hellip;maybe it’s simpler than that - the man just doesn’t have an eye for talent. After all, shipping out proven players in Khalil Mack and Amari Cooper for draft picks were idiotic moves. And in fact, those moves look all the more foolish when you consider Oakland’s first draft pick this year was an overreach, according to some reputable analysts. Allegedly, the Raiders could have flipped the fourth pick for more draft value and still have ended up with the man they would have drafted anyway at that spot.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, their draft board emphasized men of character above most other factors. It’s a preference that I honestly find peculiar - this team went out of its way in the offseason to sign Vontaze Burfict and Richie Incognito, both players known for being dysfunctional jackasses. The latter has already been suspended two games this year for unprofessional conduct. So this whole idea of mixing impressionable rookies with veterans prone to reckless behavior doesn’t sound right to me. Once again, strange marriages like this hinge on Jon Gruden’s ability to lead, but his failure as a schemer and talent evaluator last year has me wary of his overall competence as a coach. Put simply, I’ve lost faith in Gruden.</p>

<p>But at the very least, the Raiders do have a better roster this year compared to last year’s. Even the defense is a slight step up, though not much has been done from a personnel standpoint in the offseason. The hope here is that the defensive players drafted last year are able to mesh into a functional defense this year, given all the action they’ve seen in their rookie seasons. It would also help if some of the defensive rookies drafted this year are able to contribute as well. So there’s a remote possibility that this defense may actually be serviceable.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>After an offseason full of needless drama, Antonio Brown is gone. The team released him after Brown publicly expressed a desire to leave the team. Honestly, it was a good move given the circumstances. Unfortunately, this also puts the kibosh on the Raiders season. I had to downgrade them to the very last tier. Oakland&rsquo;s offense will be incredibly pedestrian this year.</p>
