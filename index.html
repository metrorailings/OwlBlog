			<h2 id="tier-4"><strong><em>Tier 4</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Jacoby Brissett</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>T.Y. Hilton (WR), Marlon Mack (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Eric Ebron (TE), Devin Funchess (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Notable Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Jabaal Sheard (DT), Justin Houston (DE), Darius Leonard (OLB), Pierre Desir (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Chris Ballard (GM), Frank Reich (HC), Nick Sirianni (OC), Matt Eberflus (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On the offensive side, we have a bit of turnover. The tight ends coach and the two offensive line coaches from last year were flipped for new folks. A little concerning considering both position groups were critical in the team’s recent resurgence.</p>

<p>On the defensive side of the ball, everybody was retained. But we do have a new addition in all-pro Robert Mathis, who will be assisting the defensive coaches in training up the pass rushers. Now this is a promising development. The one knock against this team last year has been its mediocre pass rush. Having a legend like Robert Mathis coach the front seven in that area should serve the team well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once again, my thoughts on this team’s prospects last year were just dismally off. I expected this team to be fighting amongst the bottom-feeders as it rebuilds from the Check Pagano era. Instead, the team advanced to the division rounds of the playoffs, losing to Kansas City as Andrew Luck struggled handling the frigid air at Arrowhead Stadium. Frank Reich deserves some major credit for turning this team’s fortunes around - in my opinion, the man should have been given the nod as coach of the year.</p>

<p>Anyway, given that most of the coaching staff has been carried over from last year and that the free agents swooped up this year should be able to contribute positively, this team should be considered Super Bowl contenders.</p>

<p>However, it’ll be hard for them to grab a high seed for the playoffs. The Colts have one of the harder schedules this year. But more importantly, the AFC South is not an easy division to play in - none of the teams in this division can be considered pushovers. Frankly, arguments can be made for all four teams emerging as division champions this season. And without a high seed, Indianapolis may be forced to play in cold environments during the playoffs. As I said before, Luck struggles playing in frigid air, having grown up and played college ball in the temperate climate of California. Then again, if the Colts finally develop a well-rounded defense, that may carry them through to the championship next February…</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>Andrew Luck has voluntarily retired. Tragic too - the young man may have been remembered as one of the greats had he seen his career through to a natural end. But injuries have robbed him of any joy he had for playing football. It was ultimately a decision he made for his own health, above everything else.</p>

<p>In his stead, Jacoby Brissett now steps in as the team’s primary signal caller. And that means the team can no longer be considered Super Bowl contenders. Even the playoffs may be out of reach for the team this year. Fact is it’ll take time for Frank Reich and his coaching crew to mold Brissett into a serviceable quarterback. That being said, that offense still has a fair amount of talent, especially along the offensive line. So Brissett has some help there. And while the Colts defense find themselves undermanned, the unit is not short on fight. So even though the face of the franchise is gone, don’t expect the Colts to be keeling over any time this season.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-6"><strong><em>Tier 6</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Marcus Mariota, Ryan Tannehill (Backup)</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Derrick Henry (RB), Delanie Walker (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Adam Humphries (WR), Marcus Mariota (Mobile QB), Dion Lewis (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Jurrell Casey (DE), Cameron Wake (OLB), Kevin Byard (SS), Adoree Jackson (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Jon Robinson (GM), Mike Vrabels (HC), Arthur Smith (New OC), Dean Pees (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 8</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Despite Matt LeFleur’s departure for greener pastures in Wisconsin, the team managed to retain the rest of its offensive staff. Tight ends coach Arthur Smith was promoted to the coordinator position this year.</p>

<p>On defense, we have no new faces. Every major staff member from last year has been retained.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tennessee has quite a few good things going for them - a charismatic head coach in Mike Vrabel, a coaching staff that’s almost wholly carried over from last year, and quite a bit of talent at select spots along their roster.</p>

<p>Still, Tennessee’s biggest problem has always been the durability of their franchise quarterback. Mariota can’t really lead this team to the next level from the sidelines. Sure, Tannehill can spell him here and there if need be&hellip;but Tannehill is no Nick Foles. The Titans need Mariota healthy in order to be considered a top contender. And there’s little evidence that he can stave off injury for an entire season, especially if he insists on running with the ball every now and then.</p>

<p>So I think Vegas is spot on with their assessment of the Titans as an unremarkable 8-win team. It’s hard to make a firm prediction here, as variance will likely dictate on what side of 500 they’ll land on this season.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>Michael Lombardi is reporting that the Titans seem to be losing confidence in Marcus Mariota. While Mariota has played well at moments, his career has been marred by injuries and <em>inconsistency</em>. The man has yet to put together a whole season of quality work. If the coaches genuinely believe Mariota isn’t the answer at offense, it wouldn’t surprise me if that lack of conviction infects the team with a sort of malaise that drags them down into the dregs as the season progresses. After all, these Titans are a team that generally perform well, but excel at nothing - Mariota is more or less the de facto face of this Titan team. I do believe the Titans will be the worst team in the division this year.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-2"><strong><em>Tier 2</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Ben Roethlisberger</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Juju Smith-Schuster (WR), James Conner (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>James Washington (WR), Vance McDonald (TE), Donte Moncrief (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Cameron Heyward (DT), Stephon Tuitt (DE), T.J. Watt (OLB), Devin Bush (ILB), Steven Nelson (CB), Joe Haden (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Kevin Colbert (GM), Mike Tomlin (HC), Randy Fichtner (OC), Keith Butler (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, only the running backs coach has been formally flipped during the offseason. However, with Darryl Drake’s sudden death, the Steelers are now without their wide receivers coach from last year. Interestingly enough, it seems the team is content leaving Drake’s role vacant this year, maybe as a sort of tribute to him. One more thing worth noting&hellip;.Mike Munchak, the offensive line coach last year, left during the offseason to join Vic Fangio’s staff over in Denver - instead of shopping around for a new coach, the Steelers simply promoted his assistant to oversee the offensive line this year.</p>

<p>On defense, outside linebackers coach Joey Porter was fired during the offseason. Defensive coordinator Keith Butler will now be directly overseeing the outside linebackers on top of his regular coordinator duties. Other than that, the staff has remained intact from last year, save for the addition of Teryl Austin in an advisory role.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Steelers have finally rid themselves of locker room cancers in Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell. Some analysts predict a year of redemption for Ben Roethlisberger following a season dominated by petty drama and sloppy infighting. I say hold the brakes here. Even though Ben still has some life left in him, time is starting to wear him down. Last year, his quarterback play left much to be desired - mistakes were more common in his game than I could remember in years before. Perhaps nothing better exemplifies this than the game against the Broncos last year. Waning moments of the fourth quarter, third down, the Steelers are a yard or two away from tying the game up. In what looked like a run-pass option, Big Ben opted to pass. Except his pass ended up laughably short, right into the arms of a <em>defensive tackle,</em> of all people<em>.</em> It’s moments like these that make me wonder whether Roethlisberger can still demonstrate competence consistently enough to take this team far into the playoffs.</p>

<p>Now one could argue Ben’s job is made all the more difficult now that Antonio Brown is no longer with the team. While a valid point, I trust the Steelers brain trust to field a receiving corps that will far surpass expectations. After all, Mike Tomlin and his staff has had an entire offseason to scheme up a passing game that’s no longer headlined by Antonio Brown. So even if Pittsburgh doesn’t have a player of the same caliber as Brown, I do expect a few receivers to step up in his absence.</p>

<p>On defense, the team is looking more hopeful. T.J. Watt’s breakout last year was good news for a team that hasn’t had a dominant pass rusher the last few years (unless you count the aging James Harrison). The drafting of Devin Bush this year was yet another good move for a team that desperately missed the presence of an athletic linebacker. And the signing of free agent Steven Nelson should help shore up a secondary missing a legitimate cornerback opposite Joe Haden. If there is an area of concern, it’s depth - a key injury or two could cripple them defensively. Unless several other players step up, the Steelers need to hope the god of good health smiles upon them this year.</p>

<p>Overall, I expect a postseason berth. A Super Bowl is a possibility, albeit a remote one.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-4"><strong><em>Tier 4</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Baker Mayfield</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Odell Beckham (WR), Jarvis Landry (WR), Nick Chubb (RB), David Njoku (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Duke Johnson (RB), Antonio Callaway (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Myles Garrett (DE), Olivier Vernon (DE), Denzel Ward (CB), Joe Schobert (MLB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>John Dorsey (GM), Freddie Kitchens (New HC), Todd Monken (New OC), Steve Wilks (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>A new head coach brings quite a few new faces to the coaching staff. Todd Monken will now serve as the offensive coordinator. Interestingly enough, the running backs coach from last year, Ryan Lindley, has been retained as the quarterbacks coach for this year. I suppose it makes sense given that Lindley is a former quarterback. Anyway..the wide receivers coach has been retained for the same role as well. Otherwise, all the other people on the offensive coaching staff came with the new regime.</p>

<p>On defense, we see a bigger transformation. Save for the secondaries coach, the defensive coaching staff there has been completely revamped, with former head coach Steve Wilks now in charge as defensive coordinator.</p>

<hr />

<p>How quickly things (or rather, perceptions) change. The Browns went from being considered league fodder under Hue Jackson to now being hyped as Super Bowl contenders. And it’s hard not to be excited for the Browns. A talented quarterback entering his sophomore year <em>should</em> take some strides forward, especially with a receiving corps headlined by the likes of Odell Beckham and Jarvis Landry. The defense should improve as well now that Olivier Vernon will be joining Myles Garrett in the trenches - so long as the offense keeps the team playing from ahead, those two should have plenty of opportunity to hunt down opposing quarterbacks.</p>

<p>Even though he’s a rookie coach, Freddie Kitchens is seen as something of a tested commodity, having some success working with Baker Mayfield last year after Todd Haley was fired. After all, there’s a reason the Browns opted to promote Kitchens to head coach over the veteran Gregg Williams.</p>

<p>That being said, we must throw some cold water on the team’s championship prospects here. An entirely new coaching staff brings change&hellip;and change is something that takes time for players to absorb and handle. Furthermore, it remains to be seen as to whether Kitchens is ready for the stresses of being the lead coach. And honestly, there is reason to cast doubt. The team has been sensationalized in the media ever since Dorsey managed to poach Odell Beckham from the Giants. Instead of tamping down expectations and reminding the team that nothing great has been achieved as of yet, the coaches and management seem (more or less) content letting the spotlight rot this team’s collective psyche. Odell Beckham being a prima donna will not make things any easier for Kitchens - if the team goes into a slump, Odell will start chirping. In fact, his diva behavior has already been an issue this season when he opted to skip OTAs against his new head coach’s wishes.</p>

<p>The sportsbooks have upped the Browns’ win total to 9.5 this season, off the hype that followed the trade for Odell. It’s a very rosy outlook for a team buying too quickly into narratives about their greatness. I see the Browns ending this season with a last-minute push for the postseason that ends up falling just short.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-5"><strong><em>Tier 5</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Lamar Jackson</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Mark Ingram (RB), Lamar Jackson (Mobile QB), Mark Andrews (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Alex Collins (RB), Marquise Brown (WR), Hayden Hurst (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Brandon Williams (DT), Matt Judon (DE), Earl Thomas (FS), Tony Jefferson (SS), Marlon Humphrey (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Eric DeCosta (New GM), John Harbaugh (HC), Greg Roman (New OC), Don Martindale (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 8.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, we see quite a bit of reorganization this year now that Mornhinweg has been replaced with one of the main assistant coaches from last year, Greg Roman. Only one face is missing from last year - Thomas Hammock. Hammock left to become the head coach for a Division I college. In his former role is Matt Weiss, the wide receivers coach from last year. Speaking of which, the team’s only offensive coaching hire this year is David Culley, who’ll be overlooking the receiving corps now that Weiss will be managing the running backs. Kind of confusing how the Ravens shifted offensive coaches around different roles, though perhaps Greg Roman is simply trying to reorg his coaches where he best sees fit.</p>

<p>On defense, a new assistant coach has been added to train up the defensive backs. Other than that, everything remains the same from last year.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Ravens should do all right this season. The biggest question is whether Lamar Jackson can actually take that next step as a professional quarterback and commit more to passing the ball. Jackson is probably one of the two or three most athletic people in his position, but his skills as a traditional passer are just nowhere up to snuff. His balls are usually wide off the mark and his decision-making isn’t on point yet.</p>

<p>Luckily for the Ravens, Greg Roman is the type of man that can work with somebody like Lamar. Several years ago, Roman actually made Colin Kaepernick look competent for a whole season. Granted, Kaepernick was fortunate to be on such a strong team in the first place, but the fact that the 49ers went to the Super Bowl one year with Kaepernick at the helm of their offense stands as testament to Roman’s abilities to work with passers that prefer their legs over their arms. Also worth noting, the year after that, San Francisco fell just short of making the Super Bowl yet again with Kaepernick as their signal caller. So even though the Ravens have their work cut out for them, Roman should help make the situation a little easier.</p>

<p>The situation would have been so much easier had the Ravens actually surrounded their young signal caller with adequate talent. The reality here is that Baltimore lacks any dependable receivers that can help the quarterback, as (with one exception) the only skill players worthy of mention are either tight ends or halfbacks. Lamar needs those archetypical X receivers that can make circus catches every now and then. The Ravens have given him anything but that. Marquise Brown seems to be a positive step in the right direction, but it’s worth noting that man is more of a speedster than a jump receiver.</p>

<p>One more thing to talk about - defense. Baltimore had one of the best defenses last year. Not sure if that can be expected for this season though. Four key players were lost during free agency - C.J. Mosley, Za’Darius Smith, Eric Weddle, and defensive stalwart Terrell Suggs. While the Ravens did sign Earl Thomas to shore up the safety position, nothing else was really done to try and fill the vacancies left at other position groups by those free agents. It’s clear the team will be counting on depth players and draft selections to rise up and make this defense truly complete.</p>

<p>So their prognosis here is a middling season. Whether they end with a winning record and a possible postseason berth depends on variance. Given luck was probably on their side last year, I’m inclined to think this year will be a losing year for Baltimore.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-8"><strong><em>Tier 8</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Andy Dalton</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Tyler Boyd (WR), Joe Mixon (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>AJ Green (WR), Tyler Eifert (TE), C.J Uzomah (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Geno Atkins (DT), Carlos Dunlap (DE), Sam Hubbard (DE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Mike Brown (GM/Owner), Zac Taylor (New HC), Brian Callahan (New OC), Lou Anaramo (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>I’m starting to notice a trend here. Even if a team goes through a coaching overhaul, the new head coach opts to keep certain position coaches. In terms of offense, every single face on that staff is new save for the quarterbacks coach and the wide receivers coach. It is worth noting that an assistant coach has been added to train up quarterbacks. Perhaps management felt two coaches were necessary given that the team now has two rookie passers behind Andy Dalton.</p>

<p>Likewise on the defense, every face is new save for the two coaches responsible for overseeing the secondary.</p>

<hr />

<p>Not sure what to say about this team. I think McVay fever hit ownership hard here - Mike Brown decided that the Rams quarterback coach was the person best suited to be the next head coach of his team. Granted, Taylor is probably closer to McVay than anybody else on the Rams’ coaching staff, but it still felt like a hiring made out of a fear of missing out on a hot new fad. It wasn’t a hiring necessarily made in the best interest of the team.</p>

<p>Can Zac Taylor rejuvenate the Bengals the way Sean McVay rejuvenated the Rams? Not sure. It takes so much more than observing a great coach in action to be as successful as that coach. Ask all the Belichick assistants that have failed as head coaches themselves. One cannot simply emulate a coach’s winning style - it takes a certain level of emotional and raw intelligence to lead a winning organization. So if anything, the odds are stacked against Taylor here.</p>

<p>On top of that, AJ Green being injured leaves them with question marks at the wide receiver position. Outside of Green, the only other receiver that has proven his worth is Tyler Boyd. Boyd alone cannot carry the passing attack. For this team to be successful throwing the football, AJ Green and Tyler Eifert need to come back to the field sooner rather than later and stay healthy. Although perhaps if somebody else steps up, that would afford Cincinnati some leeway with the injury bug.</p>

<p>On defense, the team features solid talent along the frontlines, but nowhere else. The secondary is void of any truly noteworthy players. The only name worth mentioning is Dre Kirkpatrick for his veteran experience and his long history with the team. It’s possible that new defensive coordinator Lou Anaramo could work some magic here in the backfield though, given his experience training up journeymen defensive backs. I actually think he did good work last year with the Giants, though unlike Cincinnati, New York did have a few star defensive backs playing for them.</p>

<p>Honestly, it’s very hard to get a beat on this team given that the main coaches have almost no history as coordinators. The only thing that’s evident is that Zac Taylor will be bringing Sean McVay’s modified Shanahan system to the Bengals. Whether Cincinnati can adopt such a system rests on Taylor’s coaching. For all the reasons listed above, I doubt the Bengals will improve much from last year, if at all.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-1"><strong><em>Tier 1</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Tom Brady</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Julian Edelman (WR), James White (RB), Sony Michel (RB), Antonio Brown (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Josh Gordon (WR), Demaryius Thomas (WR), Cameron Meredith (WR), N’Keal Harry (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Michael Bennett (DE), Devin McCourty (FS), Patrick Chung (SS), Dont’a Hightower (LB), Kyle Van Noy (OLB), Stephon Gilmore (CB), Jamie Collins (OLB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Bill Belichick (HC/GM), Josh McDaniels (OC), Greg Schiano Jerod Mayo (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, the biggest change comes with wide receivers coach Chad O’Shea leaving the team to go become the offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins. Joe Judge, the special teams coordinator, will now be coaching the wide receivers in his stead. Add in a few new assistants and that about sums up the changes on the offensive coaching staff.</p>

<p>On defense, we have a rocky situation. With Brian Flores departing the team to go be the new head coach for the Dolphins, Greg Schiano was hired in the offseason to take over coordinator duties. However, Schiano abruptly vacated his post due to some family issues, leaving the Patriots without a coordinator at defense. Belichick apparently entrusted play-calling duties to longtime former Patriot Jerod Mayo, who actually played with some of the folks on the current roster not too long ago. Whether this move pans out remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The changes on the defensive coaching staff don’t end there, however. We have new coaches this year overlooking the linebackers and the defensive line, Mayo being one of them. The organization also promoted an assistant from last year to coach the cornerbacks now that the former cornerbacks coach left to go join Flores in Miami. It’s worth noting that none of these coaches were fired - all the coaches from last year that left did so voluntarily.</p>

<hr />

<p>The reigning champions can still defend their crown this year. Despite losing a whole boatload of assistant coaches and losing some key elements of their roster from last year, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady will find ways to win games.</p>

<p>A couple things worth watching here&hellip;first, we must see whether Josh Gordon can actually stay active for an entire season. If Gordon can ward off his inner demons and stay active on this roster for the regular season, New England will finally have a receiver that can dominate outside the numbers. Maybe the Patriots wouldn’t even miss Gronk so much, as Gronk was the one player on their team capable of winning against defenders with physicality alone.</p>

<p>Second, we need to see whether the defensive line can pressure the quarterback somewhat consistently now that Trey Flowers is no longer with the team. The Patriots smartly negotiated a trade for Michael Bennett during the offseason though. While the aging Bennett will probably not give the team as much as Flowers would have had he stayed, the man can still play at an elite level more often than not. Furthermore, the organization also brought Jamie Collins back into the fold. Before the Patriots dealt him to Cleveland a few years back, Collins was the best on that team at pressuring quarterbacks. While the wear and tear of football has likely worn down some of his potential, it’s possible that Belichick and the defensive coaches can train him back to notable form.</p>

<p>Third (and most important), we need to see whether Tom Brady starts to slow down. During the Super Bowl earlier in the year, Brady looked every bit like a 40 year-old quarterback. I can’t help but wonder then&hellip;was that a harbinger of things to come or was that simply a blip? Signs seem to indicate that Brady’s still able to ball as a starting quarterback, but I can’t shake this feeling that the man is in the midst of a steep decline. It’s possible that Brady is at that phase of his career where pass protection is absolutely crucial for him to function well. At this point, hits and sacks rattle him more than ever. If opposing defenses can harangue him, Brady could start breaking down mentally. If that happens, that will be the end of this Patriots dynasty.</p>

<p>Even though a few things do concern me, I still have this team ranked as a top-tier team, mostly out of respect to Belichick. It also helps that the Patriots play in a division where all the other teams are still pretty awful. I expect New England to slide into the playoffs with a high seed. Whether they advance to yet another Super Bowl depends mostly on Brady and the number of skill players that show up on offense as reliable vectors.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>The Patriots were able to scoop up Antonio Brown after he was released from the Raiders. So long as Belichick keeps the rowdy head case in line, the Patriots finally have an outside receiver that can dominate outside the numbers. Pair him up with Josh Gordon and New England may have the best set of receivers in the game today. It&rsquo;s so unfair.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Kenyan Drake (RB), DeVante Parker (WR), Dwayne Allen (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Christian Wilkins (DT), Xavien Howard (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, only the running backs coach was spared from the inevitable overhaul that came when Brian Flores assumed head coaching duties following the firing of Adam Gase.</p>

<p>Similarly on defense, only the defensive backs coach from last year survived the regime change, though the man will only be responsible for the safeties this season.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nothing to expect here but another losing season. The Dolphins are truly bereft of talent across all aspects of their roster.</p>

<p>However, it seems the coaches are consciously going out of their way to deconstruct this roster. The team is initiating a rebuild following years of mediocrity under Adam Gase - new coach Brian Flores has let the team’s biggest free-agents walk this offseason without replacing any of them, save for a few players brought over from his alma mater in New England. The Dolphins’ brain trust has committed themselves wholesale to the idea of a multi-year rebuild, even going as far as trading away franchise quarterback Ryan Tannehill and star left tackle Laremy Tunsil for additional draft capital.</p>

<p>Still, it’s not as if the Dolphins are looking to bomb the season away. Miami traded a second round pick to Arizona in exchange for first-round passing prospect Josh Rosen. While Rosen didn’t really impress much last year, keep in mind the kid wasn’t given much help from his coaches - first year head coach Steve Wilks and offensive coordinator Mike McCoy were so awful at their jobs that the Cardinals executives were forced to blow apart the coaching staff for a second straight year. On top of that, the Cardinals fielded one of the worst offensive lines last season. And rookie quarterbacks without protection are practically guaranteed to fail. So with all that said, it’s not too outlandish to say Rosen has the potential to be the team’s new franchise quarterback. Luckily, the Dolphins spent comparatively little in acquiring Rosen, so Miami can move on from the second-year passer should he fail to pan out this season.</p>

<p>Concisely put, Miami will be going through the motions this year. Nothing much is expected of them this season, but that’s all right.</p>
