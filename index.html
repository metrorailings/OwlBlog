	<div class='postTitle'>Eagles Playoff Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>With a little help from the Bears, the Eagles have slipped back into the playoffs as the bottom seed in the National Football Conference. Will Nick&rsquo;s BD work its magic again this year?</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-nick-foles-nate-sudfeld">Quarterback: <em>Nick Foles / Nate Sudfeld</em></h4>

<p>Nick Foles seems like an elite quarterback. Watching film from yesterday&rsquo;s game against the Redskins, I saw him looking off zone defenders, taking whatever opportunities were available to him, and throwing the ball with a little touch in order to hit his receivers in stride.</p>

<p>But the man didn&rsquo;t throw a single deep ball in yesterday&rsquo;s game. His longest play was an 18-yard sideline pass to Alshon Jeffery. And I wonder if it&rsquo;s related to injuries related to a rib shot he sustained last week against Houston. If his ribs are truly an issue, than Nick will have a tough time surviving this postseason -  the hits will continue to mount for Foles as opposing pass rushers will likely dominate a weakened Eagles offensive line. And if his play is hindered in any way, the Eagles lose whatever hope they have left to go far into the playoffs.</p>

<p>Worse yet, if Foles were to ever be knocked out of a game, then Nate Sudfeld will be forced to take the reigns of the offense. The Eagles might be better off waving a white flag at that point.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-alshon-jeffery-zach-ertz">Offensive Weapons: <em>Alshon Jeffery, Zach Ertz</em></h4>

<p>Jeffery and Ertz are the two most important skill players on the team. Jeffery in particular seems to be more valuable than Ertz at this point. Despite Ertz&rsquo;s historic season and sure hands, something tells me Foles has more of a liking for Jeffery and his ability to outmuscle defensive backs for the football.</p>

<p>On a bit of a side note, If there&rsquo;s one area in which this year&rsquo;s Eagles differ the most from last year&rsquo;s Eagles, it&rsquo;s offensive weaponry. The championship team from last year could also count on Nelson Agholor in the slot and a strong rushing attack led by Jay Ajayi, in addition to Zach Ertz and Alshon Jeffery. All those weapons were critical in helping Foles play at an unbelievably elite level heading into the Super Bowl. This year though&hellip;Agholor has regressed back to mediocrity and not a single running back has come even close to matching the rushing numbers from last year. It&rsquo;s not only injuries that have wrecked the ground game - the entire offensive line seemed to have taken a gigantic step backward in terms of run-blocking. Watching several of their games this season, I noticed there were too many times halfbacks were met in the backfield by opposing defenders. I remember noting early in the season that generic blitzes were killing this offensive line. I&rsquo;m sure things have improved, but it&rsquo;s worrisome that an offensive line coming off a banner year would find themselves struggling with basic blitz concepts.</p>

<p>But there is hope for Philly - Josh Adams seems to be impressing in the ground game, albeit in spurts. And against Washington, the interior of the offensive line was actually able to generate push on a consistent basis. Still though, I&rsquo;m going to play things cautiously here and assume that this team is not ready to hang its hat on Adams yet - for any halfback to be considered a significant offensive weapon, I need to see sustained success against decent teams. So if Philly can run the ball with some success against Chicago and New Orleans&hellip;then I&rsquo;ll be adding Josh Adams&rsquo; name to this list.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-michael-bennett-fletcher-cox">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Michael Bennett, Fletcher Cox</em></h4>

<p>Both Michael Bennett and Fletcher Cox have been lighting up opposing quarterbacks all season. Bennett has been an especially impressive addition to the roster this year, taking the mantle of chief edge rusher away from the disappointing Brandon Graham. Fletcher Cox, meanwhile, is still up to his old ways, racking up roughly 35 quarterback hits over the course of the season.</p>

<p>An argument could be made that Chris Long should be added to the list. His 20 quarterback hits is above that of other edge rushers I consider elite, such as Melvin Ingram. Still, his mundane tackling and  numbers paint a different picture.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>Normally, playoff inexperience should be no concern to the reigning Super Bowl champions, but most of the starting defensive backs will be playing in the postseason for the first time. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the corners are a bit rattled initially against Chicago, especially given that it&rsquo;s a road game.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-doug-pederson-hc-mike-groh-oc-jim-schwartz-dc">Coach: <em>Doug Pederson (HC), Mike Groh (OC), Jim Schwartz (DC)</em></h4>

<p>Doug Pederson has proved himself after going on a Super Bowl run with a team that was racked with injuries. Likewise, Jim Schwartz is a proven commodity at defensive coordinator. So there should be no doubt that the coaching staff here is talented.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>Believe it or not, the Eagles could actually reach the Super Bowl. Yeah, I said it&hellip;the Eagles could end up as NFC champions yet again. <strong>BUT&hellip;</strong><em>only if  Nick Foles remains healthy.</em> If Foles is seriously injured at any point during the postseason, the Eagles will be cleaning out their lockers pretty damn soon afterwards. Guaranteed.</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>My favorite holiday of the year. Not because of the turkey or the food or anything, fuck that. It&rsquo;s all about having the day off to make bets on three consecutive primetime football games.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look through each game and find some bets to like. I feel good about these slate of games too.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="chicago-bears-detroit-lions-2-5-point-total-43-5">Chicago Bears @ Detroit Lions (+2.5) (Point Total: 43.5)</h4>

<p>The spread cleared below the key number of 3 earlier today as word finally got around that Mitch Trubisky was highly unlikely to play.</p>

<p>But would that really change much? Mitch Trubisky hasn&rsquo;t exactly been lighting the world on fire, despite what his raw numbers may initially indicate. His passing performance has been panned by analytical outlets and respectable commentators alike. What has been his saving grace has been his ability to run circles around defenders. And Chase Daniel doesn&rsquo;t have that talent, unfortunately. Nor is he much of a passer, obviously.</p>

<p>The Bears can still put up points courtesy of some fantastic scripted plays from Matt Nagy, but even he can only draw up so many plays before that well of creativity dries up.</p>

<p>Seems like a good time to bet on the Lions, no? Except the Lions will now be missing the services of <strong>both</strong> Marvin Jones and Kerryon Johnson. Kenny Galliday and Theo Riddick will now be the bellcows of Detroit&rsquo;s passing attack. And I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s enough to keep this game competitive against the NFL&rsquo;s best defense.</p>

<p>That under is looking sexy though&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Bet: Under 43.5</strong></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="washington-redskins-dallas-cowboys-7-point-total-40-5">Washington Redskins @ Dallas Cowboys (-7) (Point Total: 40.5)</h4>

<p>The books seem to think the Redskins will take a step back after Alex Smith&rsquo;s tragic season-ending injury last week. But Alex Smith was never a solid fit in the offensive system Jay Gruden was trying to institute. Colt McCoy, on the other hand, has demonstrated some comfort in Gruden&rsquo;s system. So it&rsquo;s very possible (even likely) that Washington will actually perform better with Colt McCoy at the helm of the offense. In fact, the offense actually came alive a bit when Colt stepped in - his first pass was a touchdown throw to Jordan Reed.</p>

<p>On top of that, these Cowboys are a little overrated. That win over the Falcons last week was driven mostly by Ezekiel Elliott. And unlike Atlanta&rsquo;s bottom-ranked defense, the Redskins defense have the chops to limit the havoc he wreaks. Not to mention the Redskins boast a bunch of quality pass rushers that can force the easily-flustered Dak Prescott into throwing some bad passes.</p>

<p><strong>Bets: Redskins +7, Redskins ML, &amp; Michael Gallup to Score a TD</strong></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="atlanta-falcons-new-orleans-saints-13-point-total-59-5">Atlanta Falcons @ New Orleans Saints (-13) (Point Total: 59.5)</h4>

<p>I went into some length in a <a href="https://www.owlpicks.com/posts/reviewing-atlanta-s-loss-against-the-cowboys/" title="post">post</a> yesterday about why the Falcons stand a good chance of covering against the Saints. Towards the end of that post, I also alluded to the fact that both teams should be able to feast against one another. Atlanta is struggling badly against the run, which bodes well for a Saints team that loves to pound the ball on the ground. But at the same time, the Saints defense isn&rsquo;t really anything special. While their run defense has been quite good so far, their pass rush and secondary needs some work. I already spoke at length about their pass rush in <a href="https://www.owlpicks.com/posts/reviewing-atlanta-s-loss-against-the-cowboys/">yesterday&rsquo;s post</a>, so let me just quickly discuss the secondary here. Marcus Lattimore was absolutely phenomenal last year as a rookie defensive back. But this year, he&rsquo;s clearly lost some of his magic. Eli Apple is shaping up into a decent cornerback, but he&rsquo;s only one man in a secondary now ridden with holes everywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>Bets: Falcons +13 &amp; Over 59.5</strong></p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Reviewing Atlanta&#39;s Loss Against the Cowboys</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>To nudge myself out of the funk I was in Sunday night, when I barely missed hitting a lucrative five-team parlay (may the gods smite Kirk Cousins for the rest of his life), I decided to review game tape from the Falcons loss to the Cowboys earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Two major takeaways&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Matt Ryan found himself flustered by Dallas&rsquo; pass rush, especially when they blitzed. His worst throws of the day came against blitzes.</li>
<li>The Falcons have serious issues bottling up opposing rushers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those two reasons are why the Falcons fell to Dallas. While Atlanta stands little chance of making it to the postseason, it&rsquo;s still worth taking note of their advantages and shortcomings so that we can continue betting on their remaining games this season. Speaking of which&hellip;this Thanksgiving, the dirty birds will be traveling to New Orleans to face off against the Saints&hellip;<em>as 13-point underdogs</em>. Think of that - the Falcons as double-digit underdogs, despite Matt Ryan playing comparatively well.</p>

<p>So the question becomes whether the Saints are likely to cover. And honestly, I&rsquo;d say no.</p>

<p>First off, it&rsquo;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.owlpicks.com/games/12/">my Elo spread</a> and the Vegas spread have <strong>finally</strong> drifted apart. It took quite a few blowouts, but the books have finally begun inflating the Saints&rsquo; handicap in anticipation of the public inevitably coming in heavy on them.  So we know the line for this game is a little skewed.</p>

<p>But really, where the Falcons gain an edge here is in pass protection. The absolute best way to stall Matt Ryan is to field a strong pass rush augmented with well-timed blitzes. The Cowboys have the horses to pull that off - New Orleans, not so much. Despite some positive numbers from Sheldon Rankins and their first-round rookie, Marcus Davenport, the reality is that the Saints should be producing much more pressure given that their opponents are playing from behind so much of the damn time. The Eagles from last year are a textbook example of ramping up the pressure when playing with a lead.</p>

<p>Now New Orleans boasts a powerful ground game that will expose the Falcons and their soft run defense. Still, Atlanta should be able to eat as well in this game, making this spread just a tad bit too ridiculous for my liking.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 11 - Risky Propositions</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>In this series, I&rsquo;ll details bets that are a little risky for my blood.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="panthers-lions">Panthers @ Lions</h5>

<p>Such a beautiful spot for the Lions here. Coming off three embarrassing losses, Detroit is primed to play better now that they&rsquo;ve returned back home and their season is on the line. And last week&rsquo;s game against Chicago shows me that the team can defend against the run when it&rsquo;s a central focus of their defensive game plan. Snacks Harrison manning the nose position has brought their rush defense up a notch.</p>

<p>If the Panthers cannot run the ball with reckless abandon here, Carolina may actually struggle to move the chains, let alone put up points. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a terrible bet to put some money on the Lions here, but <em>Marvin Jones</em> will be ruled out of the game on injury. The offense was gimpy without Golden Tate, but now you take their best receiver off the field as well? Too risky.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="cowboys-falcons">Cowboys @ Falcons</h5>

<p>The Falcons were depressing last week. Matt Ryan loses a step as a passer whenever he plays outside a dome. On top of that, that defense was carved up by Baker Mayfield and his skill players.</p>

<p>Now, the Falcons are currently fielding the league&rsquo;s worst run defense, on a yards-per-carry basis. But in fairness, that dishonor can be attributed to a 92-yard run Nick Chubb ripped off for a touchdown last week. Take away that play and the Falcons would instead be ranked as the tenth worst team against the run. Still, the point is that Atlanta is susceptible against the rush, which should be sweet music to a Cowboys team that rediscovered their ground game last week against the Eagles. If Ezekiel Elliott was able to chew off 150 yards on 20 carries at Philadelphia in primetime, the man should be ready to feast again on a Falcons defense that&rsquo;s equally inept at defending the run.</p>

<p>Then again, the Falcons do have one thing going for them - the fact that the team plays a few orders of magnitude better within the confines of their dome. In particular, take Matt Ryan - his passes see much more air in Atlanta than anywhere else. Likewise, I&rsquo;d think that defense plays with more energy in front of their home crowd. So it&rsquo;s a bit difficult to take a side here, especially when Dak Prescott insists on playing stupid from time to time.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 11 - Solid Bets</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>All right, so the Supercontest is a lost cause. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m treading water at exactly 50%. Statistically, I&rsquo;m no better than a coin. A fucking coin.</p>

<p>But at the very least, each season offers up lessons for me to internalize. I like to believe I improve as a bettor every year. To be honest though, my best year as a sports gambler has been the first year I&rsquo;ve actually started wagering serious money. Sooner or later, I will eventually match my sensational performance from that year.</p>

<p>Until then&hellip;week 11.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="vikings-2-5-bears"><em>Vikings (+2.5)</em> @ Bears</h5>

<p>The few outlets and NFL writers I respect have all sided with Minnesota here. And I will too.</p>

<p>Mitchell Trubisky is overrated. Analytical outfits continue to trash him week after week, despite his glowing passer rating. Careful observers have noted Trubisky&rsquo;s shortcomings, particularly against the blitz. And Mike Zimmer, as one of the best defensive minds in the game, has a history of exposing bad quarterbacks.</p>

<p>So at the very least, expect the Bears offense to finally stall this week, despite Matt Nagy&rsquo;s best attempts to scheme around a quarterback with limited ability.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="buccaneers-giants-2-5">Buccaneers @ <em>Giants (-2.5)</em></h5>

<p>The Buccaneers are losers. To rack up over 500-ish yards on offense only to post 3 measly points&hellip;it&rsquo;s pathetic. The Buccaneers are a damn mess on offense. Neither Jameis nor Fitzpatrick are serving the team well.</p>

<p>The Giants on the other hand have stepped up their game last week. Sure, Eli Manning was not as impressive as his statistics from last week may imply&hellip;but Eli still managed to finish drives, one of which won the game.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay should be able to score a few times in the game, but I expect the Giants to rack up even more points. Reviewing the game tape from last week, it seems Tampa Bay is happily content playing a soft zone defense. And these defenses tend to be exposed by offenses fielding a solid bunch of receivers. So the Giants have no excuse to lose this game in their quest to win out the rest of the season.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="eagles-saints-8-5">Eagles @ <em>Saints (-8.5)</em></h5>

<p>Seems odd to see the reigning Super Bowl champions be such heavy underdogs. But the Elo model thinks it&rsquo;s well-deserved.</p>

<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m shocked that the sportsbooks haven&rsquo;t set the line even higher, considering the Saints are coming off three consecutive covers against solid competition. I&rsquo;d honestly expect the books to set the line a little higher than usual in order to pull underdog money against such an elite team. Either the books are fine pricing the Saints appropriately or the spread is kept lower than usual to entice bets on a public darling in the Saints. If the latter is the case, that means the books are taking a chance on the Eagles here in this match. And that&rsquo;s a risky proposition in my book.</p>

<p>The Eagles are far from being that team that took the league by storm last year. Michael Lombardi gave me some phenomenal insights in his observations about the team. Last season, the team was converting third downs at an unbelievable clip.  This season, statistical regression finally reared its ugly head - Philadelphia is struggling to overcome third-down from six yards and out. Worse yet, the Eagles cannot run the ball, leading to their offense being one-dimensional. A pass-only offense is not necessarily a terrible thing so long as the quarterback has several weapons reliably catching his passes, but Philly&rsquo;s even lacking horses there. Nelson Agholor has regressed to mediocre form while Alshon Jeffery has been hampered by injury for much of the season.</p>

<p>To be fair, their acquisition of Golden Tate should even things out a bit, but I honestly wonder whether that would be enough to keep pace with the league&rsquo;s hottest team on their home soil.</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Good week last week from a betting perspective, even if two of my Supercontest picks were losers. A superteaser hit landed me a pretty penny. Anyway&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="saints-6-bengals"><em>Saints (-6)</em> @ Bengals</h5>

<p>Give me the Saints all day long.</p>

<p>The Bengals biggest problem on offense has always been that they lack reliable weapons that have won over the trust of their quarterback, Andy Dalton. And now you tell me his <em>most trusted receiver in AJ Green</em> is out? I couldn&rsquo;t care less about Joe Mixon - AJ Green is fundamentally integral to this offense. Without him, Cincinnatti&rsquo;s passing game loses much more than just a step.</p>

<p>The only thing that worries me is this potentially being a let-down spot for the Saints after two momentous wins against NFC heavyweights. But I&rsquo;ll chance it here with one of the NFL&rsquo;s more prolific offenses.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="falcons-5-browns"><em>Falcons (-5)</em> @ Browns</h5>

<p>I respect the Falcons and I respect their potent offense. But I disrespect the Browns so much more. The Browns had all the emotional fuel last week to cover against as 8-point underdogs against the Chiefs&hellip;and they still blow it.</p>

<p>The Browns will lose, with or without Hue Jackson. Losing is in their DNA this season. And even better, Gregg Williams seems intent on making sure the team stays true to their destiny this year.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="patriots-titans-6-5">Patriots @ <em>Titans (+6.5)</em></h5>

<p>Sure, the Titans come into this contest a little banged up off a short week, but I&rsquo;ll take my chances with Marcus Mariota and Mike Vrabel in Tennessee. This year&rsquo;s Patriots are not as intimidating as the Patriots of last year. More importantly, the team has played decisively worse on the road than at home.</p>

<p>The game will be decided on whether the Titans offensive line can hold Trey Flowers, Adrian Clayborn, and Deatrich Wise long enough for Marcus Mariota to throw some dimes.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="jaguars-colts-3">Jaguars @ <em>Colts (-3)</em></h5>

<p>Interesting line. I used to be a big fan of the Jaguars earlier in the season, especially after they stomped the Patriots and Jets early in the season. But after that Chiefs game, the team has turned into an unmitigated disaster. Blake Bortles has regressed to joke form, the defense is tussling with one another in the locker room, defensive backs are doing some incredibly stupid things off the field, the coaches are not even fully aware of the injury situations of their starters&hellip;</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Colts are on the up-and-up, having lit up the scoreboards the last two weeks (albeit against incredibly poor competition). Two positive games hint at a trend, but a third solid game tells me that the team is for real. Given that Indy has Andrew Luck at quarterback and Frank Reich as head coach, I do believe this Colts team is for real.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="cowboys-eagles-6-5">Cowboys @ <em>Eagles (-6.5)</em></h5>

<p>Not the biggest fan of this pick, but the Supercontest mandates I pick five games a week, and I like to pick teams led by a good head coach and a good quarterback. It also helps that the Eagles boast one of the best set of pass rushers in the league. And I&rsquo;d much rather side with Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham matching up against a beleaguered Cowboys offensive front and a struggling quarterback.</p>

<p>Then again, I&rsquo;m not liking these Eagles players constantly chirping about their distaste for the Cowboys. You&rsquo;re only giving Dallas more emotional fodder by being so public with your trash talk of the Ladyboys here.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Bucs @ Panthers - Some Quick Game Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Just some real quick analysis&hellip;.</p>

<p>The Panthers played phenomenal here, much to my surprise. And yet, a part of me still has questions of whether the Panthers are actually a legitimate playoff threat.</p>

<p>Their success in the last game was predicated on two things - devilishly creative play-calling and an eagerness to blitz against an offense that has <em>absolutely</em> no ability to read an incoming blitz.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me? Well, let me show you a few plays that stood out to me.</p>

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:55.05%'>
    <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/PastViciousKoi' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' 
            height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Look at that double-reverse. You don&rsquo;t see many teams running that type of play, but the Panthers have the exact right personnel to run that type of play - a threatening rusher in Christian McCaffrey and two swiss-knife playmakers in DJ Moore and Damiere Byrd. The Bucs defense was completely out of sorts by the time  DJ Moore began motioning uphill.</p>

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:55.05%'>
    <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WeeklyDearestAntipodesgreenparakeet' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' 
            height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Look at that blitz being telegraphed prior to the ball being snapped. And yet the Panthers pass rushers on that play still manage to throw Fitzpatrick into a tizzy.</p>

<p>The Buccaneers began coming back in the second half, in part because Tampa Bay managed to neutralize the blitz every now and then (maybe by luck?). Still, the team let their quarterback be abused far too many times in the second half - Fitzpatrick deserves a purple heart for trying to mount a comeback in those circumstances.</p>

			<h5 id="packers-5-patriots"><em>Packers (+5)</em> @ Patriots</h5>

<p>Listen, it&rsquo;s always risky betting against the Patriots, but their defense is a little too tepid for my liking. The Packers will cover so long as Bill Belichick&rsquo;s defense fail to keep Aaron Rodger&rsquo;s receivers bottled up under man coverage. As I keep saying, the Packers can be routed so long as you have a defensive secondary that can hold up well in man-to-man defense. If you don&rsquo;t have such a secondary, expect Rodgers to run up some scores on you.</p>

<p>That being said, the only truly solid corner the Patriots bring to field is Stephon Gilmore, which would normally be a cause for concern if New England was coached by anybody but Bill Belichick. But the Darth has a way of bringing out better performances from his defensive personnel on certain weeks. Now would be the week for his defensive backs to step up and make Aaron Rodgers hold the ball long enough so that Trey Flowers to hit home.</p>

<p>Now even if the Packers see some of their drives stall through the game, Green Bay can still cover the spread. The Packers boast a quality pass rush that can throw Brady off on some of his drives. So I like Green Bay quite a bit here.</p>

<p>Of course, whenever I end up liking a side a <em>little too much,</em> the betting gods find a way to fuck me. So beware here&hellip;</p>
