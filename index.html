			<h3 id="colts-texans-1">Colts @ Texans (-1)</h3>

<p>Loving the Texans here. The Texans are the team with more talent, more playoff experience, and home field advantage. Houston <em>should</em> win rather commandingly here.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Texans (ML)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="seahawks-cowboys-2-5">Seahawks @ Cowboys (-2.5)</h3>

<p>Both teams are roughly even on defense. However, the Cowboys are playing with home field advantage, whereas the Seahawks come into this contest with an elite quarterback and a more dynamic offense. Not quite certain what will play a bigger role in this game, but the Seahawks carry another advantage over the Cowboys here - coaching. Pete Carroll is the craftier coach in this match-up.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Seahawks (+2.5)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="chargers-ravens-3">Chargers @ Ravens (-3)</h3>

<p>The hardest game for me to predict this week. Both defenses are stocked with talent. Yes, the Chargers bring a far better quarterback to the table, but the Ravens offense have more weapons with which to attack <del>Los Angeles</del> San Diego&rsquo;s defense. But in the end, what should make all the difference in the world here is that this game is taking place in Maryland instead of Los Angeles.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Ravens (ML)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="eagles-bears-6-5">Eagles @ Bears (-6.5)</h3>

<p>My other favorite pick this week will be the Eagles. Yes, the Bears have had an outstanding season. But the lack of playoff experience and the liability playing at quarterback will drag them back, especially against a team as stacked as the Eagles.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Eagles (+6.5)</strong></p>

			<p>The dynasty team finds its way into the playoffs yet again, this time as the second seed in the American Football Conference.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-tom-brady">Quarterback: <em>Tom Brady</em></h4>

<p>One year removed from being crowned the league MVP, Tom Brady is still very much an elite player. That being said, his play has regressed a bit. His deep ball accuracy percentage sunk downward from 46.5% to 43%. His passing yards per attempt has dropped by about three-tenths of a yard. He&rsquo;s also scored fewer touchdowns this year, opting to throw slightly more interceptions instead.</p>

<p>But the question that needs to be asked here is whether this regression can be attributed to Brady aging or his fellow teammates failing him. And honestly, it&rsquo;s a difficult question to answer. Tom Brady is past retirement age, so he&rsquo;s long overdue for a downfall, but the Patriots skill players are no longer these weapons that can reliably produce. Chris Hogan is no longer the slasher he was the last couple of years. Nor is Rob Gronkowski anywhere close to being a dominant tight end anymore. Brandin Cooks being shipped off to Los Angeles didn&rsquo;t help things either, as the offense lacked a deep receiving threat to start the season. Midway through the year, it seems the Patriots finally found that trusted deep threat in Josh Gordon, but the man&rsquo;s personal demons were too much for the team to handle. So without Gordon, the Patriots are back in the same situation they were in at the beginning of the season.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-james-white-julian-edelman">Offensive Weapons: <em>James White, Julian Edelman</em></h4>

<p>As the only player to have garnered over 1000 yards from scrimmage this season, James White deserves top billing on this list. The Patriots love their wheel routes and no other halfback on this team runs those routes as smoothly as James White.</p>

<p>Likewise, Julian Edelman deserves to be on this list as well, simply for being Brady&rsquo;s favorite receiver. Brady truly thrives when he has a receiver that can run all sorts of directions from the slot position. Over the years, Edelman and Brady have developed a rapport that no other current receiver on the team can match. That relationship will be critical if the Patriots are to reach the conference championships.</p>

<p>Now&hellip;notice Gronk is not on this list?  Well, this year may have been Rob Gronkowski&rsquo;s worst year in football, statistically speaking. For a guy that was averaging over 76 yards a game for the past five years, his 52.5 yards per game this year is shockingly low. Furthermore, scoring only 3 touchdowns over 13 games is not a good stat for a man that was heralded as one of the league&rsquo;s best red zone weapons. It&rsquo;s become clear to many people that Gronkowski is no longer the beast he was in years past, running amok along the middle of the field while undersized defensive backs tried hopelessly to keep him contained. And as a result, he can no longer be counted on as a dependable offensive weapon.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-trey-flowers">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Trey Flowers</em></h4>

<p>For the second year in a row, Trey Flowers has been the team&rsquo;s star at rushing the quarterback. With 20 quarterback hits and 32 solo tackles, Flowers has made his presence known in quite a few games this season.</p>

<p>The only other edge rusher worth consideration here is Deatrich Wise Jr. But numbers alone are sufficient to come to a conclusion here. Last year, the man posted 19 quarterback hits, 5 sacks, and 16 solo tackles. This year, he only notched 16 quarterback hits, 4.5 sacks, and 15 solo tackles. If I did not consider him to be an elite pass rusher last year, why the hell would I consider him one this year when the numbers paint a weaker picture?</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>The Patriots roll into the postseason with several new faces, but the major players on the team are all well-versed in playoff football. The only major starters lacking playoff experience are running backs Sony Michel and Cordarrelle Patterson, corner Jason McCourty, and left tackle Trent Brown.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-bill-belichick-hc-josh-mcdaniels-oc">Coach: <em>Bill Belichick (HC), Josh McDaniels (OC)</em></h4>

<p>The wunderkind Sean McVay is definitely a great coach, if simply for making Jared Goff look like an MVP candidate for a couple weeks. With the right personnel, his offensive schemes produces excellent results. Likewise, Wade Phillips is a fantastic defensive coordinator in his own right. Even if his unit has not been anything worth raving about this year, the man holds distinction as a defensive mastermind. So I trust the Rams are in good hands with these two leading the team.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>In years past, the Patriots were almost always Super Bowl contenders. This year is a different story. With a pedestrian defense and a reduced offense, the Patriots may not even win one playoff game this year.</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Rams stumbled for a bit, but finally righted the ship at the end of the season to claim the second seed in the National Football Conference.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-jared-goff">Quarterback: <em>Jared Goff</em></h4>

<p>Some were making the case early in the season that Goff deserves serious MVP consideration. That case quickly went to shit after the Rams returned from their bye week. With defenses finally having decoded the Rams offensive scheme and Gurley banged up, Goff was largely left up to his own devices to create plays on the fly.</p>

<p>The results were not pretty. Sure, the Rams eked out a win and covered the spread against the scum-tier Lions, but they were blown away in their next two outings against the Bears and Eagles. The young man had the opportunity to build a name for himself and he faltered in the spotlight twice.</p>

<p>So no, Goff isn&rsquo;t elite.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-todd-gurley-robert-woods">Offensive Weapons: <em>Todd Gurley, Robert Woods</em></h4>

<p>Gurley is the single most important member on offense. For some reason, Sean McVay has no confidence in Malcolm Brown, the halfback behind Gurley on the depth chart. I hypothesize this is because he may have serious issues catching the ball out of the backfield. Throughout the whole season, he has only been targeted 7 times in the pass game. <em>Yes&hellip;7 targets over 12 games.</em> Horrendous. Even in those few weeks after the bye when Gurley&rsquo;s health was in question, Todd was still the only halfback on the team catching passes. Things might change a little now that C.J. Anderson has been brought into the roster, but his performance so far this year seems to indicate that his best days were behind him.</p>

<p>Robert Woods is the other weapon that I think the Rams can reliably depend upon. And really, I put Woods on this list solely because I think Goff trusts him the most out of all the other pass-catchers not named Todd Gurley or Cooper Kupp. After Kupp sustained a season-ending injury, not a single receiver has really distinguished himself from then onward. Woods has been the most productive wideout over that time period, recording 387 yards and 3 touchdowns. It also helps that he&rsquo;s the only wide receiver targeted on more than 20% of his routes over that time frame. So his inclusion on this list has less to do with his performance and more to do with his role on the team heading into the postseason.</p>

<p>Frankly, an argument can be made that no receiver belongs to be on this list now that McVay&rsquo;s offensive game-planning has been solved by the better defenses in the league. And it may be an argument I need to take more seriously as we get closer and closer to the Rams division round appearance.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-aaron-donald">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Aaron Donald</em></h4>

<p>The Rams are short-handed here as well. Aaron Donald is <strong>the</strong> best pass rusher in today&rsquo;s NFL&hellip;but the reality is that it takes more than one edge rusher to really set a defense apart in the postseason. Ndamukong Suh and Dante Fowler have failed to pan out as complimentary pieces lining up alongside Donald. Samson Ebukam had a brilliant game against the Chiefs, but nothing much outside of that.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Suh has especially disappointed. Despite some of his gaudy numbers this season, the man hasn&rsquo;t been a consistent threat pressuring the passer. Barring last season, it&rsquo;s fair to say this may be Suh&rsquo;s worst year yet.  There&rsquo;s a reason why the Rams were willing to deal out two draft picks to acquire Fowler from Jacksonville back in October.  Unfortunately, the former Jaguar hasn&rsquo;t done much to justify their investment in him.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>The Rams are in excellent shape here. All the key playmakers have postseason experience dating back to last year. Aqib Talib may need some time to settle into that playoff groove, but he shouldn&rsquo;t have much of an issue, given his history of playing in 8 postseason games.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-sean-mcvay-hc-wade-phillips-dc">Coach: <em>Sean McVay (HC), Wade Phillips (DC)</em></h4>

<p>The wunderkind Sean McVay is definitely a great coach, if simply for making Jared Goff look like an MVP candidate for a couple weeks. With the right personnel, his offensive schemes produces excellent results. Likewise, Wade Phillips is a fantastic defensive coordinator in his own right. Even if his unit has not been anything worth raving about this year, the man holds distinction as a defensive mastermind. So I trust the Rams are in good hands with these two leading the team.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>The Rams have a shot to play in the conference championships. Dallas would be a far better match-up for them in the division round compared to Seattle, but Los Angeles can beat Seattle too, so long as Gurley heals up over the bye week. However, the Super Bowl is still just a pipe dream for this team.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Chiefs Playoff Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Chiefs have emerged from nowhere and seized the top seed in the American Football Conference, thanks largely to the future MVP playing at quarterback - Patrick Mahomes.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-patrick-mahomes">Quarterback: <em>Patrick Mahomes</em></h4>

<p>As the prospective MVP of the season, there&rsquo;s no question Patrick Mahomes is an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-tyreek-hill-travis-kelce">Offensive Weapons: <em>Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce</em></h4>

<p>Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce were spectacular last year, but even better this year now that a truly elite quarterback was at the helm of the offense. Both easily broke past the millenium yard mark on route to scoring double-digit touchdowns this year.</p>

<p>If Kareem Hunt was still in the fold here, the Chiefs would be stacked in terms of offensive weaponry. However, booting him off the team left them without a reliable backfield option. Without a rusher that can both run and pass the ball, the team only has two notable dimensions of attack on offense. Even though Mahomes is capable of running the ball himself, his rushes and scrambles have been kept at a minimal rate this season, which leaves me with some doubt as to whether the team can safely rely on his ability to run the ball in order to move the chains.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-dee-ford-chris-jones-justin-houston">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Dee Ford, Chris Jones, Justin Houston</em></h4>

<p>The Chiefs are irrefutably the one team in the AFC with the best set of pass rushers. Before the season started, I would have been floored at the notion of Justin Houston only being the <em>third</em> best pressure defender on the team&hellip; but the reality is that Dee Ford and Chris Jones have taken major leaps forward this year when it comes to rushing the passer, each having logged  30 hits on opposing quarterbacks this season.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Justin Houston &ldquo;merely&rdquo; registered 15 quarterback hits this season and 28 solo tackles, but the man only played in 12 games this season. If you were to extrapolate his numbers over a 16-game period, Houston would doubtlessly be labelled elite.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>The Chiefs are fine here. All the key players here have postseason experience&hellip;except for one - Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes sat on the bench last year when the Chiefs lost their playoff opener against the Titans, so this year will actually be the first year Patrick sees real action in the postseason. I do not foresee this being much of a problem, though&hellip;the man has more than lived up to his billing as the starting quarterback this year. Nerves will rattle him at the start, but he&rsquo;ll shake them off fairly quickly.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-andy-reid-hc-eric-bieniemy-oc-bob-sutton-dc">Coach: <em>Andy Reid (HC), Eric Bieniemy (OC) Bob Sutton (DC)</em></h4>

<p>Andy Reid has always been a top-tier coach the past several years. Nothing this season has changed that. If anything, I respect Reid even more now, having brought out phenomenal performances from the young Mahomes so early into his career. The time he spends mentoring his quarterback during games has paid off in dividends, as it seems Patrick has continued to develop throughout the season, even as defenses began working harder to limit his game.</p>

<p>Bob Sutton, meanwhile, has been a bit of a mixed bag. The defensive line has taken some massive strides forward this year&hellip;but at the expense of the secondary. Kansas City may have one of the worst defensive backfields in the league. The team&rsquo;s affinity for man coverage schemes only exacerbates the shortcomings among the cornerbacks and safeties. But lately, the Chiefs have shown some considerable progress in coverage. Even though Seattle managed to post 38 points against this defense late in the season, the cornerbacks and safeties actually played well in that game. It was Russell Wilson&rsquo;s dime passing that allowed Seattle to produce so much on offense.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>Super Bowl favorites, easily. The Chiefs are likely the team to beat should any of the other teams with promise want to hoist the Lombardi Trophy this year.</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>New Orleans returns back to the postseason after a painful loss against the Vikings last year in the division round. The Saints stand as the top seed in the National Football Conference.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-drew-brees">Quarterback: <em>Drew Brees</em></h4>

<p>Drew Brees is an MVP candidate for a reason. Yes, a few of his games this season have been completely ordinary. But the eye test and the statistics irrefutably validates his status as an elite quarterback. Forget passer rating&hellip;just look at his deep passing statistics - Brees stands as one of only 4 quarterbacks this season to have completed over 50% of his deep passes.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-michael-thomas-alvin-kamara">Offensive Weapons: <em>Michael Thomas, Alvin Kamara</em></h4>

<p>Both players have done more than enough to merit inclusion on this list. Thomas and Kamara have continued performing at a high level after a Pro Bowl year last season. Mark Ingram, on the other hand, has dropped off a cliff. Not only has he lost his status as the team&rsquo;s bell cow at running back, but his receiving numbers have dropped off by roughly 60% from last year. It wasn&rsquo;t just Kamara that cannibalized Ingram&rsquo;s numbers this year - Taysom Hill has been stealing some carries away from Ingram as well.</p>

<p>Generally, I recommend that a team have at least 3 offensive skill players that can be put on this list. The Saints clearly fall a bit short on that, though certainly not for lack of trying. New Orleans did try to work Brandon Marshall and Dez Bryant into the fold, but neither player actually found their way on the field. And none of their depth receivers have been able to contribute consistently. Tre-Quan Smith seems like the most promising pass-catcher on the team after Michael Thomas, but the man has only had two big games this season.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-cameron-jordan">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Cameron Jordan</em></h4>

<p>I initially had some trouble here. While I had little doubt Cameron Jordan deserved a spot here, my dilemma was whether I should include Sheldon Rankins as well. After all, Rankins was statistically the second best pass rusher on the team, tallying 15 hits on opposing quarterbacks during the season. So I decided to watch footage from a recent game where he registered a good number of hits - the game at Tampa Bay.</p>

<p>I saw little from Rankins for the first three quarters. But then the man came alive in the fourth quarter. On the Buccaneers&rsquo; last three drives, Sheldon booked a sack and two hits. Still, his absence the rest of the game worried me. If anything though, another player impressed me at times - Marcus Davenport.</p>

<p>I literally just noticed that Davenport only played in 13 games this season, having taken 3 game off to heal up an injured toe. And from what I read, it seems that toe injury hindered his play style his first couple games back. If you take away the games where he couldn&rsquo;t allegedly perform up to potential, the rookie edge rusher comes away with 12 hits over 11 games. Not too shabby. So if anything, an argument can be made to include Davenport on this list.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>Most of the team that played last year in the postseason will be playing again this year. Only the defense have significant players that will be making their playoff debut in two weeks - edge rusher Marcus Davenport, defensive back Eli Apple, and linebacker Demario Davis. So inexperience will be a trivial matter for this team.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-sean-payton-hc-dennis-allen-dc">Coach: <em>Sean Payton (HC), Dennis Allen (DC)</em></h4>

<p>Payton and Allen have continued marshaling some fine performances from this team. But in talking about these coaches, I want to bring light to something here - it&rsquo;s the ways the Saints manage to win games. Compare the games against Los Angeles and Minnesota here. Against the Rams, New Orleans clobbered them offensively to the tune of 487 yards. That production on offense and some help from special teams was enough to overcome the defense giving up 483 yards of their own to the Rams offense.  Against the Vikings though, the Saints were able to win that contest thanks to a masterful showing from their defense. With the offense performing at a mediocre level, the defense picked up the slack and carried the team to a primetime road victory.</p>

<p>So the fact that the Saints can tick off wins even when one unit underperforms reflects highly on the coaching.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>The Saints biggest obstacle in the NFC are the Eagles. If the Eagles falter for any reason or are simply not playing up to potential, expect New Orleans to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.</p>

			<p>Deshaun Watson&rsquo;s return from ACL injury started out a little sloppy, to be honest. But once the team finally settled into a rhythm, the team won 11 of their last 14 contests, which netted them the 3rd seed in the American Football Conference.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-deshaun-watson">Quarterback: <em>Deshaun Watson</em></h4>

<p>The man truly earned his stripes this season. You see, for much of the season, Watson was forced to play without much talent in the receiver position. Not only that, but his offensive line consisted of nothing but traffic cones. Actual traffic cones. Opposing pass rushers were literally treating themselves to sacks game after game after game. And yet despite all these drawbacks , Deshaun was able to engineer enough offensive production to win games. Even when the team would fall way behind, the man found ways to fight back and make games more competitive. So there is absolutely no doubt Deshaun Watson can be classified as an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-deandre-hopkins-deshaun-watson">Offensive Weapons: <em>DeAndre Hopkins, Deshaun Watson</em></h4>

<p>DeAndre has been the only reliable pass catcher on the team. Really, it seems like Hopkins is the only receiver Watson fully trusts as of lately. Which is a bit of a damn shame - the team actually has a solid trio of receivers in DeAndre, Will Fuller, and rookie Keke Coutee. The problem here is that Fuller is out for with a season with a torn ACL and Keke Coutee has been dealing with lingering injuries that have kept him out of 10 games this season.</p>

<p>The depth receivers have been serviceable, but none of them can produce on a consistent basis. Luckily, the team had an added dimension to their offense that they can count upon when the air game stalls - Deshaun&rsquo;s ability to scramble and run with the ball. Similar to Mitch Trubisky, Watson has been magical matriculating the ball down the field with his scrambles and improvised runs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Lamar Miller had flashes of brilliance this season, but injuries have slowed him down as well. And really, it&rsquo;s worth repeating an earlier point - that injuries have compromised much of this offense. If this team was fairly healthy coming into the postseason, I would consider them to be a Super Bowl favorite.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-jj-watt-jadaveon-clowney">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>JJ Watt, Jadaveon Clowney</em></h4>

<p>Both JJ Watt and Jadaveon Clowney have been beastly this season. Watt has been absolutely phenomenal has been edge rusher. Likewise, Clowney has been consistently dominant rushing the passer from all sorts of starting points.</p>

<p>A case can be made for Whitney Mercilus to be included on this list as well. His numbers look sexy as well. A few more quarterback hits and I&rsquo;d definitely throw him on this list.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>A fair number of players on this team are only two years removed from playoff experience. The team is not as green as I initially thought.</p>

<p>The only issue might be Deshaun Watson. This would be the first playoff game of his career. Normally, I&rsquo;d say nerves could be an issue here&hellip;but the man is only two years removed from playing in the college national championship. If he can channel that rugged mentality that helped him win that game, he should be fine.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-bill-o-brien-hc-romeo-crennel-dc">Coach: <em>Bill O&rsquo;Brien (HC), Romeo Crennel (DC)</em></h4>

<p>Unfortunately, Bill O&rsquo;Brien has not been a great coach this year. While he deserves credit for helping the team bounce back after an 0-3 start to the season, O&rsquo;Brien has shown his limitations as well, particular when it comes to fixing weak points on the roster and adapting with the times.</p>

<p>Take the offensive line, for example. His offensive line has been a train wreck, largely because his tackles have been utterly inept at pass protection and run blocking. O&rsquo;Brien has done little to fix this issue, though he hasn&rsquo;t been helped by injuries to Seantrel Henderson.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just roster management - his crippling conservative approach to game management has been infuriating and even costly. The Philadelphia game best demonstrates this - whereas Doug Pederson had no qualms putting his offense out there on 4th downs, Bill O&rsquo;Brien repeatedly refused to give his offense any opportunities to convert 4th downs, even when only a few yards were needed to move the chains.</p>

<p>On a positive note though, he&rsquo;s taken the Texans to the playoffs three of the last four years, so there&rsquo;s something to be said about his coaching.</p>

<p>The Texans could go as far as the conference championship. And with some luck, Houston could possibly win the Super Bowl this year. But at the very least, I do expect the Texans to play in the division round against the Patriots.</p>

			<p>The Steelers slipping out of playoff contention allowed the Indianapolis Colts to work their way into the postseason as the sixth seed of the American Football Conference. How far will Andrew Luck go in his comeback year?</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-andrew-luck">Quarterback: <em>Andrew Luck</em></h4>

<p>Luck will win the Comeback Player of the Year award. Nothing else needs to be said. Under Frank Reich, Luck has not only regained his old form, but adopted a quick release into his passing style. Even though statistics rarely tell the full story on a quarterback&rsquo;s performance in a given season, Andrew Luck&rsquo;s year can actually be summed up fairly well by two simple data points - 39 touchdowns thrown en route to a 4500 yard season. Pretty damn good.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-t-y-hilton-eric-ebron-marlon-mack">Offensive Weapons: <em>T.Y. Hilton, Eric Ebron, Marlon Mack</em></h4>

<p>Luck&rsquo;s success this year rubbed off on Eric Ebron, a man I was ready to write off as a draft bust. Under the tutelage of Andrew Luck and Frank Reich, Ebron revamped himself into a top-tier tight end. Not only does Luck love throwing the ball to him in the end zone, but he&rsquo;s one of Andrew&rsquo;s two favorite options on third down. T.Y. Hilton is that other skill player Luck consistently relies upon on to convert third downs, which shouldn&rsquo;t be much of a surprise.</p>

<p>What may be a bit of a surprise is Marlon Mack&rsquo;s inclusion on this list. The changes the Colts made to the offensive line over the offseason served the  young man well. With an offensive line that can actually push defensive linemen around, Mack produced nearly 1000 yards rushing from scrimmage, at nearly 5 years per attempt.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-n-a">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>N/A</em></h4>

<p>We have a problem here. The Colts have no studs lining up on the defensive line. Jabaal Sheard may be the best lineman on the team, but he&rsquo;s designed to stop the run, not rush the passer.</p>

<p>Without a single elite pass rusher, the Colts defense will be a massive liability.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>Yet another negative here. Quite a few people on the roster lack recent playoff experience. Key players like Andrew Luck and T.Y. Hilton last logged playing time in the postseason back in 2014, so it remains uncertain as to how quick these two (let alone other players) can adjust to the postseason environment.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-frank-reich-hc-matt-eberflus-dc">Coach: <em>Frank Reich (HC), Matt Eberflus (DC)</em></h4>

<p>Frank Reich has done well with a team that did fairly little during free agency. Not only do the Colts play much better than the sum of their parts, but he&rsquo;s successfully eased a shaken Andrew Luck back into the sport. Reich deserves commendations for the job he has done here. Honestly&hellip;I&rsquo;d vote him as the Coach of the Year.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>Kudos to the Colts for making the playoffs after such a horrendous season last year. That being said&hellip;the next game against Houston will be the last game of their season.</p>
