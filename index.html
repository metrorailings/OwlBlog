			<h2 id="tier-3">Tier 3</h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Joe Flacco, Drew Lock</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Emmanuel Sanders (WR), Phillip Lindsay (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Courtland Sutton (WR), Noah Fant (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Von Miller (DE), Bradley Chubb (DE), Chris Harris Jr. (CB), Bryce Callahan (CB), Derek Wolfe (DT)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>John Elway (GM), Vic Fangio (New HC), Rich Scangarello (New OC), Ed Donatell (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 7</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, only the running backs coach and the wide receivers coach from last year managed to survive the transition from the short-lived Vance Joseph era to the Vic Fangio regime.</p>

<p>Similarly on defense, only the defensive line coach and linebackers coach survived the coaching overhaul. Everybody else has been replaced or had their roles outright eliminated or revised into another role.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Broncos are experimenting yet again with another quarterback this season in Joe Flacco. Unfortunately, Flacco’s better days are far behind him. Joe Cool hasn’t had a successful season for a while. Maybe if Gary Kubiak was still around, Flacco would have a shot at being serviceable. But Kubiak isn’t there and Flacco isn’t likely to experience a resurgence in Denver anyway. Very few quarterbacks, if any at all, see a second wind at this point in their careers. John Elway did draft a quarterback prospect in Drew Lock this year, but it’ll take at least several weeks for Lock to return from an injury on his throwing hand. Honestly though, given Elway’s history picking and signing quarterbacks over the last couple years, I wouldn’t be holding out much hope here for the young rookie.</p>

<p>It’s not all that awful for the Broncos though. The team still has one of the best pass-rushing duos in the league in Von Miller and Bradley Chubb. They still feature a quality ground game headlined by Phillip Lindsay. They still boast the best home-field advantage in the league. And perhaps best of all, they actually have a manageable schedule this year.</p>

<p>We haven’t even addressed the coaching changes yet. Standing on the sidelines will be rookie head coach Vic Fangio, who has had a sensational career in the NFL as a defensive coach. While I can’t speak much about any of his coordinators or position coaches, Fangio’s reputation as a defensive mastermind gives me hope for the new coaching regime here. At the very least, the new coaches should be able to transform a defensive unit that underwhelmed last year.</p>

<p>Despite their quarterback situation, the Broncos have so many positive aspects about them that I project that this team will eke its way into the playoffs as a wild-card contender.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-3"><strong><em>Tier 3</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Nick Foles</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Keelan Cole (WR), Marqise Lee (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Leonard Fournette (RB), Dede Westbrook (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Calais Campbell (E), Yannick Ngakoue (E), Marcel Dareus (DT), Josh Allen (OLB), Myles Jack (MLB), Telvin Smith (OLB), Jalen Ramsey (CB), A.J. Bouye (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Tom Coughlin (Exec), David Caldwell (GM), Doug Marrone (HC), John DeFillippo (New OC), Todd Wash (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 7.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On the offensive side, quite a few of the assistant coaches from last year were retained, despite the hiring of a new offensive coordinator in John DeFillippo. Only offensive line coach Pat Flaherty and running backs coach Tyrone Wheatley were let go. While I don’t have much of an opinion on the latter, I can say that firing Pat Flaherty is likely a good move. Flaherty has been lousy at training up offensive linemen since his days with the New York Giants. Jacksonville’s ragged offensive line last year is yet another blemish on his resume.</p>

<p>On the defensive side, Perry Fewell was released from his duties overseeing the secondary in favor of a two-man coaching set-up. Furthermore, Dom Capers joins the staff as an advisor to Mark Wash.</p>

<hr />

<p>How wrong and right I was last year…</p>

<p>I was (pretty obviously) right in that Blake Bortles could torpedo this team’s Super Bowl hopes. But I was devastatingly wrong as to how low the Jaguars would sink if the Bortles train were derailed. Once Bortles lost whatever little confidence he had following a humiliating performance in Arrowhead, the rest of the team collectively gave up on the season. The defensive backs soon lost their swagger while the defensive linemen lost their cool. The locker room environment quickly became toxic, as defensive players were fighting one another and some of the offensive players were stewing angrily over their quarterback situation.</p>

<p>Anyway, the powers that be in Jacksonville eventually reached a hard conclusion - that the promised land would always be out of reach so long as a simpleton like Bortles continued helming their offense. So Bortles was let go and a four-year contract was dealt out to Nick Foles to replace him. Any hopes of the Jaguars making the postseason rests on the shoulders of the former Super Bowl MVP.</p>

<p>So can the Jaguars fight their way back to respectability this season? Sure, they can. Will they though? A few variables stand in the way of a solid prediction here. The biggest variable is whether John DeFillippo and Nick Foles could gel together. While DeFillippo worked well with Foles two years ago during Philadelphia’s championship run, he was only a quarterbacks coach then. It still remains to be seen whether DeFillippo is able to coach a competent offense as a coordinator. His last stint in that same role ended with him getting fired mid-season. A firing that was made all the more curious given that the Vikings have one of the best coaching staffs in the league.</p>

<p>Another major variable is whether Doug Marrone and Tom Coughlin can reinstill a sense of discipline in a team that lost its religion last year. And signs seem to indicate that the two men are doing a fine job so far at wrangling this team’s chaotic impulses. Nothing best exemplifies this then the way the team handled the contract situations for Myles Jack and Yannick Ngakoue. One of those two men actually showed up to all team activities and participated without complaining about ongoing contract negotiations. The other man did the opposite, protesting his contract situation by refusing to participate in any preseason team activities. The Jaguars management did the right thing and rewarded the team player while stalling contract talks with the player holding out. Decisions like that go a long way to building a culture that prizes teamwork and unity, the exact two things the Jaguars were missing last year.</p>

<p>Given that the Colts no longer have a franchise quarterback and the Texans are making stupid decisions in pursuit of some superficial show of championship potential, the Jaguars have a very real chance of winning this division outright. Much of that will depend on whether Foles can flourish under DeFillippo. So here’s hoping that DeFillippo can go back to his days in Philadelphia and find plays that bring the best out of his quarterback.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-5"><strong><em>Tier 5</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Deshaun Watson</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>DeAndre Hopkins (WR), Deshaun Watson (Mobile QB), Will Fuller (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Duke Johnson (RB), Keke Coutee (WR), Kenny Stills (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong>  <em>J.J. Watt (DE), Whitney Mercilus (OLB), Benardrick McKinney (ILB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Bill O’Brien (HC), Tim Kelly (New OC), Romeo Crennel (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 8.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover</strong></p>

<p>On the offensive end of things, Houston will now be shifting offensive coordinator duties away from Bill O’Brien. Oddly enough, the tight ends coach from last year will now be the offensive coordinator. A bit of a bizarre choice given that the tight end position group was arguably the weakest link of last year’s Texans. Besides that, the quarterbacks coach has been replaced with another journeyman quarterbacks coach.</p>

<p>On defense, every key coach from last year has been retained.</p>

<hr />

<p>So my analysis from last year was on point, except I underestimated how awful Bill O’Brien’s decision-making can get. His old-school thought process is not workable in today’s NFL. And frankly, it’s indicative of his limitations as coach. Good coaches adapt to the times. Mediocre coaches stubbornly cling to outdated traditions.</p>

<p>To his credit, the offense (when healthy) ran smoothly as O’Brien adjusted to his personnel on offense and drew up more pass-friendly schemes. The key here is health. Sophomore player Keke Coutee and speedster Will Fuller have to remain on the field for this offense to be functioning at an incredibly high level. Should Fuller, Coutee, Deandre Hopkins, and Deshaun Watson avoid major injury, this offense has the potential to be the best in the league.</p>

<p>The defense is still reworking things in the secondary. Kareem Jackson and Tyrann Matthieu were ousted in favor of Tashaun Gipson and Bradley Roby. Neither player is expected to elevate that sluggish passing defense. Once again, the performance of this defense will have to rely on JJ Watt, Jadaveon Clowney, and the other pass rushers being able to control the line of scrimmage this season.</p>

<p>That being said, I’m not sure I understand the thinking guiding the team’s management this year. The Texans are running experiments this year in the front office, purposely leaving the general manager role vacant in favor of a committee approach. Furthermore, O’Brien promoting the coach who oversaw the worst position group last year to the role of offensive coordinator this year leaves me even more wary. On paper, this team should be considered Super Bowl contenders. But the shaky management means that the team needs to be stacked from a talent perspective for me to have any confidence in their championship prospects. Anyway, I do expect another trip to the postseason this year, but that trip will be cut short early. Then again, a few key injuries on offense or defense would torpedo their postseason hopes.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>Two key players will likely not be playing for the Texans this year - Lamar Miller and Jadaveon Clowney. The former suffered an ACL tear during a preseason game while the latter will likely be traded away.</p>

<p>On Lamar Miller, his absence robs the team of depth in the backfield. While Duke Johnson is expected to step up as the team’s bellcow halfback, the Texans have nobody worthwhile behind him on the roster. Houston will be forced to go to the junk heap to pick up running backs capable of working relief duty behind Johnson.</p>

<p>On Jadaveon Clowney, the Texans are gambling here - the team will be relying on Whitney Mercilus or somebody else making up for Clowney’s pass rush production. If last year was any indication though, the team lacks players capable of consistently harassing quarterbacks outside of Jadaveon and JJ Watt. Speaking of which, it’s not even certain Watt can play through another season without injury given his past history. Should injury once again sideline him this year, Houston’s passing defense may be effectively reduced to shambles.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE 2</em></strong></p>

<p>The Texans made silly moves as training camp wounded down, sacrificing a boatload of high draft picks for an elite left tackle. Not only that, but Jadaveon Clowney was finally dealt out to the Seahawks for literal peanuts. And it reminds me that these Texans seems to do more things wrong than right as an organization.</p>

<p>I was looking at the coaching staff again and I realized that the offensive line coach from last year is still gainfully employed in the same position this year, despite Deshaun Watson being sacked more than any other quarterback in the league last season. It’s further proof that management cannot be trusted. And in football, coaching is just as critical (if not more) than roster talent. Therefore, I’m downgrading Houston here. And that means this team won’t be taking another postseason trip this year.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-4"><strong><em>Tier 4</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Jacoby Brissett</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>T.Y. Hilton (WR), Marlon Mack (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Eric Ebron (TE), Devin Funchess (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Notable Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Jabaal Sheard (DT), Justin Houston (DE), Darius Leonard (OLB), Pierre Desir (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Chris Ballard (GM), Frank Reich (HC), Nick Sirianni (OC), Matt Eberflus (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On the offensive side, we have a bit of turnover. The tight ends coach and the two offensive line coaches from last year were flipped for new folks. A little concerning considering both position groups were critical in the team’s recent resurgence.</p>

<p>On the defensive side of the ball, everybody was retained. But we do have a new addition in all-pro Robert Mathis, who will be assisting the defensive coaches in training up the pass rushers. Now this is a promising development. The one knock against this team last year has been its mediocre pass rush. Having a legend like Robert Mathis coach the front seven in that area should serve the team well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once again, my thoughts on this team’s prospects last year were just dismally off. I expected this team to be fighting amongst the bottom-feeders as it rebuilds from the Check Pagano era. Instead, the team advanced to the division rounds of the playoffs, losing to Kansas City as Andrew Luck struggled handling the frigid air at Arrowhead Stadium. Frank Reich deserves some major credit for turning this team’s fortunes around - in my opinion, the man should have been given the nod as coach of the year.</p>

<p>Anyway, given that most of the coaching staff has been carried over from last year and that the free agents swooped up this year should be able to contribute positively, this team should be considered Super Bowl contenders.</p>

<p>However, it’ll be hard for them to grab a high seed for the playoffs. The Colts have one of the harder schedules this year. But more importantly, the AFC South is not an easy division to play in - none of the teams in this division can be considered pushovers. Frankly, arguments can be made for all four teams emerging as division champions this season. And without a high seed, Indianapolis may be forced to play in cold environments during the playoffs. As I said before, Luck struggles playing in frigid air, having grown up and played college ball in the temperate climate of California. Then again, if the Colts finally develop a well-rounded defense, that may carry them through to the championship next February…</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>Andrew Luck has voluntarily retired. Tragic too - the young man may have been remembered as one of the greats had he seen his career through to a natural end. But injuries have robbed him of any joy he had for playing football. It was ultimately a decision he made for his own health, above everything else.</p>

<p>In his stead, Jacoby Brissett now steps in as the team’s primary signal caller. And that means the team can no longer be considered Super Bowl contenders. Even the playoffs may be out of reach for the team this year. Fact is it’ll take time for Frank Reich and his coaching crew to mold Brissett into a serviceable quarterback. That being said, that offense still has a fair amount of talent, especially along the offensive line. So Brissett has some help there. And while the Colts defense find themselves undermanned, the unit is not short on fight. So even though the face of the franchise is gone, don’t expect the Colts to be keeling over any time this season.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-6"><strong><em>Tier 6</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Marcus Mariota, Ryan Tannehill (Backup)</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Derrick Henry (RB), Delanie Walker (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Adam Humphries (WR), Marcus Mariota (Mobile QB), Dion Lewis (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Jurrell Casey (DE), Cameron Wake (OLB), Kevin Byard (SS), Adoree Jackson (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Jon Robinson (GM), Mike Vrabels (HC), Arthur Smith (New OC), Dean Pees (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 8</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Despite Matt LeFleur’s departure for greener pastures in Wisconsin, the team managed to retain the rest of its offensive staff. Tight ends coach Arthur Smith was promoted to the coordinator position this year.</p>

<p>On defense, we have no new faces. Every major staff member from last year has been retained.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tennessee has quite a few good things going for them - a charismatic head coach in Mike Vrabel, a coaching staff that’s almost wholly carried over from last year, and quite a bit of talent at select spots along their roster.</p>

<p>Still, Tennessee’s biggest problem has always been the durability of their franchise quarterback. Mariota can’t really lead this team to the next level from the sidelines. Sure, Tannehill can spell him here and there if need be&hellip;but Tannehill is no Nick Foles. The Titans need Mariota healthy in order to be considered a top contender. And there’s little evidence that he can stave off injury for an entire season, especially if he insists on running with the ball every now and then.</p>

<p>So I think Vegas is spot on with their assessment of the Titans as an unremarkable 8-win team. It’s hard to make a firm prediction here, as variance will likely dictate on what side of 500 they’ll land on this season.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>Michael Lombardi is reporting that the Titans seem to be losing confidence in Marcus Mariota. While Mariota has played well at moments, his career has been marred by injuries and <em>inconsistency</em>. The man has yet to put together a whole season of quality work. If the coaches genuinely believe Mariota isn’t the answer at offense, it wouldn’t surprise me if that lack of conviction infects the team with a sort of malaise that drags them down into the dregs as the season progresses. After all, these Titans are a team that generally perform well, but excel at nothing - Mariota is more or less the de facto face of this Titan team. I do believe the Titans will be the worst team in the division this year.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-2"><strong><em>Tier 2</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Ben Roethlisberger</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Juju Smith-Schuster (WR), James Conner (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>James Washington (WR), Vance McDonald (TE), Donte Moncrief (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Kevin Colbert (GM), Mike Tomlin (HC), Randy Fichtner (OC), Keith Butler (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, only the running backs coach has been formally flipped during the offseason. However, with Darryl Drake’s sudden death, the Steelers are now without their wide receivers coach from last year. Interestingly enough, it seems the team is content leaving Drake’s role vacant this year, maybe as a sort of tribute to him. One more thing worth noting&hellip;.Mike Munchak, the offensive line coach last year, left during the offseason to join Vic Fangio’s staff over in Denver - instead of shopping around for a new coach, the Steelers simply promoted his assistant to oversee the offensive line this year.</p>

<p>On defense, outside linebackers coach Joey Porter was fired during the offseason. Defensive coordinator Keith Butler will now be directly overseeing the outside linebackers on top of his regular coordinator duties. Other than that, the staff has remained intact from last year, save for the addition of Teryl Austin in an advisory role.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Steelers have finally rid themselves of locker room cancers in Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell. Some analysts predict a year of redemption for Ben Roethlisberger following a season dominated by petty drama and sloppy infighting. I say hold the brakes here. Even though Ben still has some life left in him, time is starting to wear him down. Last year, his quarterback play left much to be desired - mistakes were more common in his game than I could remember in years before. Perhaps nothing better exemplifies this than the game against the Broncos last year. Waning moments of the fourth quarter, third down, the Steelers are a yard or two away from tying the game up. In what looked like a run-pass option, Big Ben opted to pass. Except his pass ended up laughably short, right into the arms of a <em>defensive tackle,</em> of all people<em>.</em> It’s moments like these that make me wonder whether Roethlisberger can still demonstrate competence consistently enough to take this team far into the playoffs.</p>

<p>Now one could argue Ben’s job is made all the more difficult now that Antonio Brown is no longer with the team. While a valid point, I trust the Steelers brain trust to field a receiving corps that will far surpass expectations. After all, Mike Tomlin and his staff has had an entire offseason to scheme up a passing game that’s no longer headlined by Antonio Brown. So even if Pittsburgh doesn’t have a player of the same caliber as Brown, I do expect a few receivers to step up in his absence.</p>

<p>On defense, the team is looking more hopeful. T.J. Watt’s breakout last year was good news for a team that hasn’t had a dominant pass rusher the last few years (unless you count the aging James Harrison). The drafting of Devin Bush this year was yet another good move for a team that desperately missed the presence of an athletic linebacker. And the signing of free agent Steven Nelson should help shore up a secondary missing a legitimate cornerback opposite Joe Haden. If there is an area of concern, it’s depth - a key injury or two could cripple them defensively. Unless several other players step up, the Steelers need to hope the god of good health smiles upon them this year.</p>

<p>Overall, I expect a postseason berth. A Super Bowl is a possibility, albeit a remote one.</p>

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Baker Mayfield</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Odell Beckham (WR), Jarvis Landry (WR), Nick Chubb (RB), David Njoku (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Duke Johnson (RB), Antonio Callaway (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>John Dorsey (GM), Freddie Kitchens (New HC), Todd Monken (New OC), Steve Wilks (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>A new head coach brings quite a few new faces to the coaching staff. Todd Monken will now serve as the offensive coordinator. Interestingly enough, the running backs coach from last year, Ryan Lindley, has been retained as the quarterbacks coach for this year. I suppose it makes sense given that Lindley is a former quarterback. Anyway..the wide receivers coach has been retained for the same role as well. Otherwise, all the other people on the offensive coaching staff came with the new regime.</p>

<p>On defense, we see a bigger transformation. Save for the secondaries coach, the defensive coaching staff there has been completely revamped, with former head coach Steve Wilks now in charge as defensive coordinator.</p>

<hr />

<p>How quickly things (or rather, perceptions) change. The Browns went from being considered league fodder under Hue Jackson to now being hyped as Super Bowl contenders. And it’s hard not to be excited for the Browns. A talented quarterback entering his sophomore year <em>should</em> take some strides forward, especially with a receiving corps headlined by the likes of Odell Beckham and Jarvis Landry. The defense should improve as well now that Olivier Vernon will be joining Myles Garrett in the trenches - so long as the offense keeps the team playing from ahead, those two should have plenty of opportunity to hunt down opposing quarterbacks.</p>

<p>Even though he’s a rookie coach, Freddie Kitchens is seen as something of a tested commodity, having some success working with Baker Mayfield last year after Todd Haley was fired. After all, there’s a reason the Browns opted to promote Kitchens to head coach over the veteran Gregg Williams.</p>

<p>That being said, we must throw some cold water on the team’s championship prospects here. An entirely new coaching staff brings change&hellip;and change is something that takes time for players to absorb and handle. Furthermore, it remains to be seen as to whether Kitchens is ready for the stresses of being the lead coach. And honestly, there is reason to cast doubt. The team has been sensationalized in the media ever since Dorsey managed to poach Odell Beckham from the Giants. Instead of tamping down expectations and reminding the team that nothing great has been achieved as of yet, the coaches and management seem (more or less) content letting the spotlight rot this team’s collective psyche. Odell Beckham being a prima donna will not make things any easier for Kitchens - if the team goes into a slump, Odell will start chirping. In fact, his diva behavior has already been an issue this season when he opted to skip OTAs against his new head coach’s wishes.</p>

<p>The sportsbooks have upped the Browns’ win total to 9.5 this season, off the hype that followed the trade for Odell. It’s a very rosy outlook for a team buying too quickly into narratives about their greatness. I see the Browns ending this season with a last-minute push for the postseason that ends up falling just short.</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, we see quite a bit of reorganization this year now that Mornhinweg has been replaced with one of the main assistant coaches from last year, Greg Roman. Only one face is missing from last year - Thomas Hammock. Hammock left to become the head coach for a Division I college. In his former role is Matt Weiss, the wide receivers coach from last year. Speaking of which, the team’s only offensive coaching hire this year is David Culley, who’ll be overlooking the receiving corps now that Weiss will be managing the running backs. Kind of confusing how the Ravens shifted offensive coaches around different roles, though perhaps Greg Roman is simply trying to reorg his coaches where he best sees fit.</p>

<p>On defense, a new assistant coach has been added to train up the defensive backs. Other than that, everything remains the same from last year.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Ravens should do all right this season. The biggest question is whether Lamar Jackson can actually take that next step as a professional quarterback and commit more to passing the ball. Jackson is probably one of the two or three most athletic people in his position, but his skills as a traditional passer are just nowhere up to snuff. His balls are usually wide off the mark and his decision-making isn’t on point yet.</p>

<p>Luckily for the Ravens, Greg Roman is the type of man that can work with somebody like Lamar. Several years ago, Roman actually made Colin Kaepernick look competent for a whole season. Granted, Kaepernick was fortunate to be on such a strong team in the first place, but the fact that the 49ers went to the Super Bowl one year with Kaepernick at the helm of their offense stands as testament to Roman’s abilities to work with passers that prefer their legs over their arms. Also worth noting, the year after that, San Francisco fell just short of making the Super Bowl yet again with Kaepernick as their signal caller. So even though the Ravens have their work cut out for them, Roman should help make the situation a little easier.</p>

<p>The situation would have been so much easier had the Ravens actually surrounded their young signal caller with adequate talent. The reality here is that Baltimore lacks any dependable receivers that can help the quarterback, as (with one exception) the only skill players worthy of mention are either tight ends or halfbacks. Lamar needs those archetypical X receivers that can make circus catches every now and then. The Ravens have given him anything but that. Marquise Brown seems to be a positive step in the right direction, but it’s worth noting that man is more of a speedster than a jump receiver.</p>

<p>One more thing to talk about - defense. Baltimore had one of the best defenses last year. Not sure if that can be expected for this season though. Four key players were lost during free agency - C.J. Mosley, Za’Darius Smith, Eric Weddle, and defensive stalwart Terrell Suggs. While the Ravens did sign Earl Thomas to shore up the safety position, nothing else was really done to try and fill the vacancies left at other position groups by those free agents. It’s clear the team will be counting on depth players and draft selections to rise up and make this defense truly complete.</p>

<p>So their prognosis here is a middling season. Whether they end with a winning record and a possible postseason berth depends on variance. Given luck was probably on their side last year, I’m inclined to think this year will be a losing year for Baltimore.</p>
