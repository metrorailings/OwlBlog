	<div class='postTitle'>On Road Teams in the Playoffs</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to realize that road teams need to be truly stacked if they&rsquo;re going to be making a run in the postseason. Road teams need an elite quarterback, at least 3 different weapons on offense, and at least 2 stud pass rushers. Quality coaching is a necessity as well, but coaches can only work with the resources they&rsquo;re given.</p>

<p>So anything less than that and a road team will see its offense eventually stalled or its defense eventually victimized in the postseason. You can survive a few road games with talent deficiencies at those key positions, but eventually these road teams will run into astute coaches like Bill Belichick that know how to exploit those deficits.</p>

<p>The Chargers were eaten alive today in New England, mostly because their offense was limited and their defensive pass rush was virtually nonexistent. Belichick worked his magic and schematically shut down Keenan Allen and Melvin Gordon. Without either of those two producing on his offense, Philip Rivers had a hell of a time trying to score points for his team. His will to win is second to none, but the man can only go as far as his options let him. On defense, Joey Bosa revealed his true colors as a bust. I made a mistake considering him elite. It was an assumption rooted in his performance from last year, but injuries have rendered him rather ordinary this season. So without a a second major pass rusher to concern them, the Patriots were able to focus more resources on Melvin Ingram, effectively keeping Brady clean on the vast majority of his snaps.</p>

<p>The Eagles were handled in the Big Easy, as I discussed at length in my post-game comments on that game. What hurt Philly more than their spotty pass rush or questionable coaching calls&hellip;was their limited offense. The Eagles only field two solid weapons at offense. Take the both of them away and Nick Foles was left helpless. It also hurt that some of his passes were criminally under-thrown.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Saints over Eagles - Postgame Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Saints have bested the defending champions and have one more game to play before their trip to the Super Bowl. But first a couple thoughts&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the 3rd quarter, the Saints sustained a drive that lasted 11 and a half minutes. 11 and a half fucking minutes. It was amazing. It was a grueling crawl down the field, but the Saints were finally able to punch one past the goal line after 18 plays. Philadelphia needs to be admonished here, because the defensive line was completely walled during the whole drive. Had any of the pass rushers hit home just one or two more times, it might have been enough to prevent the Saints from posting 7 more points on board.</p></li>

<li><p>That being said, the Eagles&rsquo; pass rushers did have their moments from time to time. Arguably, it was thanks to the pass rush that the Eagles were able to stage one final drive to seize the game away from New Orleans. Unfortunately, that drive ended in a horrendous miscue from their top receiver, Alshon Jeffery. On top of that, the Eagles defensive line was absolutely vicious in the first half, stuffing runs at the line of scrimmage and haranguing Brees on a regular basis.</p></li>

<li><p>The biggest thing here is that the Eagles offense stalled from the second quarter onwards. After surrendering two touchdowns on defense early in the game, the Saints must have made a few adjustments on defense. From the second quarter onward, Philadelphia&rsquo;s longest drive lasted only 2 and a half minutes. One of the adjustments I did see happen involved putting the clamps on Alshon Jeffery by having Marshon Lattimore trail him in coverage. Marshon&rsquo;s physical dimensions actually make him better suited to defend jump-ball catchers like Jeffery.</p></li>

<li><p>But the reason why the Eagles ultimately stalled is because the offense was not dynamic enough. Even though Golden Tate shined last week, I was right in my initial assessment of him and other depth receivers on this team - Philly doesn&rsquo;t have anybody else that could solidly compliment the likes of Zach Ertz and Alshon Jeffery. Take those two players away and Nick Foles found himself holding on to the ball way too long for his own good.</p></li>
</ul>

	<div class='postTitle'>Patriots over Chargers - Post-Game Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>It&rsquo;s only halftime, but the Patriots are going to win this one. The game was over by the 2-minute warning in the first half.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Patriots are once again putting on a coaching clinic here. New England saw Los Angeles&rsquo; putting smaller bodies out there to defend the flat and decided that these smaller defenders would have trouble handling crushing runs right up the middle.</p></li>

<li><p>Outside of a single batted pass, Ingram and Bosa have been blanked in the first half. It&rsquo;s not easy dealing with the Patriots and their clever use of misdirection and quick passes, but both edge rushers have had opportunities to make their presence known and neither player has taken advantage of those opportunities. I think I&rsquo;ve been too generous classifying Bosa as an elite edge rusher. The reality is that he&rsquo;s not the same agent of havoc from last year.</p></li>

<li><p>The Chargers&rsquo; zone defense is worthless so long as the defensive front cannot muster any pressure. Elite quarterbacks like Brady will sit back and pick apart zone schemes.</p></li>

<li><p>It alarms me that this Los Angeles team that&rsquo;s getting so badly out-coached this game is the same team that dominated against the Ravens last week. It indicates to me that the Ravens sucked more on offense than I thought. Either that or run-first offenses can be easily stunted, especially if you&rsquo;re played that rush-heavy offense earlier in the season.</p></li>
</ul>

	<div class='postTitle'>Eagles @ Saints - Division Round Preview</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Philadelphia Eagles return to New Orleans in their quest to repeat as champions.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Division Round Analysis - Eagles @ Saints.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Eagles do not deserve to be such crazy underdogs in this match-up.  I know, I know Philadelphia was shellacked earlier in the year when these two teams met in the Superdome&hellip;but the postseason is different from the regular season. In the regular season, teams ebb and flow. And the Eagles were clearly trending down that week while the Saints were staking their claim as the cream of the crop in the NFC. Besides, Nick Foles wasn&rsquo;t even playing in that game!</p>

<p>Philadelphia has the more complete team while New Orleans has home field advantage. Yes, that&rsquo;s right&hellip;Philadelphia enters this contest with the better overall roster. Even though both teams only have two players on their offense worthy of being tagged as reliable offensive weaponry, the Eagles have more serviceable depth on that side of the ball compared to the Saints. Last week against the Bears, Golden Tate finally started proving his worth, catching 5 passes off 8 targets, including 1 reception for the game-winning touchdown. On top of that, Nelson Agholor has had a few brilliant moments over the past few weeks, especially on deep catches. As for the Saints, they don&rsquo;t really have many potentially solid depth receivers behind Michael Thomas. Only Tre&rsquo;Quan Smith has shown flashes here and there over the season, but it remains to be seen whether the rookie can contribute meaningfully in big-time situations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, compare the defensive lines on both teams. The Saints have two promising players lining up alongside Cameron Jordan - Sheldon Rankins and Marcus Davenport. But unlike Jordan, neither can be considered elite pass rushers this season. Meanwhile, the Eagles have three great pressure rushers, two of which I&rsquo;ve already classified as elite - Michael Bennett and Fletcher Cox. And it&rsquo;s vey debatable as to whether Chris Long should be considered a top-tier edge rusher as well. His pressure numbers would certainly justify such classification.</p>

<p>Coaching is a wash here, as both Sean Payton and Doug Pederson are great coaches, so neither team can claim an advantage there. So honestly, the spread for this game should be set far closer than what the books have listed. My biggest bet of the weekend will be on the Eagles spread. And in fact, Philadelphia can also win this game too, but only if the Eagles defensive linemen are able to consistently win the battle at the line of scrimmage. If the Saints defensive linemen have more of an impact than their Philly counterparts, the Saints should then start booking flights to the Super Bowl after the game ends.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Chargers @ Patriots - Division Round Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Chargers fly again to the east coast this weekend, this time to contend against the New England Patriots.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Division Round Analysis - Chargers @ Patriots.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Chargers nearly have a complete team. And it puts them in position to pull off an upset here. New England can still win this game, but it will not be easy. Los Angeles comes into this game with the superior pass rush, headlined by Melvin Ingram and Joey Bosa. I expect Tom Brady to be harangued regularly.</p>

<p>Hunter Henry also makes his season debut in this game. While his snap count will be limited, Henry could have a major impact, as the Chargers are missing that dependable tight end that can run all sorts of routes from the book-ends of the offensive line. Antonio Gates has been trying his best to fulfill that role this year, but age has caught up to him. It is worth noting though&hellip;that Gates was simply fantastic last game against the Ravens. His receptions on third down kept the chains moving on 3 of the Chargers&rsquo; scoring drives. Rivers came to rely on Gates more than Keenan Allen on third downs! So if anything, Los Angeles has some legitimate hope at the tight-end position - if Gates and Henry can work in tandem to provide Philip Rivers a reliable target at tight end, then Los Angeles winning is a very <em>very</em> real possibility.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not ready to crown Los Angeles as the favorite here. New England still deserves to be the favorite in this game. For all their shortcomings this year, the Patriots do have one thing that the Chargers don&rsquo;t have - the best head coach in the game. Bill Belichick is a legend. And I&rsquo;m not sure if Anthony Lynn is ready to match wits with Belichick. To his credit though, Lynn and his defensive coordinator Gus Bradley drafted a phenomenal game plan against the Ravens last week. So if anything, I&rsquo;ll be treating this game as the real litmus test to determine how far Anthony Lynn has come along the last few years as head coach. To be honest, I had little faith in the man before the season started. But this year&rsquo;s Chargers are a different beast, and the man needs to be given his due for the team&rsquo;s resurgence this season.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Rams over Cowboys - Post-Game Thoughts</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Some thoughts on the Rams first playoff win in the Sean McVay era&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Finally, the Rams have returned to their old successful ways from earlier in the season. With a healthier Todd Gurley and CJ Anderson finally brought up to speed on McVay&rsquo;s playbook, Los Angeles was able to pound the ball on the turf for 273 yards.</p></li>

<li><p>Being able to run the ball also opened up that other thing McVay loves to call - the crossing routes. And really, the man coverage schemes that Dallas runs on defense are mighty susceptible to those types of routes, especially if the linebackers are too preoccupied defending the run. As I expected, Jason Garrett and Rod Marinelli were averse to shifting defenders into zone coverage, even if playing zone would have put the defensive backs in better position this game.</p></li>

<li><p>Neither team was able to mount much of a pass rush, but the Rams&rsquo; defensive linemen generally saw more success than their Cowboys&rsquo; counterparts. Aaron Donald had his moments, as did Ndamukong Suh and Dante Fowler. Collectively, the defensive line&rsquo;s best play came on a 4th down late in the game, when Ezekiel Elliott was stuffed at the line of scrimmage.</p></li>

<li><p>Home field advantage is a hell of a thing sometimes. It&rsquo;s pretty clear the Rams were gifted a touchdown late in the game - the referees did not call holding on a Los Angeles offensive lineman that was pretty damn clearly holding a Cowboys defensive end illegally. Had the game been played in Dallas, I think the referees would have been bold enough to throw that flag.</p></li>

	<div class='postTitle'>Chiefs over Colts - Quick Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Just a few points to make about the Chiefs and their division round victory over the Colts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Any doubts I may have had about the Chiefs&rsquo; championship prospects have been quieted. All 3 of their star pass rushers made their presence known throughout the game. Mahomes played with some admirable composure in his first real postseason game. The running game came back alive behind Damien Williams. If the run game stays alive, Kansas City is easily the most complete team alive in the postseason.</p></li>

<li><p>The penalty bug seems to have passed from Houston over to Indianapolis. The Colts committed so many silly pre-snap penalties, some of which sustained key scoring drives for the Chiefs.</p></li>

<li><p>Andrew Luck and the offense seem&hellip;discombobulated? It looks to me that the Colts lost that offensive mojo that so many people and gamblers found so endearing. Andrew Luck had trouble connected with all of his major playmakers, especially T.Y. Hilton. Maybe Hilton&rsquo;s injuries finally caught up with him today? Or maybe it was the cold weather and snowy conditions that threw the Colts off into disarray.</p></li>
</ul>

	<div class='postTitle'>Cowboys @ Rams - Division Round Preview</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Ladyboys travel to Los Angeles to face off against the second-seeded Rams.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Division Round Analysis - Cowboys @ Rams.jpg" alt="" />The Rams are justifiably the favorites here. In all categories outside of coaching and home field advantage, the Cowboys manage draw even against Los Angeles. But it&rsquo;s that latter exception that should concern Dallas. Jason Garrett is still a questionable coach, especially on the road. His refusal to incorporate his quarterback&rsquo;s mobility into his offense is idiotic. The Cowboys desperately need another dimension of offense early in the year, but Garrett and offensive coordinator Scott Linehan simply refused to leverage the speed of their Dak Prescott&rsquo;s running ability. Even with Amari Cooper factored into things here, the Cowboys need more diversity on offense should they want to survive road playoff games. Now I did see Dak execute a few designed run plays last week against the Seahawks, but I still doubt whether Garrett truly wants his captain on offense running around.</p>

<p>Besides that, Jason Garrett made a few other questionable decisions over the course of the season. His refusal to be bold on 4th down at various points through the season, his willingness to play most of his starters the last week of the regular season&hellip;it&rsquo;s made me doubt him.</p>

<p>On the other side, you have Sean McVay, who has done a yeoman&rsquo;s work in hiding his quarterback&rsquo;s deficiencies for much of the season. Jared Goff has some fantastic statistics this season, but his games in Chicago and against Philadelphia have shown me that the second-year player has some notable drawbacks in his play. Without the benefit of a strong run game and playing from behind, the man wilts from the pressure. Todd Gurley is more important to the offense than Jared Goff, simply put. I don&rsquo;t mean to minimize Goff&rsquo;s role here, but Gurley is the foundational piece that motivates the entire offense.</p>

<p>So this game seems to have come down home field advantage and coaching, and I&rsquo;d much rather side with the wunderkind and Wade Phillips over Jason Garrett and his ilk.</p>
