			<h2 id="49ers-saints">49ers @ Saints</h2>

<p>As expected, the Saints are working the 49ers in the short game, as the Cardinals did not too long ago.</p>

<p>Absence of Jaquiski Tartt at deep safety made a difference on an intermediate throw to Jared Cook for a touchdown.</p>

<p>49ers picking on Eli Apple on three consecutive downs for big plays. Eli Apple seems to have a hard time guarding the slant.</p>

<p>49ers coming into this game well-coached and ready, given the success of their first drive.</p>

<p>Nick Bosa having an impact on this game, stunting the Saints on two downs.</p>

<p>Deonte Harris making his presence known as a speedster on offense.</p>

<p>49ers pass protection is holding up. Although it does help that the Saints are biting hard on play-action. New Orleans needs to play more assignments on defense. Kudos to Kyle Shanahan for outcoaching Dennis Allen though.</p>

<p>Good play-calling by Sean Payton right near the goal line. Called a power run on 3rd down that set up an easy quarterback sneak on 4th down.</p>

<p>The Saints defensive line are not winning upfront. Shanahan is punking this defense.</p>

<p>49ers seem to have three solid skill players on offense - Deebo Samuel, Emmanuel Sanders, and George Kittle. Also helps that the team can run the ball with a combination of different halfbacks. And unlike Kyle Shanahan&rsquo;s Falcons the year they went to the Super Bowl, this team may have multiple pass rushers worth a damn.</p>

<p>Nick Bosa can be designated an elite pass rusher. Nobody else has really impressed me as of yet on this 49er defensive front.</p>

<p>New Orleans doesn&rsquo;t have much of a pass rush in this game. Cameron Jordan may be the only elite pass rusher on that defense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chiefs-patriots">Chiefs @ Patriots</h2>

<p>Trick play by the Patriots for a touchdown - a sliding flea flicker. Well done by Josh McDaniels. Brady&rsquo;s pass was a bit underthrown too. Makes me wonder&hellip;</p>

<p>Chris Jones already working the interior of the Patriots offensive line. Him putting the heat on Brady ended a Patriots drive coming off a turnover.</p>

<p>Once again, Brady underthrowing yet another pass that might have put New England in fringe field-goal range.</p>

<p>Patriots pass rush is anemic. If New England, they may be able to thank Mahomes untimely hand injury for the cheap win.</p>

<p>Patriots struggling to run this ball. Their success has largely come courtesy of the pass.</p>

<p>Brady showing his age. A bad decision (abetted a bit by pressure) led to an interception deep on the Patriots side of the field.</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy making plays against the run, as an elite defender should.</p>

<p>Brady&rsquo;s depth receivers are letting him down. That and Kansas City has found a solution here with the blitz, apparently.</p>

			<h4 id="ravens-bills-5-5"><em>Ravens</em> @ Bills (+5.5)</h4>

<p>The Bills&rsquo; big win against Dallas may have been overblown, given Chicago&rsquo;s manhandling of the Cowboys last night.</p>

<p>But more important than that, the Bills still have a major problem guarding against the run. While they&rsquo;ve improved a little over the past few weeks, it&rsquo;s a problem that&rsquo;s going to linger for the whole season. And that weakness will be exposed in the worst possible way against a Ravens team that can run the ball a myriad of ways.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="49ers-saints-2-5">49ers @ <em>Saints</em> (-2.5)</h4>

<p>The 49ers and their defensive line concern me a bit, especially given the injuries along the Saints offensive front. Still though&hellip;from what I saw when the Cardinals played San Francisco twice this season, this 49ers defense can be picked apart with short passes and some creative play calling.  Fortunately for the home team here, short passes and imaginative plays are the two central pillars of their offense.</p>

<p>So long as Brees can rid himself of the ball before the 49ers pass rushers start invading his personal space, New Orleans has a good shot at the cover here.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="chiefs-patriots-3">Chiefs @ <em>Patriots</em> (-3)</h4>

<p>The Patriots looked horrendous last week in their loss against the Texans. And it&rsquo;s hard for me to envision somebody like Bill Belichick tolerating yet another bad performance from his team this week.</p>

<p>Still, even a good day on offense for these Patriots wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to secure them the win here and the possible cover here. No, what New England needs to do is dominate these Chiefs in the ground game. So long as the Patriots possess the ball here and keep Mahomes snaps to a minimal number, New England can outright win in dominating fashion. And that&rsquo;s possible given Kansas is absolute ass in defensing the run.</p>

<p>And even if the Patriots do give up the ball pretty quickly on a few drives, I would hope New England&rsquo;s solid defensive backfield will be able to stunt the Chiefs and their big play offense on more than just a few occasions.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="steelers-cardinals-2-5">Steelers @ <em>Cardinals</em> (+2.5)</h4>

<p>My faith in the Duckster last week paid off. But in the process, I lost some faith in him - his big plays are hit or miss. Thankfully, most of his plays last week were more successful than not. But then again, Pittsburgh had a reason to play ever harder than usual, given the way their first match against Cleveland ended. This week, that same motivation isn&rsquo;t there. And it should make things a tad bit easier for Kyler Murray as he and his Cardinals settle back into the thick of things after an embarrassing loss against the Rams last week.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh&rsquo;s defense does give up pass yardage.  And Arizona can throw the ball if necessary here. In this rebound spot, give me Arizona.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="seahawks-rams-pk"><em>Seahawks</em> @ Rams (PK)</h4>

<p>I do respect the Rams, but give me the MVP-caliber quarterback here over a quarterback way out of his groove this season. Still, it does worry me that the Seahawks defense chokes up lots of yardage to opposing offenses. Out of all my picks, I see this being the riskiest - if Seattle gives the Rams offense enough time to settle into a rhythm, expect a back-and-forth affair here.</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;ll take my chances with Russell Wilson over Jared Goff and a cooling Rams team any day of the week.</p>

			<h4 id="browns-steelers-2">Browns @ <em>Steelers</em> (+2)</h4>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel that the Brownies are walking straight into a trap here. Coming off a big win, facing off against a team that it just dominated a few weeks ago (which is now starting a third-stringer at quarterback, mind you)&hellip;the reasons are there to phone this game in, especially with Freddie Kitchens&rsquo; lackadaisical coaching.</p>

<p>The Steelers, on the other hand, should be hyped for this game. After being bullied by these fools just a few weeks ago, emotions are still very raw. I expect the Steelers&rsquo; defensive front to have a hell of a time shredding through Cleveland&rsquo;s offensive front. And if that holds true, Baker Mayfield will be reduced to mush here. On the other side, Duck Hodges will make just enough plays to &ldquo;upset&rdquo; the Browns here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> I was right enough here. Cleveland was actually pretty successful running and passing the ball in the 2nd quarter, but Pittsburgh&rsquo;s defensive front landed some hits on Baker Mayfield, one of which rendered his hand numb for the second half. Anyway, it was these constant hits that won the game for the Steelers.</p>

<p>Although&hellip;it also helps that the Duckster was able to launch a few deep balls thanks largely to Cleveland&rsquo;s poor pass rush affording him so much time in the pocket.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="redskins-panthers-10">Redskins @ <em>Panthers</em> (-10)</h4>

<p>Should I really pick middling teams as double-digit favorites? I guess we&rsquo;ll find out.</p>

<p>One thing to be said about Washington&hellip;.the Redskins are awful. <em>Just awful</em>. Nothing sums up their commitment to sucking ass better than their rookie quarterback, Dwayne Haskins. If the Panthers can rack up quarterback hits here and force some turnovers, Carolina can cover this spread.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong>  While I haven&rsquo;t seen this game and I doubt I will, I just want to note that the Panthers being unable to stop the only thing the Redskins do somewhat well on offense is disheartening. It&rsquo;s a stark reminder not to bank on middling teams as double-digit favorites.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="49ers-ravens-6"><em>49ers</em> @ Ravens (-6)</h4>

<p>From an Elo standpoint, the Ravens&rsquo; ranking is inflated. After that big win, this spread literally jumped up 2 to 3 points in their favor. A little bit too much of a jump given that the 49ers are one of the three best teams in this league. Their defense can certainly limit Lamar Jackson&rsquo;s production here.</p>

<p>The real question here is whether the 49ers can post points against a Ravens defense that has stepped up quite a bit over the past few weeks. And while I don&rsquo;t have too much faith in Jimmy Garoppalo dropping back with the football, I do trust Kyle Shanahan to find ways to scheme big plays to keep his team in contention.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> The 49ers were able to pull off the cover, thanks to some courageous play and some opportune fumbles. Still, watching the game leaves me wondering whether this was such a solid pick. The Ravens played like the better team in my eyes. San Francisco was unable to goad and harass Lamar as much as I initially assumed. On top of that, the Ravens were constantly making fools out of the front with their trick runs. In the end, I think the weather has as big a role here in my win as the 49ers offense did running the ball for over 150 yards.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="titans-colts-2-5"><em>Titans</em> @ Colts (-2.5)</h4>

<p>Indianapolis has been getting by this season thanks mostly to solid coaching and stellar offensive line play. However, without T.Y. Hilton and Marlon Mack,  the Colts will be relying on Eric Ebron, Jonathan Williams, and Zach Pascal to step up on offense. I&rsquo;m not sure those three are enough to notch points against a respectable Tennessee defense playing better now that a capable quarterback has brought life back into their offense.</p>

<p>If Tennessee can force some ugly throws and movements out of Jacoby Brissett, the cover and upset is pretty much guaranteed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> You know, if the Colts had a competent kicker, a win wouldn&rsquo;t have been too far out of reach though.</p>

<p>But they don&rsquo;t have one. And I knew that before the game. And without their star skill players, Indy&rsquo;s drives tended to end a good bit short of the end zone. It would only be so long before Derrick Henry and Ryan Tannehill would find their sea legs against a Colts defense that was wearing down over the game.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="rams-cardinals-3">Rams @ <em>Cardinals</em> (+3)</h4>

<p>Typically, I shy away from stock low situations, but the Rams are just awful, what with their offensive scheme having been decoded and Jared Goff flailing wildly behind an offensive line not affording him much protection. Los Angeles lost any sort of magic they had last year on offense.</p>

<p>The Cardinals, on the other hand, have been playing better and better with as the season progresses.  Kliff Kingsbury&rsquo;s willingness to modify his air raid strategy has paid off in dividends - Kyler Murray and the offense have been surprisingly productive the last several games. On defense, the team seems to be playing better too, led by their star players in Chandler Jones, Terrell Suggs, Patrick Peterson, and Budda Baker.</p>

<p>Given 3 points here, I&rsquo;ll side with the team showing more promise, even if this smells like a trap line.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> The Cardinals came out of their bye still half-asleep. If you manage a defense ranked near the bottom of the league, you&rsquo;d probably serve your team well spiking their coffees in the mornings following bye week. Instead, Arizona&rsquo;s defense barely showed up here as the Rams posted a record day on offense.</p>

<p>On second thought though, maybe it&rsquo;s not that shocking that Arizona came out so limp in this outing, given Kliff is still learning the ropes as an NFL head coach.</p>

			<h2 id="bears-lions">Bears @ Lions</h2>

<p>The Lions suck. Just something worth noting.</p>

<p>The Bears seem to suck more though. This new quarterback Brough is actually stepping up and making good plays in Chicago&rsquo;s loose zone coverage. Did the Bears&rsquo; defensive backfield come into this match not giving a shit?</p>

<p>The Lions suck, particularly up front. Their pass rush is virtually nonexistant. Despite the Lions&rsquo; hot start, the Bears have posted more yards on offense.</p>

<p>Detroit may be worse than the Giants at defense. I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-cowboys">Bills @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>The Bills have gotten a beat on this Cowboys passing offense. Though once again, the defense has been showing a vulnerability against the run.</p>

<p>The Cowboys&rsquo; offensive front has been a little overwhelmed today, likely because of carefully planned blitzes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-giants">Packers @ Giants</h2>

<p>Green Bay Packers two main cornerbacks like to place zone and stick to the far end of the field.</p>

<p>Saquon isn&rsquo;t that good in pass protection. And his vision as a halfback could use a bit more work, it appears.  Either that or Pat Shurmur needs to let Barkley be the type of runner he wants to be.</p>

<p>Once again, Green Bay does well on their initial scripted plays, then the offense falters very quickly afterwards.</p>

<p>Without the pass rush hitting home, the weak Giants secondary is left out to dry.</p>

<p>On offense, things aren&rsquo;t much better. Bungled snaps followed by a silly throw by Daniel Jones leading to an interception. This Giants product is a mess.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="raiders-chiefs">Raiders @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Seems the Chiefs defense has picked up quite a few of the Raiders tendencies on offense.</p>

<p>The Chiefs know the Raiders&rsquo; route tree about as well as the Raiders.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-cardinals">Rams @ Cardinals</h2>

<p>Play-action is just throwing this Arizona defense into a dizzy.</p>

<p>Interesting tidbit. The Rams defensive front is purposely stretching their outside arms as they&rsquo;re rushing through the offensive line in order to keep Kyler Murray from scampering out at a sharp angle.</p>

<p>Cardinals having trouble covering tight-ends.</p>

<p>These Cardinals defense is playing soft.</p>

<p>Cardinals soft-zone defense choked on a third-and-long.</p>

<p>The Cardinals and their soft zone choking even against crossing routes.</p>

<p>I wonder if the Rams defense is keying in on the Rams&rsquo; short passing attack.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="patriots-texans">Patriots @ Texans</h2>

<p>The Patriots are gambling with man coverage against the Texans stacked receiver corps. And it hasn&rsquo;t panned out - the Texans burned New England on two separate downs, the latter resulting in a Houston touchdown.</p>

<p>Patriots love to blitz. But zero blitzes only work against inexperienced quarterbacks.</p>

<p>Texans linebacker Jake Martin finally stepping as a capable pass rusher against a good right tackle in Marcus Cannon.</p>

<p>Some sloppy long distance defense and an assignment being missed led to a Patriots touchdown. Still, it seems the Texans may be onto something, assigning a defensive back to blanket New England&rsquo;s halfback in coverage. Without an outlet leaking from the backfield, Tom Brady is left in even more desperate straits.</p>

<p>The Texans may actually have a functioning secondary here.</p>

<p>Deshaun Watson is targeting Johnathan Jones with zest.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="49ers-ravens">49ers @ Ravens</h2>

<p>Marcus Peters having a bad day, giving up a long touchdown and missing a tackle that resulted in a 49ers first down.</p>

<p>The Ravens defensive coaches are drawing up some solid blitz schemes here. These blitzes are throwing Garoffalo off his game. A fumble and several bad throws so far.</p>

<p>Seriously speaking, Baltimore has been holding up very well in pass protection, probably thanks in no small part to the Ravens running game keeping defensive lines at bay.</p>

<p>Lamar Jackson&rsquo;s runs are so difficult to defend. His shiftiness, his speed, his fakes&hellip;almost impossible to counter.</p>

<p>The Ravens run defense still remains very questionable though.</p>

<p>Baltimore is a lot more willing to run offensive plays on 4th down given all their bells and whistles on that side of the ball.</p>

<p>Baltimore&rsquo;s receiving corps are more defined by their tight ends than their actual wide receivers.</p>

<p>Richard Sherman coming and making plays near the line of scrimmage.</p>

<p>Garoppalo hasn&rsquo;t been impressive in this game. A bad decision on third down ended a very promising drive. Not to mention he was bailed out by defensive pass interference on that drive anyway. I think the Ravens and their creative blitzes have warped the clock in his head.</p>

<p>Lamar&rsquo;s read-option runs are gashing this 49ers defense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-colts">Titans @ Colts</h2>

<p>So far, Ryan Tannehill performing adequately under pressure.</p>

<p>This game really does illustrate why quarterback play is so important towards sustaining a drive.</p>

<p>Titans sustaining a great drive with nothing but power runs and screens. Some great conditioning on this team.</p>

<p>The Titans ran a direct snap to Derrick Henry on 2nd and 11. Fascinating.</p>

<p>The Colts do enjoy their zone blitzes.</p>

<p>Tennessee running an up-tempo offense at times to gain a rhythm.</p>

<p>The Titans last touchdown came on a bit of a well-executed trick play.</p>

			<h2 id="giants-bears">Giants @ Bears</h2>

<p>Trubisky plays much better in a high-tempo offense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-patriots">Cowboys @ Patriots</h2>

<p>The Patriots will need to commit more to running the ball, as their passing game is still a mess when throws are not schemed.</p>

<p>Cowboys have seen some success running the ball. Nothing too consistent, but it seems like something that&rsquo;ll help them string a few plays together on a scoring drive.</p>

<p>These Cowgirls aren&rsquo;t equipped to play in wet and windy conditions. Their special teams also may present a serious liability.</p>

<p>Patriots pass protection has held up remarkably well now that Isaiah Wynn has been inserted back into the lineup.</p>

<p>A promising New England drive was stopped when Demarcus Lawrence and Michael Bennett finally stepped up and killed two run plays.</p>

<p>The Cowboys may have the worst special teams in the league. New England is exposing this unit as a joke.</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy may be the Patriots&rsquo; best pass rusher. I&rsquo;m waiting to see Jamie Collins really make his presence felt. But it&rsquo;s interesting that New England&rsquo;s best pass rushers are not necessarily people that specialize in trench warfare to begin with. Instead, New England seems more inclined to stationing more agile linebackers along the edges of their defensive front.. It&rsquo;s probably the reason why the team decided to jettison Michael Bennett earlier in the season.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="dolphins-browns">Dolphins @ Browns</h2>

<p>A gift of a pass interference call sustained a Browns touchdown drive.</p>

<p>Dolphins doing well limiting Nick Chubb&rsquo;s gains.</p>

<p>Is Miami seriously trying to play New England&rsquo;s style of defense without having any of the horses in the defensive backfield?</p>

<p>The Dolphins are just so bad running the ball. Just so bad.</p>

<p>Negative game script is not something the Dolphins tolerate well.</p>

<p>Just horrific coaching by Miami. The Dolphins tried to run a special teams trick play from several yards out by running the ball. This team isn&rsquo;t trying very hard to prepare.</p>

<p>Jarvis Landry emerging as the Browns&rsquo; best weapon on offense.</p>

<p>The Dolphins&rsquo; revamped pass coverage unit is not coping well with all the different weapons the Browns field on offense. That may be the critical difference in this game.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-49ers">Packers @ 49ers</h2>

<p>The 49ers have a pretty dominant defensive line, if that hasn&rsquo;t been emphasized enough before. Arik Armstead now wreaking havoc in the backfield when he lines up as an edge rusher.</p>

<p>The Packers lack diversity and creativity in their offensive playbook. Unlike Arizona last week, the Packers are not taking advantage of the 49ers&rsquo; tendency on defense to keep their cornerbacks off the receivers. Green Bay&rsquo;s offense should be dinking and dunking their way to points here. Instead, Rodgers is insisting on holding the ball here instead of simply taking what the defense is giving him.</p>

<p>Slants and digs are ripping apart this Green Bay coverage unit.</p>

<p>Cris Collinsworth is a goddamn moron sometimes.</p>

<p>Fred Warner stepping up nicely as the middle linebacker now that Kwon Alexander is out for the season.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Kyle Shanahan is calling the offense aggressively despite being up by multiple touchdowns. Interesting.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="buccaneers-falcons">Buccaneers @ Falcons</h2>

<p>Fuck me&hellip;I just realized that I picked the Falcons here largely because Atlanta is usually so well prepared against its division rivals. With this Tampa team under a new coaching regime, any intel the Falcons gathered before on Tampa Bay may have been rendered mostly moot. My assumption was invalid.</p>

<p>Tampa&rsquo;s run defense is for real.</p>

<p>Jameis throwing a perfect ball on a timing route for a touchdown.</p>

<p>Shaquil Barrett not falling for any of the Falcons&rsquo; play-action.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay starting this game with a number of miscues. A drop by their star wide receiver and two interceptions from Jameis.</p>

<p>The Buccaneers don&rsquo;t seem to care for any of Atlanta&rsquo;s play-action fakes.</p>

<p>Chris Godwin having an unreal game today, even catching Jameis Winston&rsquo;s errant passes.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay&rsquo;s defensive front is dominating this Falcons offensive line in the pass game.</p>

<p>Jameis Winston having a little bit too easy of a time connecting on deep passes against this Falcons zone coverage. Seems to me that while Atlanta seems to be blanketing Mike Evans with multiple defensive backs, Chris Godwin and other receivers are more or less being released into vanilla zones that are pretty easy to exploit.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="panthers-saints">Panthers @ Saints</h2>

<p>Panthers run defense is worrisome. Eight men in the box against a very heavy formation and Latavius Murray still ran in the touchdown.</p>

<p>Brees showing so much more of a willingness to throw the ball.</p>

<p>The Saints dominating without arguably their best player on offense in Alvin Kamara is noteworthy.</p>

<p>This Panthers defense is a sieve, at least up until opposing offenses make their way into the red zone.</p>

<p>Carolina Panthers making some hay using end-arounds and misdirection plays.</p>

<p>Carolina&rsquo;s offensive line blocking is suspect.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ravens-rams">Ravens @ Rams</h2>

<p>The Rams edge defenders are having a really hard time containing runs that veer to the outside. These Raven halfbacks are gashing the Rams defense on the outside. Not to mention Rams defenders are playing nowhere near as physical as this Ravens offense right now.</p>

			<h4 id="broncos-bills-4">Broncos @ <em>Bills</em> (-4)</h4>

<p>A bit of a risky pick given that the Broncos can run the ball behind Philip Lindsay and the offensive coaching staff has shown a penchant for trickery, but this Bills defense is overall much better than a Broncos offense led by a quarterback that has yet to show he can play dropback football.</p>

<p>Plus the injuries along the Broncos offensive line should present pass-rushing opportunities for this Bills front seven.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> The game went as expected, more or less. The Bills defense exposed Brandon Allen as a sham.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="lions-redskins-3-5"><em>Lions</em> @ Redskins (+3.5)</h4>

<p>I still have absolutely zero faith in an entitled Dwayne Haskins and a Redskins team mired in a toxic environment.</p>

<p>That and Jeff Driskel impressed me in his outing against the Dallas. He was fearless with his passes, almost to the point of recklessness. Driskel is not afraid to chance those big plays. Even if the Lions are without the services of their best pass rusher in Trey Flowers, does it really take much to throw Haskins off his game, especially considering his reputed aversion to throwing in tight windows.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> I forgot how pathetic these Lions can be. As Brandon Allen demonstrated, one good game is too little a sample size to judge a quarterback, especially when that quarterback doesn&rsquo;t have much of a rushing attack or defense that can bail him out of bad decisions.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="dolphins-browns-10-5"><em>Dolphins</em> @ Browns (-10.5)</h4>

<p>I cannot trust these Browns as double-digit favorites against anybody, even the worst team in football. And missing the only three players on this team that can rush the passer should give Tannehill and his skill players enough opportunities to post points on the board. I don&rsquo;t expect the Dolphins to win, but I do expect Miami to score just enough to keep the game within two scores.</p>

<p>Besides, even if the Dolphins stall on offense, hopefully they can be bailed out by penalties that the Browns love committing.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> Well, Ryan Fitzpatrick almost managed to come back and cover in this one, but alas&hellip;it was not meant to be. The Dolphins makeshift defensive backfield could not contain all the skill players the Browns fielded. That was the fundamental difference in this game.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="buccaneers-falcons-4-5">Buccaneers @ <em>Falcons</em> (-4.5)</h4>

<p>Once again, the Falcons played incredibly well against another division opponent last week in the Panthers. Why expect anything different from a Tampa Bay team that&rsquo;s been drastically underperforming this season? Not to mention that Atlanta&rsquo;s recently revived pass rush should force Jameis Winston into a few errors.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> Maybe the Falcons doing well against division opponents the last two years was more noise than actual meaningful data from which we can extrapolate future performances. Or maybe Dan Quinn and his staff might have been a tad too unfamiliar with Tampa Bay&rsquo;s new coaching regime to properly plan around their tendencies on offense and defense.</p>

<p>Either way, Atlanta was never completely out of contention here until the second half. Despite that, it wasn&rsquo;t a pretty day or the Falcons offense - Matt Ryan was under duress on every drive. The Buccaneers defensive front consistently won their battles in the trenches. Furthermore, Ryan himself was noticeably more off than I expected - maybe a sign of old age rearing its ugly form here? Not too sure, but questions persist as to whether Ryan is still one of the league&rsquo;s better quarterbacks. The legitimacy of these questions makes Atlanta&rsquo;s offensive line issues all the more worrisome.</p>

<h4 id="jaguars-titans-3">Jaguars @ <em>Titans</em> (-3)</h4>

<p>The Titans are seen on the same level as the Jaguars according to the sportsbooks and I am not sure why. Yes, the Jaguars were able to pull out a great win when these two teams battled earlier in the season, but that victory was partly fueled by Jaguars players playing past their pay grade thanks to an emotional high due to the sudden emergence of sixth-round rookie Gardner Minshew. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the Jaguars were held in check for much of the game. It was a few big passes to receivers running outside the numbers that was the key difference.</p>

<p>Besides, the Jaguars run defense has been exposed over the past couple weeks. The Titans want nothing more than to run the ball at will, so this weakness plays well into Tennessee&rsquo;s strength here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> Went just as expected. The Titans dominated the Jaguars with both power runs and intermediate passes off play-action.</p>

			<h2 id="texans-ravens">Texans @ Ravens</h2>

<p>Matthew Judon dominating against the run and at taking down the quarterback.</p>

<p>Deshaun Watson seems to be leaning too heavily on DeAndre Hopkins in the passing game. Lots of slants and even a deep heave in his direction on a critical 4th down play.</p>

<p>Ravens&rsquo; defensive line has been a little sloppy with their aggressiveness. One bad penalty sustained an ultimately fruitless Texans drive.</p>

<p>Houston&rsquo;s pass rush is nonexistent, as expected. Mercilus, Reader, nor Brennan Scarlet.</p>

<p>The Ravens and their cadre of tight ends are unique in this league. Mark Andrews catching a touchdown pass against a cornerback demonstrates his value as a pass catcher.</p>

<p>Lamar Jackson and his ability to break tackles is really something special. His patience with the ball also impresses me.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-buccaneers">Saints @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Once again, Brees and Thomas haven&rsquo;t missed a beat with their connection whenever the latter runs flat routes.</p>

<p>A bungled snap from Jameis nearly cost the Buccaneers a possession one yard away from the end zone. Luckily, the sack created additional space for the Tampa Bay offense that allowed Jameis to slide the ball towards a halfback running a post route against a linebacker for a touchdown.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting studying this game to see if the Saints can work out of negative game script given Brees and his penchant for the short ball. So far, one drive ended because of a negative play.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-lions">Cowboys @ Lions</h2>

<p>Jeff Driskel is one hell of a mobile quarterback himself. Not like Lamar Jackson, but still pretty good in his own right.</p>

<p>Driskel&rsquo;s decision-making is suspect. Opted to throw the ball instead of running for what might have been a first-down.</p>

<p>Detroit&rsquo;s defense is just not physical enough compared to this Dallas offense. Jason Witten caught a ball against a defensive back in his hip pocket. Amari Cooper made a catch against a pass that should have been picked off by Darius Slay. Blitzes are just not hitting home. Dak Prescott is breaking out of sacks long enough to throw completions.</p>

<p>Detroit rushing only 3 people on a critical 3rd down is just pathetic. Matt Patricia thinks way too highly of his coverage people.</p>

<p>Dallas is trying to close out this game on an aggressive note, interestingly enough. Dak is handling the ball much more than Zeke.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="patriots-eagles">Patriots @ Eagles</h2>

<p>Dallas Goedert stepping on a big screen.</p>

<p>Philadelphia&rsquo;s secondary is holding up well against the Patriots receiving corps now that they&rsquo;re healthy.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="broncos-vikings">Broncos @ Vikings</h2>

<p>Denver coming out with a creative offensive concept on a shovel sweep.</p>

<p>Courtland Sutton is the man.</p>

<p>Broncos showing confidence in Brandon Allen, having him throw 3 straight times on a goal-to-go situation.</p>

<p>Some fantastically creative play-calling from the Broncos offensive coaching staff. A wildcat play transformed into an end-around that then became a successful passing play. Then Denver ran a similar play right afterwards with mostly the same personnel, but ran the ball this time around.</p>

<p>Defensive tackle Purcell has been a beast against the run for the Broncos.</p>

<p>Two horrible passes from Brandon Allen on red-zone-to-go drives. Second pass resulted in an interception. Dropback football is not his strength.</p>

<p>Broncos defensive line not yielding at all against the run.</p>

<p>Devontae Harris may be a serious liability in pass coverage. Big throws in his direction resulted in a Vikings touchdown.</p>

<p>Vikings adjusted in the second half by doubling Courtland Sutton on key downs.</p>

<p>Denver and their 3-man pass rushes&hellip;..why? You let up a big pass that sustained a Vikings drive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chiefs-vs-chargers-mexico-city">Chiefs vs Chargers (Mexico City)</h2>

<p>Philip Rivers&rsquo; depth of target has been unusually short so far. Though as I write this, Rivers finally threw a deep ball to Mike Williams. That pass was underthrown though.</p>

<p>Rivers just threw an interception on an intermediate throw. Think it might be time for him to retire?</p>

<p>The Chargers&rsquo; rookie left tackle may be a liability.</p>

<p>If the Chargers are to win this game, the win will have to come through the ground game unfortunately.</p>

<p>The Chargers love to drain that play clock for some reason.</p>

<p>Patrick Mahomes with the excellent touch passing.</p>

<p>Chargers shooting themselves in the foot now with defensive penalties, including a penalty that negated a fumble recovery.</p>

<p>Two legitimate pass interference penalties against the Chiefs paved the way for a Chargers touchdown.</p>

<p>Chargers are just a sloppy bunch. Not to mention their defense seems too happy to drop back deep. Though it may be worth noting the linebackers may only be dropping back deep in order to counter Mahomes&rsquo; penchant for the big play.</p>

<p>Pass defense from the Chiefs have stepped up tremendously.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-dolphins">Bills @ Dolphins</h2>

<p>Josh Allen doing serviceably well matriculating the ball through short and intermediate passes.</p>

<p>Vince Biegel of the Dolphins stepping up in defensing the run.</p>

<p>The Bills front seven are shuffling quite a bit around the line of scrimmage, creating confusion and opening up blitz opportunities right up the middle.</p>

<p>Miami is just hopeless at running the ball, apparently. Their wildcat plays, on the other hand, are promising.</p>

<p>Buffalo has been playing pretty aggressive here, even in the 4th quarter up by two scores.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jaguars-colts">Jaguars @ Colts</h2>

<p>Nick Foles did not do a good job of sniffing out a blitz from the Colts. Good job by the Colts, though, blitzing against an overmatched Jaguars offensive line.</p>

<p>The Jaguars are pretty awful at defensing the run. Notably, the linebackers seem easily duped on misdirection plays.</p>

<p>Nick Foles seems too overdependent on DJ Chark to catch his passes.</p>

<p>Leonard Fournette is truly terrible running from a shotgun look. Abandons the inside zone entirely on a handoff from Foles.</p>

<p>Wide receiver screens are a favored play on third downs for this Jaguars offense.</p>

<p>Jacksonville&rsquo;s linebackers are incredibly slow and easy to fool, once again.</p>

<p>Two poor decisions by Foles. Missing open receivers that he should have perhaps picked up on pre-snap. His throws on short crossing routes also tend to be high.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-49ers">Cardinals @ 49ers</h2>

<p>49ers defensive backs are playing off the receivers, almost as if San Francisco&rsquo;s defensive coaches have pegged Arizona is a team known for their deep passing instead of their quick releases and run game trickery.</p>

<p>Sherman failing to adequately cover Christian Kirk on two downs led to big plays that put the Cardinals in a goal-to-go situations on both occasions.</p>

<p>Wide receiver screens are killing this 49ers defense. San Francisco just faced this Arizona squad two weeks ago. Did they not learn anything about this Cardinals offense in that first outing?</p>

			<h4 id="saints-buccaneers-5-5"><em>Saints</em> @ Buccaneers (+5.5)</h4>

<p>Not the biggest fan of taking road favorites, but the Saints are coming off a horrific loss to an opponent that really had no standing to beat them. New Orleans clearly lost focus coming off the bye. That focus should be in place after the loss.</p>

<p>Now cue this game against the Buccaneers. As I noted before, Tampa Bay has a tendency to struggle against division opponents. While I can&rsquo;t say for sure why, it may be related to the fact that division opponents have more inside information about Jameis Winston and his sloppy tendencies. Carolina shellacking the Buccaneers in their second go-around is evidence of this, though it&rsquo;s worth noting that game took place in London.</p>

<p>Regardless, I expect those same struggles to surface again here against a capable Saints defense, even if it&rsquo;s missing the services of its best defensive back in Marshon Lattimore.</p>

<p>The only thing that concerns me is Drew Brees&rsquo; unwillingness to throw deep against this season. It seems age caught up to him. Either way, he&rsquo;ll need to throw deep against a secondary riddled with weak points all over should New Orleans want to win comfortably.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="falcons-panthers-5-5"><em>Falcons</em> @ Panthers (-5.5)</h4>

<p>Does Kyle Allen really deserve to be a 5.5 point favorite against anybody in this league aside from the Bengals? Maybe he&rsquo;ll prove me wrong Sunday, but I doubt it. He still has his issues, though he does tend to play better at home.</p>

<p>But this Panthers defense has been suspect for some time now and I expect the Falcons to put up points so long as Julio Jones can shed James Bradberry off him and Calvin Ridley can step up now that Austin Hooper will be out indefinitely. It also helps that Atlanta is so much better against their division rivals than against other teams - Quinn&rsquo;s approach of spending more time in practice focusing on their division cohorts has paid off here.</p>

<p>Besides, Dan Quinn&rsquo;s recent hands-on approach with the coaching of the defensive line has already yielded promising results against the Saints last week. Even if the Falcons pass rushers don&rsquo;t enjoy the same success they saw in Louisiana last week, it shouldn&rsquo;t take as much pressure to rattle an unseasoned quarterback like Kyle Allen.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="texans-ravens-4">Texans @ <em>Ravens</em> (-4)</h4>

<p>I shied away from this match initially as both teams are too good for me to have any confidence betting one side. But upon further examination, the Ravens have the better head coach, the better set of pass rushers, the home field advantage, and the better overall energy. Generally put, Baltimore is the better team here.</p>

<p>That being said, it does worry me a bit that the Texans are coming into this game with the comeback kid at quarterback and his full complement of receivers. Deshaun Watson has been damn near phenomenal in his short career so far whenever he mounts comebacks. And he could do the same here against a Ravens team trying to salt this game away late in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>Still, Baltimore had experience this season defending against a sensational quarterback in Russell Wilson. That game ended up being Seattle&rsquo;s worst showing this year, as the Seahawks lost control of the game in the fourth quarter. The Ravens coasted to a victory in that match. Maybe the same happens here&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="cardinals-49ers-11">Cardinals @ <em>49ers</em> (-11)</h4>

<p>Give me the elite defense here hurting off a bad loss and playing against a rookie quarterback limited by a playbook built mostly around quick passes and misdirection plays. If the 49ers force the Cardinals to play classical dropback football here, things won&rsquo;t end well for Arizona.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="chiefs-vs-chargers-3-5">Chiefs vs <em>Chargers</em> (+3.5)</h4>

<p>Always a risk to pick against a good team in Kansas City, but the Chiefs are not stout at all on defense. The offense will need to outgun opponents to win decisive matches, but the Chargers are difficult to outgun given their talent on offense, starting with quarterback Philip Rivers.</p>

<p>Besides, I do respect Anthony Lynn&rsquo;s attempts to prep his team to play this game in the high altitudes of Mexico City. Unlike Andy Reid, who seems content letting his team practice as if this were any other game, Anthony Lynn is forcing his team to practice in the heights of Colorado Springs in order to condition them for the hypoxemia that&rsquo;ll hit them as the game wears on.</p>

<p>On top of that, the Chargers taking more than three points makes them all the more tempting.</p>
