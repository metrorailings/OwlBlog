			<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Eli Manning, Daniel Jones</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Sterling Shepard (WR), Saquon Barkley (RB), Golden Tate (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Evan Engram (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Janoris Jenkins (CB), Michael Thomas (FS), Jabrill Peppers (SS), Dalvin Tomlinson (DT)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Dave Gettleman (GM), Pat Shurmur (HC), Mike Shula (OC), James Bettcher (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>The Giants have kept their whole offensive coaching staff from last year.</p>

<p>On defense, only about half the coaches have been retained. The assistant linebackers coach and the two defensive backs coaches have been replaced this year, likely in an attempt to improve the lagging passing defense in a league predisposed to airing the ball out.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’ll actually be interesting to see how the Giants do this year. Despite Dave Gettleman’s criminal mismanagement of this organization, the roster still features some considerable talent. Pat Shurmur has kept many of his coaches from last year too, so nothing much changes from a schematic standpoint - players should have an easier time settling into their groove this year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Giants have a major problem at quarterback - Eli Manning. The man is a danger to this team. His unwillingness to throw the ball any further than ten yards severely limits the team’s potential on offense. And in today’s NFL, a team that cannot effectively air the ball out is doomed to failure. Listen, I love Eli and I’ll always cherish him for bringing two Super Bowl rings to the team. 2011 was the year I fell in love with football, and it was all because Eli single-handedly dragged these Giants to the championship that season. It was a season that forever cemented his legacy as a Giant great. But all great men fall victim to father time sooner or later - Manning is no different. His era has passed. It’s time for Daniel Jones to succeed him as the franchise quarterback.</p>

<p>That being said, it’ll take time for Jones to adjust to life in the NFL. Rookie quarterbacks almost never see immediate success their first year in the league. And according to the experts, Jones is still rough around the edges coming out of college - if so, then expect the man to take a year or two making quite a few mistakes as he hones his talents.</p>

<p>It also doesn’t help that the team is absolutely gutless at the pass rush. After dealing Olivier Vernon to the Browns, Gettleman has left this team completely bare along the edges of the defensive line. The hope here is that Lorenzo Carter and Markus Golden can serviceably fill in that void, what with the former having a full year of experience under his belt and the latter having thrived before under James Bettcher back when Bettcher was the defensive coordinator for the Cardinals. But we’ll need to wait and see whether this plan pans out.</p>

<p>You know what though&hellip;if there is one good thing to be said about New York’s defensive front, it’s that the Giants are fielding some big bodies along the trenches. B.J. Hill, Dalvin Tomlinson, and Dexter Lawrence lend some serious size to that defensive line, and that’ll be key at stopping opposing rushers from running buck wild up the middle.</p>

<p>The Giants are still rebuilding. That defense will need roughly two to three years to regain top form now that most of their major players from recent years past have been shipped out or unsigned. And that’s fine, as Daniel Jones will need a few seasons to sharpen his skills as a passer. It’s possible the team could pull as many as six wins this season, but expect nothing more than that.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-4"><strong><em>Tier 4</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Dak Prescott</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Ezekiel Elliott (RB), Amari Cooper (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Dak Prescott (Mobile QB), Randall Cobb (WR), Jason Witten (TE), Dak Prescott (Mobile QB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Demarcus Lawrence (DE), Robert Quinn (DE), Leighton Vander Esch (OLB), Jaylon Smith (MLB), Byron Jones (CB), Chidobe Awuzie (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Jerry Jones (GM), Jason Garrett (HC), Kellen Moore (New OC), Rod Marinelli (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, quarterbacks coach Kellen Moore was promoted this year to offensive coordinator, replacing the beleaguered Scott Linehan. Jon Kitna will take over his former position on the coaching staff.</p>

<p>On defense, nothing has changed from last year.</p>

<hr />

<p>I feel silly billing this team as Super Bowl contenders last year. Even though the Cowboys won the division and clawed their way to the division round in the postseason, it wasn’t an inspiring season to say the least. The Cowboys notched too many wins by slim margins last year - take away the game against Jacksonville and Dallas’ point differential for the season dips into the negatives.</p>

<p>A few good things have been done during the offseason. In an effort to turn around an offense that was stagnant for much of the season, the team wisely let Scott Linehan go. Kellen Moore has been promoted in his stead. And promisingly enough, Moore seems more willing to try new things this year, even giving lip service to this idea of letting Dak run around with the ball at times. It was a tactic that was glaringly missing from Linehan’s playbook last year. Still, I do have my doubts about whether Moore <em>is actually allowed</em> to unleash Dak if necessary - I’m not sure if Jason Garrett or Jerry Jones are able to tolerate the risk of Dak sustaining injury as he’s running around the field. Many folks were calling for more scramble plays last year too, but the Cowboys insisted on keeping Dak situated in the pocket.</p>

<p>And really, that leads me to the major issue at hand here - I question Jason Garrett as a head coach. Hell, I even question Jerry Jones as a general manager. Before the regular season even started last year, it was a known fact that the Cowboys were deficient on quality receivers. I thought the team’s brain trust was well aware of the issue and would find a fix early into the season. Instead, it took an expensive trade for Amari Cooper late into November to jump-start the air game. And Cooper, as talented as he may be, is only one man. Coming into this season, this team still hasn’t done much to alleviate their receiver concerns. Randall Cobb was brought into the ranks over from Green Bay, but I honestly see this as more a lateral move given Cole Beasley’s departure over the offseason. The only upward move may have been resigning the aging Jason Witten, though doubts linger about whether he can perform even passably after taking a year off from the game. On top of that, Sanjay Lal still remains the team’s wide receivers coach, despite overseeing a unit that fell far short of its potential last year.</p>

<p>But while question marks still persist on offense and coaching, the defense looks to be solid yet again this year. Consistency in personnel and coaching this year should help the defense settle back quicker into its groove this year. And even though that defensive front only has one elite talent in its ranks, Rod Marinelli seems to find ways to have that defensive line outperform the sum of its individual parts. More importantly, the back seven remains as strong as ever, headlined by the linebacking duo of Leighton Vander Esch and Jaylon Smith. It’s these two that set the tone for the rest of their comrades. Barring multiple injuries to key players, the defense should once again carry this team to a few wins.</p>

<p>So where do I stand here? I see the Cowboys as a middling team that could break into the postseason once more, depending on luck and whether Kellen Moore is allowed to weave more creativity into the offensive playbook. Or maybe it all depends on how hard Jason Garrett will be clapping when his team needs him the most&hellip;</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Preseason Review - Philadelphia Eagles</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<h2 id="tier-1"><strong><em>Tier 1</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Carson Wentz</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Zach Ertz (TE), Alshon Jeffery (WR), DeSean Jackson (WR), Miles Sanders (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Carson Wentz (Mobile QB), Jordan Howard (RB), Nelson Agholor (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Brandon Graham (DE), Fletcher Cox (DT), Malik Jackson (DT), Zach Brown (OLB), Ronald Darby (CB), Malcolm Jenkins (SS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Howie Roseman (GM), Doug Pederson (HC), Mike Groh (OC), Jim Schwartz (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Win Total:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>The Eagles last season had an odd coaching set-up on both sides of the ball, in that every major position group has at least two coaches overseeing them. Still, for the most part, the major offensive coaches from last year were retained this year, with the exception of the wide receivers coach.</p>

<p>On defense, only the defensive line coach has been replaced from last year, with Phillip Daniels now heading that group. It’s worth noting that former Dolphins defensive coordinator Matt Burke has now been brought on as an advisor to the defensive staff.</p>

<hr />

<p>The injury bug and the Super Bowl hangover depressed this team’s potential last year. It’s possible that Frank Reich’s departure also left a bit of a hole on offense that Mike Groh couldn’t quite patch up in his first year as the Eagles offensive coordinator. Even still, Philadelphia managed to fight their way to the division round of the playoffs before bowing out for the season.</p>

<p>Once again, Philly is stacked with talent. Not all the names listed above will be able to contribute significantly, but so long as some of those players live up to their billing and Wentz remains healthy, this team will be just fine. Speaking of which&hellip;.without Nick Foles backing him up, Carson Wentz is critical to the team’s success this season. Signs are there that the fourth-year quarterback will come through however. Last year, analytical outfits concluded that (despite not having any gaudy numbers) Wentz was actually better than he was the year before in what may be considered his <em>annus mirabilis</em> - his quarterbacking fundamentals and decision-making was so much more solid. Wentz should continue to be able to play at a high level.</p>

<p>One last point worth bringing up is the state of that defensive line, given that it is the heart and soul of this defense. And it thrives so long as snap counts for the linemen are carefully managed and star players are allowed to play at different positions along the line. And despite trading away Michael Bennett in the offseason, the Eagles still have four promising players lining up in the trenches. This should be one of the best defensive lines in the league this year, especially as that defensive backfield has the talent and wits to cover skill players long enough for the pass rush to hit home.</p>

<p>Given how weak the division looks, I expect a good year for Philadelphia. The Eagles should be able to break into double-digit win territory.</p>

	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Derek Carr</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Jalen Richard (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Tyrell Williams (WR), Josh Jacobs (RB), Doug Martin (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Clelin Ferrell (DE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Mike Mayock (New GM), Jon Gruden (HC), Greg Olson (OC), Paul Guenther (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Aside from the running backs coach, the offensive coaching staff has been kept intact from last year. It&rsquo;s worth noting that this team has opted to keep Tom Cable around as the offensive line coach, despite his track record of failure. So not much is to be expected from the offensive line this year, putting even more pressure on an easily frightened Derek Carr.</p>

<p>On defense, we see a bit of reorganization. The defensive line coach from last year is now a senior assistant on the defensive staff. A new coach was hired to take on oversight duties over the defensive line. On a similar note, the senior assistant from last year will now be training the defensive backs exclusively - the old coach that managed the secondary has been sent packing.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once again, I was wrong last year. I truly believed Gruden would work his magic and turn the Raiders into a decent team. Instead, the man literally traded away two of his best players, leaving the roster truly bereft of any real talent outside of Jared Cook, who took his talents to an actual contender this year. Too many holes on the roster and a lack of identity led the Raiders to only four wins last year.</p>

<p>Before delving into the negatives, let’s start off on a positive note. Oakland did score a victory in the offseason by scooping Antonio Brown away from the Steelers in what literally was more a fire sale than an equitable trade. Despite his diva-like ways, Antonio Brown will be fundamentally critical to any success the Raiders see on offense. With Brown lining up for the offense, the Raiders can actually threaten opposing defenses, forcing them to commit too many resources to one player and thereby opening up opportunities for the other skill players running routes. Should Gruden be able to scheme well and Derek Carr be able to execute consistently enough, we could see some great performances this year from the likes of Tyrell Williams and Jalen Richard.</p>

<p>But those are big ifs that largely hinge on Gruden and his coaching ability. It’s funny that I write this just as Gruden has gone on record to state a growing affection for <em>Nathan Peterman,</em> of all players. The same Nathan Peterman that notoriously threw five interceptions in his first start ever in the NFL and has failed to redeem himself ever since. The same Nathan Peterman some claim to be the worst quarterback to ever start an NFL game. What does this say about Gruden and his grasp on reality? Maybe Gruden sees something in him I don’t? Then again&hellip;maybe it’s simpler than that - the man just doesn’t have an eye for talent. After all, shipping out proven players in Khalil Mack and Amari Cooper for draft picks were idiotic moves. And in fact, those moves look all the more foolish when you consider Oakland’s first draft pick this year was an overreach, according to some reputable analysts. Allegedly, the Raiders could have flipped the fourth pick for more draft value and still have ended up with the man they would have drafted anyway at that spot.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, their draft board emphasized men of character above most other factors. It’s a preference that I honestly find peculiar - this team went out of its way in the offseason to sign Vontaze Burfict and Richie Incognito, both players known for being dysfunctional jackasses. The latter has already been suspended two games this year for unprofessional conduct. So this whole idea of mixing impressionable rookies with veterans prone to reckless behavior doesn’t sound right to me. Once again, strange marriages like this hinge on Jon Gruden’s ability to lead, but his failure as a schemer and talent evaluator last year has me wary of his overall competence as a coach. Put simply, I’ve lost faith in Gruden.</p>

<p>But at the very least, the Raiders do have a better roster this year compared to last year’s. Even the defense is a slight step up, though not much has been done from a personnel standpoint in the offseason. The hope here is that the defensive players drafted last year are able to mesh into a functional defense this year, given all the action they’ve seen in their rookie seasons. It would also help if some of the defensive rookies drafted this year are able to contribute as well. So there’s a remote possibility that this defense may actually be serviceable.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>After an offseason full of needless drama, Antonio Brown is gone. The team released him after Brown publicly expressed a desire to leave the team. Honestly, it was a good move given the circumstances. Unfortunately, this also puts the kibosh on the Raiders season. I had to downgrade them to the very last tier. Oakland&rsquo;s offense will be incredibly pedestrian this year.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-1"><strong><em>Tier 1</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Patrick Mahomes</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Tyreek Hill (WR), Travis Kelce (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Sammy Watkins (WR), Carlos Hyde (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Chris Jones (DT), Frank Clark (DE), Tyrann Mathieu (FS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Brett Veach (GM), Andy Reid (HC), Eric Bieniemy (OC), Steve Spagnuolo (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 10.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, absolutely nothing has changed. A rarity in a league where assistant coaches typically travel around different teams every year or two.</p>

<p>On defense, however, the powers that be threw Bob Sutton and most of his staff out the door after a season in which his defense ranked among the worst in the league. Which is pretty odd considering the team featured an incredible set of pass rushers last year. Anyway, Steve Spagnuolo now steps in as the defensive coordinator, bringing with him a whole bunch of new coaches to join the three assistants that were kept from Sutton’s administration. It’s worth noting that of those three that managed to survive from last year, only one has a major role this year, as the outside linebackers coach.</p>

<hr />

<p>Much to my surprise, not only was Patrick Mahomes ready for the professional leagues, but the kid went and won himself the coveted MVP award last year. Despite his youth, Mahomes is clearly a top-tier quarterback. Even though he’s bound to regress this year, I have little doubt that he’ll continue playing at an elite level.</p>

<p>Also worth noting is the sudden emergence of that pass rush. Before the 2018 season, I thought Justin Houston was the only pass rusher worthy of mention on this Chiefs roster. But last season, Dee Ford and Chris Jones took their game to the next level and staked their names as premiere pass rushers - Justin Houston ended up being only the third best player on the defense at pressuring opposing quarterbacks. Curiously enough though, the team released Houston and traded Dee Ford during the offseason. On a surface level, one would wonder why the team’s personnel managers would cut loose two of their three best pass rushers last season? But Justin Houston began showing his age last season and Ford only managed to play well last year. It’s no guarantee the latter can continue performing well, especially during a non-contract year. Instead, Kansas opted to spend some cash and draft capital to prune Frank Clark away from the Seahawks. Not a bad move in my estimation, considering Clark has been reliable and steadily improving year-over-year. Honestly, I don’t expect too much of a drop-off this year for the pass rush, especially if sophomore player Breeland Speaks starts flashing here and there.</p>

<p>A quick glance tells me this team doesn’t have too many holes. That patchwork defense from last year shouldn’t be as awful this year so long as Spags can work his magic here. Luckily, the law of averages will be working in his favor - terrible defenses (much like sensational players) tend to regress toward the mean the next year. So it’s likely this Chiefs defense will end up being serviceable, especially if Frank Clark and Chris Jones can keep the pass rush humming this year.</p>

<p>But now here’s the problem with the Chiefs - despite Andy Reid’s tendency to dominate during the regular season, the man finds ways to fall apart during the postseason. His playoff record is riddled with failures and dashed hopes. How could such a great regular season coach fail repeatedly in the postseason? Honestly, there’s no clear answer here, though judging by their conference title game last year, two things in particular seem to stick out - bad clock management and an unwillingness to change things up on offense from time to time. The latter is particularly damning - knowing that Mahomes and Reid love their big pass plays, the Patriots drafted a fantastic defensive plan that effectively silenced Kansas City’s offense for the first half. Sadly, Reid never really properly adjusted during the course of the game, stubbornly insisting on running many of the same plays that carried the Chiefs through the regular season. The problem here is that once opposing coaches successfully decipher your style of offense, your team is left hamstrung if it’s not able to adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>Honestly though, stubborn offensive coaches can be saved by great defenses bailing them out of bad situations time and time again. But the Chiefs were truly abysmal last year on defense - it’ll take at least a few years for this defensive corps to climb to a level high enough to make up for the mistakes Andy Reid inevitably makes in his postseason appearances. Until then, Kansas City will need to be content with another postseason berth that again ends just short of a Super Bowl.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-2"><strong><em>Tier 2</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Philip Rivers</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Keenan Allen (WR), Melvin Gordon (RB), Hunter Henry (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Travis Benjamin (WR), Dontrelle Inman (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Joey Bosa (DE), Melvin Ingram (DE), Thomas Davis (LB), Casey Hayward (CB), Derwin James (SS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Tom Telesco (GM), Anthony Lynn (HC), Ken Whisenhunt (OC), Gus Bradley (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Remarkably, the coaching staff from last year has been almost wholly retained this season. The only major departure from last year is the assistant defensive line coach, who left to join the Rams as their primary defensive line coach.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Chargers impressed last year, traveling all the way to the division round of the playoffs before bowing out for the season.</p>

<p>All signs would indicate this team is bound to repeat as postseason contenders. Still, I’m not all too comfortable listing them as prospective champions just yet. Rivers has one less weapon this year now that Tyrell Williams skipped town to join the Raiders. Then again, if Dontrelle Inman shows some positive flashes here, Tyrell might not be missed so much.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s the coaching that bothers me. Although to be honest, the coaches stunned me last year by putting together a brilliant game plan against the Ravens in the playoffs. Having faced them once before during the regular season, Los Angeles reviewed the game tape and noticed the Ravens offensive players would show their hand before the ball was even snapped. Essentially, by watching the way the offensive linemen positioned themselves along the line of scrimmage, the Charger defenders knew whether the play was a run play or pass play. Furthermore, the Chargers fielded up to seven defensive backs on the field as part of a concerted effort to limit Lamar Jackson any time he scrambles.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these same coaches were clowned the week after when they ran the same strategy against New England. The Patriots tore apart their dime and quarter defensive packages by rushing the football downfield - after all, lighter bodies have a harder time stopping the run. The Chargers never really adjusted until it was way too late.</p>

<p>Will Anthony Lynn, Ken Whisenhunt, and Gus Bradley be able to step their game up this year? Not too sure. And the offseason doesn’t give me too much to make a sound judgement. One thing worth noting is the high number of pass attempts under which Rivers was in duress last season. It seems the Chargers haven’t done much in the offseason to address that shoddy offensive line, from a personnel or coaching perspective. So if that’s an indication of what to expect this season, things don’t look too great for the Chargers. A playoff appearance is likely, but the conference championships (let alone the Super Bowl) may still be out of reach.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-3">Tier 3</h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Joe Flacco, Drew Lock</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Emmanuel Sanders (WR), Phillip Lindsay (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Courtland Sutton (WR), Noah Fant (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Von Miller (DE), Bradley Chubb (DE), Chris Harris Jr. (CB), Bryce Callahan (CB), Derek Wolfe (DT)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>John Elway (GM), Vic Fangio (New HC), Rich Scangarello (New OC), Ed Donatell (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 7</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, only the running backs coach and the wide receivers coach from last year managed to survive the transition from the short-lived Vance Joseph era to the Vic Fangio regime.</p>

<p>Similarly on defense, only the defensive line coach and linebackers coach survived the coaching overhaul. Everybody else has been replaced or had their roles outright eliminated or revised into another role.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Broncos are experimenting yet again with another quarterback this season in Joe Flacco. Unfortunately, Flacco’s better days are far behind him. Joe Cool hasn’t had a successful season for a while. Maybe if Gary Kubiak was still around, Flacco would have a shot at being serviceable. But Kubiak isn’t there and Flacco isn’t likely to experience a resurgence in Denver anyway. Very few quarterbacks, if any at all, see a second wind at this point in their careers. John Elway did draft a quarterback prospect in Drew Lock this year, but it’ll take at least several weeks for Lock to return from an injury on his throwing hand. Honestly though, given Elway’s history picking and signing quarterbacks over the last couple years, I wouldn’t be holding out much hope here for the young rookie.</p>

<p>It’s not all that awful for the Broncos though. The team still has one of the best pass-rushing duos in the league in Von Miller and Bradley Chubb. They still feature a quality ground game headlined by Phillip Lindsay. They still boast the best home-field advantage in the league. And perhaps best of all, they actually have a manageable schedule this year.</p>

<p>We haven’t even addressed the coaching changes yet. Standing on the sidelines will be rookie head coach Vic Fangio, who has had a sensational career in the NFL as a defensive coach. While I can’t speak much about any of his coordinators or position coaches, Fangio’s reputation as a defensive mastermind gives me hope for the new coaching regime here. At the very least, the new coaches should be able to transform a defensive unit that underwhelmed last year.</p>

<p>Despite their quarterback situation, the Broncos have so many positive aspects about them that I project that this team will eke its way into the playoffs as a wild-card contender.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Nick Foles</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Keelan Cole (WR), Marqise Lee (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Leonard Fournette (RB), Dede Westbrook (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Calais Campbell (E), Yannick Ngakoue (E), Marcel Dareus (DT), Josh Allen (OLB), Myles Jack (MLB), Telvin Smith (OLB), Jalen Ramsey (CB), A.J. Bouye (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Tom Coughlin (Exec), David Caldwell (GM), Doug Marrone (HC), John DeFillippo (New OC), Todd Wash (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 7.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On the offensive side, quite a few of the assistant coaches from last year were retained, despite the hiring of a new offensive coordinator in John DeFillippo. Only offensive line coach Pat Flaherty and running backs coach Tyrone Wheatley were let go. While I don’t have much of an opinion on the latter, I can say that firing Pat Flaherty is likely a good move. Flaherty has been lousy at training up offensive linemen since his days with the New York Giants. Jacksonville’s ragged offensive line last year is yet another blemish on his resume.</p>

<p>On the defensive side, Perry Fewell was released from his duties overseeing the secondary in favor of a two-man coaching set-up. Furthermore, Dom Capers joins the staff as an advisor to Mark Wash.</p>

<p>How wrong and right I was last year…</p>

<p>I was (pretty obviously) right in that Blake Bortles could torpedo this team’s Super Bowl hopes. But I was devastatingly wrong as to how low the Jaguars would sink if the Bortles train were derailed. Once Bortles lost whatever little confidence he had following a humiliating performance in Arrowhead, the rest of the team collectively gave up on the season. The defensive backs soon lost their swagger while the defensive linemen lost their cool. The locker room environment quickly became toxic, as defensive players were fighting one another and some of the offensive players were stewing angrily over their quarterback situation.</p>

<p>Anyway, the powers that be in Jacksonville eventually reached a hard conclusion - that the promised land would always be out of reach so long as a simpleton like Bortles continued helming their offense. So Bortles was let go and a four-year contract was dealt out to Nick Foles to replace him. Any hopes of the Jaguars making the postseason rests on the shoulders of the former Super Bowl MVP.</p>

<p>So can the Jaguars fight their way back to respectability this season? Sure, they can. Will they though? A few variables stand in the way of a solid prediction here. The biggest variable is whether John DeFillippo and Nick Foles could gel together. While DeFillippo worked well with Foles two years ago during Philadelphia’s championship run, he was only a quarterbacks coach then. It still remains to be seen whether DeFillippo is able to coach a competent offense as a coordinator. His last stint in that same role ended with him getting fired mid-season. A firing that was made all the more curious given that the Vikings have one of the best coaching staffs in the league.</p>

<p>Another major variable is whether Doug Marrone and Tom Coughlin can reinstill a sense of discipline in a team that lost its religion last year. And signs seem to indicate that the two men are doing a fine job so far at wrangling this team’s chaotic impulses. Nothing best exemplifies this then the way the team handled the contract situations for Myles Jack and Yannick Ngakoue. One of those two men actually showed up to all team activities and participated without complaining about ongoing contract negotiations. The other man did the opposite, protesting his contract situation by refusing to participate in any preseason team activities. The Jaguars management did the right thing and rewarded the team player while stalling contract talks with the player holding out. Decisions like that go a long way to building a culture that prizes teamwork and unity, the exact two things the Jaguars were missing last year.</p>

<p>Given that the Colts no longer have a franchise quarterback and the Texans are making stupid decisions in pursuit of some superficial show of championship potential, the Jaguars have a very real chance of winning this division outright. Much of that will depend on whether Foles can flourish under DeFillippo. So here’s hoping that DeFillippo can go back to his days in Philadelphia and find plays that bring the best out of his quarterback.</p>
