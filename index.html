	<div class='postTitle'>Pass Rush Comparison: Chiefs vs. 49ers</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Given two weeks to strategize and the guarantee that both teams in the Super Bowl will be performing at their absolute best, the championship game usually comes down to whoever manages to punch the other in the mouth more. So in this regard, it&rsquo;s the pass rush then that&rsquo;s arguably the most important factor here - after all, the only way to truly stymie a passing game in these circumstances is to attack the sole player responsible for marshaling the offense in the air game - the quarterback.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s evaluate how the two teams perform against one another by comparing their performances against common opponents. When it comes to the 49ers and Chiefs, both teams have two opponents in common - the Packers and the Ravens. Let&rsquo;s start off with the Packers first.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="packers-chiefs-week-8">Packers @ Chiefs (Week 8)</h3>

<p><em>Hurries:</em> <strong>6</strong></p>

<p><em>Hits:</em> <strong>8</strong></p>

<p><em>Sacks:</em> <strong>4</strong></p>

<p><em>Eligible Passes Attempted:</em> <strong>35</strong></p>

<p>Impressive showing from the Chiefs here. While no one defensive lineman really stood out, Kansas City was able to hit home on multiple occasions thanks in large part to their blitzing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting neither Chris Jones nor Frank Clark were able to play in this game.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="packers-49ers-week-12">Packers @ 49ers (Week 12)</h3>

<p><em>Hurries:</em> <strong>11</strong></p>

<p><em>Hits:</em> <strong>3</strong></p>

<p><em>Sacks:</em> <strong>6</strong></p>

<p><em>Eligible Passes Attempted:</em> <strong>38</strong></p>

<p>The raw numbers are a lot less impressive than I initially thought - the 49ers only managed to post up 9 hits on Rodgers. Still, what&rsquo;s key is that it seemed like San Francisco had Rodgers on his heels the whole game. Despite his tendency to hold the ball and dance in the pocket, Aaron seemed all too content settling for short passes.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="vikings-chiefs-week-9">Vikings @ Chiefs (Week 9)</h3>

<p><em>Hurries:</em> <strong>13</strong></p>

<p><em>Hits:</em> <strong>5</strong></p>

<p><em>Sacks:</em> <strong>1</strong></p>

<p><em>Eligible Passes Attempted:</em> <strong>41</strong></p>

<p>Chris Jones established his reputation as the best pass rusher on this team, racking up a sack, a few hits, and a few hurries. Other than that, the Chiefs did a fairly good job applying heat to Cousins.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="vikings-49ers-division-round">Vikings @ 49ers (Division Round)</h3>

<p><em>Hurries:</em> <strong>6</strong></p>

<p><em>Hits:</em> <strong>4</strong></p>

<p><em>Sacks:</em> <strong>4</strong></p>

<p><em>Eligible Passes Attempted:</em> <strong>25</strong></p>

			<p>The 49ers may have the best set of linebackers in the league when it comes to pass coverage. Two attempts by the Packers to run routes out from the backfield ended up falling short thanks to the speed of these linebackers, led by Kwan Alexander.</p>

<p>The Packers refusal to stack the box more against the run is hurting them. Their defensive line is simply unable to hold steady against the ground attack. And unfortunately, that leaves mostly defensive backs to guard against the run once their first line of defense fails.</p>

<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s defensive line is winning its battles in the trenches consistently.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>AFC Conference Championship - Titans @ Chiefs</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Bad start by the Chiefs - a three and out. A 2nd down sack by Correa set the Chiefs back a little too far. Titans looking more impressive so far.</p>

<p>The Chiefs offense is struggling. Sometimes due to drops, but other times due to the Titans playing aggressively in their pass coverage and winning their battles at the line of scrimmage. The Titans have been getting pressure on Mahomes, strangely enough. Not sure how or why. Either way, this is markedly different from the situation last week against the Texans. The Texans weren&rsquo;t winning any of their battles collectively as a defensive unit. The Titans are seeing more success though.</p>

<p>Brilliant adjustment by the Chiefs in the second half. The Titans are dedicating too many of their resources to stopping the big passing attack. As a result, the Chiefs have been making hay with rushes, quarterback scrambles, and short passes. The Titans have been powerless to stop these plays.</p>

<p>Despite the big win, the Chiefs made a number of silly mistakes here. Notably silly mistakes by their defense that awarded free yards to the Titans and an incredibly dumb oversight on special teams when it was somewhat obvious the Titans would be running a fake punt. Andy Reid may be a great offensive mind, but his attention to other details and his commitment to discipline is a little questionable.</p>

			<p>Given that the Packers will be visiting San Francisco yet again to contend against the 49ers for the NFC crown, let&rsquo;s see if we can collect some useful insights from the first match that will inform our bets for the rematch.</p>

<hr />

<p>The 49ers defensive line is manhandling this Packers offensive line. Nick Bosa, DJ Jones, Arik Armstead, and DeForest Buckner are all doing well so far to start the game.</p>

<p>Two bad penalties against the Packers have set back their momentum.</p>

<p>Horrible call on a 4th and 1 by Matt LaFleur. Just sad. A run up the middle. Nothing more than that.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen enough. I question whether the Packers are capable of playing drop-back football. At the same time, I wonder the same thing about these 49ers. I&rsquo;ll need to watch a game where the opposing team kept them on their heels to see if Jimmy G is capable of marshaling this offense outside of scheme.</p>

			<p>The Chiefs and Titans faced each other once before in the regular season. Let&rsquo;s just watch that match and see if we can pick up some detailed insights that would inform us in their playoff rematch.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Titans are taking advantage of Kansas City&rsquo;s single-high coverage, nailing a big throw off play-action that ultimately led to a touchdown a few minutes later. Kansas City can negate this by emulating the Patriots strategy and keeping two safeties deep, therefore encouraging the Titans into running the ball more and passing to receivers running intermediate routes.</p>

<p>Tennessee&rsquo;s defensive backs are not pressing enough against the Chiefs skill players. But then again&hellip;it&rsquo;s a risky proposition considering a failed press can lead to a score for this Chiefs offense.</p>

<p>The Titans have been big beneficiaries of luck in this game. Not only has Kansas been hit unfairly with penalties that ended a potential touchdown drive, but the Chiefs have been ravaged by injuries to their offensive front in the first half. Also worth mentioning is Frank Clark dropping a gift of an interception.</p>

<p>I wonder if Carrente is more inclined to calling penalties against road teams. If so, that doesn&rsquo;t bode well for the Titans.</p>

<p>So as it turns out, Carrente is more prone to favoring home teams in terms of penalties. Only two other referees this season have shown more favorability towards the host teams. Good news for the Chiefs.</p>

<p>Tennessee defense masking its coverage scheme while Kansas City continues using layers of misdirection to move the ball down the field. So far, the Chiefs are winning this battle.</p>

<p>Kansas City pass coverage has stifled the Titans passing attack here outside of one play. Their run defense is horrible, but at least the Chiefs can afford to put an extra man in the box and play man coverage against the Titans skill players.</p>

<p>Even against seven-man boxes, Derrick Henry is still chewing off huge chunks of yardage. The Chiefs are going to have a hard time keeping Henry from popping off.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Analyzing Conference Rematches in the Postseason</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Something dawned on me now that the conference finals this year will be rematches between teams that faced each other once before earlier in the year. Do teams that lose the first match have an advantage in the playoff rematch?</p>

<p>To find out, let&rsquo;s analyze data going back to 2009.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2009">2009</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Colts (17)</strong> @ Ravens (15)</li>
<li>Colts (15) @ <strong>Jets (29)</strong></li>
<li>Ravens (21) @ <strong>Patriots (27)</strong></li>
<li>Bengals (0) @ <strong>Jets (37)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Packers (33)</strong> @ Cardinals (7)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Ravens (3) @ <strong>Colts (20)</strong></li>
<li>Jets (17) @ <strong>Colts (30)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ravens (33)</strong> @ Patriots (14)</li>
<li><strong>Jets (24)</strong> @ Bengals (14)</li>
<li>Packers (45) @ <strong>Cardinals (51)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 3 matches and different results in 3 matches. Some games here have circumstances worth mentioning - in the Colts loss to the Jets, Peyton Manning was pulled early for some strange reason. Apparently, Jim Caldwell didn&rsquo;t care much about maintaining an undefeated record through the season. The Jets-Bengals games were literally back-to-back, as their regular season encounter took place on the last week of the season. Oddly enough, the Cowboys and the Eagles were in a similar situation, playing each other on the last week of the season only to have to play each other again in the Wild Card round. The games played out the same way both ways - the Cowboys were able to win in domineering fashion. It makes me wonder whether the second meeting between two teams meeting one another on consecutive weeks favors the winner of the first meeting.</p>

<p>Once again, we have another incidence here of teams meeting one another on back-to-back meetings - the Packers and the Cardinals. However, the Cardinals trotted out their back-up quarterback in the first match, so the rematch was a little different. Aaron Rodgers and his crew were able to rack up more points in the rematch though.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2010">2010</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Packers (27)</strong> @ Eagles (20)</li>
<li>Packers (17) @ <strong>Falcons (20)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Jets (22)</strong> @ Steelers (17)</li>
<li>Seahawks (19) @ <strong>Saints (34)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Seahawks (23)</strong> @ Bears (20)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Packers (21)</strong> @ Eagles (16)</li>
<li><strong>Packers (48)</strong> @ Falcons (21)</li>
<li>Jets (19) @ <strong>Steelers (24)</strong></li>
<li>Saints (36) @ <strong>Seahawks (41)</strong></li>
<li>Seahawks (24) @ <strong>Bears (35)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 1 match and different results in 4 matches. Once again, a caveat here worth noting for the one set of games with the same results. The first match between the Packers and the Eagles took place on the first week of the season, so I&rsquo;m not too sure whether that game can be justifiably linked to its playoff counterpart given that the first week of the season tends to be a bit wild.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2011">2011</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Packers (38)</strong> @ Giants (35)</li>
<li>Giants (20) @ <strong>49ers (27)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Patriots (41)</strong> @ Broncos (23)</li>
<li>Lions (17) @ <strong>Saints (31)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Texans (20)</strong> @ Bengals (19)</li>
<li>Texans (14) @ <strong>Ravens (29)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Giants (37)</strong> @ Packers (20)</li>
<li><strong>Giants (20)</strong> @ 49ers (17)</li>
<li>Broncos (10) @ <strong>Patriots (45)</strong></li>
<li>Lions (28) @ <strong>Saints (45)</strong></li>
<li>Bengals (10) @ <strong>Texans (31)</strong></li>
<li>Texans (13) @ <strong>Ravens (20)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 4 matches and different results in 2 matches. Not much to caveat here, though it is worth noting the Texans were forced to go down their quarterback depth chart in the rematch against the Bengals. Not that it mattered much though, as Houston was still able to pull out the win.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2012">2012</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Patriots (30) @ <strong>Ravens (31)</strong></li>
<li>Ravens (17) @ <strong>Broncos (34)</strong></li>
<li><strong>49ers (30)</strong> @ Packers (22)</li>
<li>Texans (14) @ <strong>Patriots (42)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ravens (28)</strong> @ Patriots (13)</li>
<li><strong>Ravens (38)</strong> @ Broncos (35)</li>
<li>Packers (31) @ <strong>49ers (45)</strong></li>
<li>Texans (28) @ <strong>Patriots (41)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 3 matches and a different result in 1 match.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that in the postseason rematch, all the losers in the first meeting did far better from a points perspective. Even the Packers, who were quite frankly lucky to have posted up 22 points against the 49ers in their first encounter.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2013">2013</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Saints (7) @ <strong>Seahawks (34)</strong></li>
<li>Broncos (31) @ <strong>Patriots (34)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Colts (23)</strong> @ Chiefs (7)</li>
<li><strong>Bengals (17)</strong> @ Chargers (10)</li>
<li>Packers (28) @ <strong>49ers (34)</strong></li>
<li>49ers (9) @ <strong>Panthers (10)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Saints (15) @ <strong>Seahawks (23)</strong></li>
<li>Patriots (16) @ <strong>Broncos (26)</strong></li>
<li>Chiefs (44) @ <strong>Colts (45)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chargers (27)</strong> @ Bengals (10)</li>
<li><strong>49ers (23)</strong> @ Packers (20)</li>
<li><strong>49ers (23)</strong> @ Panthers (10)</li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 3 matches and different results in 3 matches. It&rsquo;s worth noting the 49ers win against the Packers in the regular season came in the first week of the season. Nonetheless, I do see a theme here - the losers in the regular season performed better in the playoff rematch.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2014">2014</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Patriots (42)</strong> @ Colts (20)</li>
<li>Packers (16) @ <strong>Seahawks (36)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Seahawks (13)</strong> @ Panthers (9)</li>
<li>Bengals (0) @ <strong>Colts (27)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Colts (7) @ <strong>Patriots (45)</strong></li>
<li>Packers (22) @ <strong>Seahawks (28)</strong></li>
<li>Panthers (17) @ <strong>Seahawks (31)</strong></li>
<li>Bengals (10) @ <strong>Colts (26)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in all 4 conference rematches. Little disappointing to say the least. Looks like this theory is on its way to being shot down.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2015">2015</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Broncos (27) @ <strong>Steelers (34)</strong></li>
<li>Patriots (24) @ <strong>Broncos (30)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Panthers (27)</strong> @ Seahawks (23)</li>
<li><strong>Seahawks (38)</strong> @ Vikings (7)</li>
<li>Packers (8) @ <strong>Cardinals (38)</strong></li>
<li>Texans (20) @ <strong>Chiefs (27)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Steelers (16) @ <strong>Broncos (23)</strong></li>
<li>Patriots (18) @ <strong>Broncos (20)</strong></li>
<li>Seahawks (24) @ <strong>Panthers (31)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Seahawks (10)</strong> @ Vikings (9)</li>
<li>Packers (20) @ <strong>Cardinals (26)</strong></li>
<li>Texans (0) @ <strong>Chiefs (30)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 5 matches and a different result in 1 match. It&rsquo;s worth noting both of Denver&rsquo;s rematches involved a different starting quarterback. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the Patriots would have likely won the first match had the injury gods not dealt them a major blow midway through the game.</p>

<p>Also, the Vikings were <em>so close</em> to upsetting the Seahawks in their playoff rematch. Still, the fact that they slashed the point deficit down 31 points is testament to this idea that losers from the first match tend to fare better in the rematch. Same with the Packers nearly stealing the win from the Cardinals despite fielding a depleted receiver corps. Only the Texans disappoint here, faring so much worse against the Chiefs in the postseason despite losing against them earlier in the season. It does make sense though, given Bill O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s well-documented history of failure.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2018">2018</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Cowboys (13) @ <strong>Seahawks (24)</strong></li>
<li>Eagles (7) @ <strong>Saints (48)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ravens (22)</strong> @ Chargers (10)</li>
<li>Chiefs (40) @ <strong>Patriots (43)</strong></li>
<li>Rams (35) @ <strong>Saints (45)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Seahawks (22) @ <strong>Cowboys (24)</strong></li>
<li>Eagles (14) @ <strong>Saints (20)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chargers (23)</strong> @ Ravens (17)</li>
<li><strong>Patriots (37)</strong> @ Chiefs (31)</li>
<li><strong>Rams (26)</strong> @ Saints (23)</li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 2 matches and different results in 3 matches.</p>

<p>The Eagles faced off against the Saints with a different quarterback leading them in the playoffs. Philadelphia fared much better in that rematch, one score away from taking the win, though the caveat here is that Drew Brees was clearly injured and not the same in the postseason compared to the regular season.</p>

<p>And on that same note, the Rams winning the rematch against the Saints is somewhat tainted by the fact that Brees is clearly off now that time is catching up to him.</p>

<hr />

<p>Data seems to accept this idea that losers in conference games during the regular season are more likely to win in the postseason, simply going by score differentials.</p>

			<h2 id="vikings-49ers">Vikings @ 49ers</h2>

<p>I need to examine the Vikings average depth of target here. I&rsquo;m not sure if they&rsquo;re attacking the flat enough here. Other than a big pass to Stefon Diggs, the Vikings passing game has been limp.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-ravens">Titans @ Ravens</h2>

<p>Somehow, the Titans are winning. They&rsquo;re playing mistake-free football. Meanwhile, Lamar is playing with rust and hubris. Why do I bet on huge postseason favorites? I&rsquo;ve already been burned last week by the Saints, now the Ravens are disappointing me.</p>

<p>Adoree Jackson is playing like a stud in the defense backfield for the Titans.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a real force at play here that&rsquo;s much more destructive than bad coaching or lack of resilience - it&rsquo;s apathy. The Ravens made so many uncharacteristic mistakes in this game, similar to the Saints of last week. Teams in the postseason are just as subject to apathy as are teams in the regular season.  It&rsquo;s just that the postseason is the <em>worst</em> possible time to try and wing your way through games. Every playoff team is considerably better than the lame teams that tend to be on the wrong end of large spreads in the regular season.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-chiefs">Texans @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Chiefs with the big plays dominating this game. The Chiefs came out a bit dry, but then ramped things up quickly and rode the momentum to a 50+ point beatdown.</p>

			<h2 id="vikings-49ers-7">Vikings @ 49ers (-7)</h2>

<p>Believe it or not, I love the Vikings in this spot. The 49ers have home field advantage, yes, but their lack of experience and mediocre defensive coaching should ice them against a resurgent Vikings team that found its groove last week.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bet: Vikings +7, Vikings ML, Cousins Passing Yards Over</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-ravens-9-5">Titans @ Ravens (-9.5)</h2>

<p>Yes, the Titans did well enough last week to upset the Patriots. But it took Vrabel&rsquo;s inside knowledge of Belichick and his tendencies to steal the road win. Vrabel and his coaching staff won&rsquo;t have that same luxury here against a Baltimore team that&rsquo;s so much better compared to New England.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bet: Ravens -9.5, Ravens ML</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-chiefs-9-5">Texans @ Chiefs (-9.5)</h2>

<p>Surprisingly, both teams are much more alike than one would think, especially if Will Fuller is able to play. Neither team is all that resilient mentally. Both teams have electric quarterbacks. Likewise, both teams have a similar number of weapons on offense and don&rsquo;t really impress all too much along their defensive front.</p>

<p>But the Chiefs have a much better defensive backfield, better offensive coaching, and the Arrowhead advantage here. Still, this spread is too wide for a Texans team that&rsquo;s better than what this spread implies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bet: Texans (+9.5), Chiefs ML</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="seahawks-packers-4-5">Seahawks @ Packers (-4.5)</h2>

<p>Honestly the hardest match to call this whole weekend. The Packers have too many question marks here, particular when it comes to coaching. This is Matt LaFleur&rsquo;s first real test as a head coach. Can LaFleur foster that fighting spirit in his team, that will to win that&rsquo;s so critical whenever a team finds itself in difficult circumstances? I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Seahawks aren&rsquo;t that good of a team, so it honestly shouldn&rsquo;t take much to defeat them. Seattle&rsquo;s coaching is pretty poor overall and their defense lacks any real talent.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bet: Packers ML</em></strong></p>
