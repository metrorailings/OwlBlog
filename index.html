			<h2 id="seahawks-browns">Seahawks @ Browns</h2>

<p>The Browns are just hot garbage, starting with Baker Mayfield.</p>

<p>To start, Baker threw two passes behind his receivers that ended up being picked. He also threw another interception early in the game that stunted some of the momentum the Browns built up out of the gate. Nick Chubb also fumbled the ball on another critical drive during the second half.</p>

<p>The coaching on a Browns drive that ended at the Seahawks goal line was atrocious. Freddie Kitchens made a series of bumbling moves on that drive, calling a fade pass on a 3rd down and then calling a bizarre-looking slant on 4th down. Despite the weird play on 4th down, Cleveland was bailed out  thanks to the Seattle defense committing a silly pre-snap penalty. But then Kitchens proceeded to throw the challenge flag as <em>his team ran their second 4th down play</em>. It was a challenge that ultimately failed, but then the Browns clumsily tried running the same play from before, only to be shut out from the end zone as the Seattle defense adjusted once Cleveland showed their hand earlier before.</p>

<p>The Seahawks were able to exert their will over the Browns defense, mostly on the ground. Chris Carson was a force, breaking tackles and churning out additional yards after contact. Cleveland needs to be more disciplined in their tackling. Some conditioning would also help as well.</p>

<p>Penalties were still an issue for this team, though a few of the penalties charged against the Browns looked a little spurious.</p>

<p>I have to stop picking bad teams unless those teams are taking more than 3 points.</p>

<p>Only thing worth praising for the Browns are their scripted play. It was those plays that led to Cleveland taking a double-digit lead halfway through the game.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="49ers-rams">49ers @ Rams</h2>

<p>I should be more wary of teams that can win in dominating fashion without much help from their quarterback. This Niners team is something special, even if Jimmy Garoppalo is off every now and then.</p>

<p>Man coverage isn&rsquo;t doing much against these 49ers. Kyle Shanahan is countering the Rams defensive coverage looks with bunch formations, from the few plays I did get a good look at.</p>

<p>The 49ers defense have hit their stride. Their aggressive man coverage and trench play is paying off in spades today.</p>

<p>Kyle Shanahan is pathologically conservative once he has a safe lead.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="eagles-vikings">Eagles @ Vikings</h2>

<p>The Vikings were able to make hay on the first drive through some end-around trickery and outside runs. Eagles defensive line also having a hard time pressuring Cousins on the drive.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing going in favor for the Eagles defense, it&rsquo;s that the front is holding up well against inside runs between the tackles.</p>

<p>Three straight runs for the Eagles offense, leading to a three-and-out on their first drive. The writing is on the wall, for fuck&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<p>Two drives - Cousins hasn&rsquo;t been all too impressive outside of one throw to Thielan down the middle of the field. Eagles having trouble getting pressure with their standard personnel however&hellip;which helps.</p>

<p>Jason Peters not playing left tackle may be a serious liability for the Eagles.</p>

<p>Outside runs are a serious problem for this Eagles front seven.</p>

<p>Finally, Kirk Cousins is discovering the deep ball again. Two home run balls to Stefon Diggs to put his Vikings up over 20 points. Main takeaway here is that Kirk Cousins has rediscovered his former penchant for the big play. Pretty similar to what I saw last year when the Vikings played Philadelphia at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>

<p>Eagles playing a good amount of zone defense.</p>

<p>Finally, Vikings are breaking out in the second half. Kirk Cousins making passes under pressure and the team finally using their two best skill players in creative and purposeful ways.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-chiefs">Texans @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Patrick Mahomes&rsquo; first pass was to Tyreek Hill.</p>

<p>Chiefs matriculated the ball pretty well on one drive. Using window dressing to make an inside run for a big gain, taking advantage of the amount of cushion the Texans are giving Tyreek Hill, and Mahomes even bringing back some of his magic with a lob to Travis Kelce under duress.</p>

<p>But the Texans returned the favor with a touchdown of their own. And that touchdown was more or less gotten through running the ball. The Chiefs are still unable to stop the run.</p>

<p>Bad deep ball from Patrick Mahomes resulting in his first interception of the season. It seems that ankle is more serious than was previously thought&hellip;he&rsquo;s not turning properly into his throws, though he does pass more like a baseball pitcher than an actual football quarterback anyway.</p>

<p>Just poor defense from the Chiefs. How do you let a halfback leak out run a wheel route out of the backfield without assigning anybody to him in coverage?</p>

<p>Tashuan Gipson is a weak point for the Texans secondary.</p>

<p>Chiefs&rsquo; pass rush is laughable.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="lions-packers">Lions @ Packers</h2>

<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t get the Lions. Start off with a flea flicker and a set of passes in order to throw the Packers off guard. Manage to post 13 points in the first 20 or so minutes of the game, but only 9 points the rest of the way, though.</p>

<p>Detroit&rsquo;s offense failed down the stretch. Their play-calling was uninspiring and predictable. Heavy formations almost always led to power run plays that the Packers were able to shut down fairly effectively. Spread formations usually led to passing plays in which receivers were expected to win against solid man coverage defenders without much scheming help. It seems the Lions offense expected much more success against these Packer corners. But in the end of the day, the Packers won on the backs of their defense.</p>

<p>The Lions were only able to finish in the end zone on one of their six scoring drives. The other scores came in the form of field goals that were ultimately not enough to win the game. The Packers defense stepped up their play at all three levels and kept this Lions offense under wraps after a disastrous first quarter.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-jaguars">Saints @ Jaguars</h2>

<p>Saints flashed some creative defensive coverages at Gardner Minshew. On one play, they baited Minshew into throwing to a receiver that ended up being in bracket coverage. On another play, linebackers threatened to blitz up the middle, only to drop away when the ball was snapped. Instead, it was two cornerbacks that ended up blitzing Minshew, one of whom was lined up along the trenches and the other lined up across a receiver. And on another play, Saints showed a man-underneath coverage that actually turned into zone coverage when the Jaguars tried to stack receivers.</p>

<p>Fournette seems to be a liability in pass coverage.</p>

			<h5 id="49ers-rams-3">49ers @ <em>Rams</em> (-3)</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little alarming to me that the books consider the 49ers and the Rams as (more or less) equal. One team has a better quarterback than the other. And that should make the difference here, more or less.</p>

<p>I see Wade Phillips stacking the box in order to stop the run game. Sure, his defensive backs will be left on their own against the 49ers&rsquo; skill players, but that&rsquo;s a gamble I&rsquo;m sure Wade is willing to take. The combination of Marcus Peters, Aqib Talib, Eric Weddle, and Taylor Rapp should be enough to keep an underperforming quarterback at bay.</p>

<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s defense will likely follow what other teams have done and try to stack the line of scrimmage in order to prevent the Rams from running their outside zone scheme. And sure, that&rsquo;ll work. But McVay&rsquo;s unit has still made a little hay in the run game, simply by running between the tackles instead. So Los Angeles has a workaround here that should help them sustain drives, even against the 49ers stout defensive front.</p>

<p><strong>Postmortem:</strong> The 49ers did not do what I expected from them. Instead of overloading the front on defense, San Francisco opted to stay with their regular four-man look. And it still worked. The 49ers defensive line reduced Jared Goff into a nervous wreck. The Rams have serious issues along their offensive line. And without any solid pass protection, Jared Goff has been exposed this season. I don&rsquo;t see the Rams as a viable playoff team anymore.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="seahawks-browns-1-5">Seahawks @ <em>Browns</em> (+1.5)</h5>

<p>The Browns have no business winning this game, according to the metrics. And yet, Freddie Kitchens and his team of characters will find a way to steal a win here and keep their Super Bowl delusions alive.</p>

<p>The reality here is that as bad as Freddie Kitchens has been so far this season, Pete Carroll hasn&rsquo;t been that much better. The Seahawks&rsquo; head coach has likely grown too old for the game - his approach is a little too stubborn and outdated for today&rsquo;s game. Teams shouldn&rsquo;t be emphasizing the run game over the pass game anymore. And yet, Carroll (and Zimmer) seem to think otherwise.</p>

<p>So give me the desperate (but not completely inept) Freddie Kitchens here over the aging Pete Carroll and a Seahawks team traveling across two time zones. It also helps that Steve Wilks has considerable experience facing off against this Seahawks team.</p>

<p><strong>Postmortem:</strong> It took four bloody turnovers for the Seahawks to close out this match with a win. If Baker played with just a bit more composure, Cleveland could have walked into their bye week with an ugly win. I don&rsquo;t regret this pick at all.</p>

<p>Also, Steve Wilks blows. I deserve to be dropkicked for using Steve Wilks to justify a pick.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="texans-chiefs-4-5">Texans @ <em>Chiefs</em> (-4.5)</h5>

<p>A little bit of a risky pick given Deshaun Watson and his penchant for late game heroic. But a Chiefs team coming off a loss and expecting the return of its deep threat in Tyreek Hill gives me faith here.</p>

<p>What really sells me on this pick is that Andy Reid faced off against this Texans squad just 2 years back. In that game, Alex Smith had a ball of a time throwing dimes all over the field against a weak Houston secondary. Fast forward to now and not much has changed. Houston&rsquo;s defense is still pathetic in the backfield. Romeo Crennel hasn&rsquo;t really changed his coverage schemes much. And I expect that to bite them in the ass yet again in Arrowhead.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>On second thought, after watching tape of that game back in 2017, I&rsquo;m not so impressed by the Chiefs&rsquo; offense against the Texans defense. Despite losing two of its three best pass rushers early in the game, Houston was able to force Kansas City into a number of third-and-long situations. The problem  was that the Chiefs were able to convert on most of those plays, despite the odds being against them. Some of those conversions came because of soft coverage on the part of the Texans, but other conversions came thanks to some great improvisational play by Alex Smith and Travis Kelce being a one-man wrecking crew. Either way, Kansas City&rsquo;s largely owes its offensive success to some terrific performances by a few key players - strategy only amounted to so much. Andy Reid doesn&rsquo;t have the Texans figured out like I originally assumed.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="eagles-vikings-3"><em>Eagles</em> @ Vikings (-3)</h5>

<p>The Vikings are just <em>so</em> damn childish with their emphasis on running the ball on early downs. And it&rsquo;s this stubborn devotion to the run that&rsquo;ll be their undoing against teams that can adapt against formulaic opponents. The Eagles under Jim Schwartz and Doug Pederson are one of those teams.</p>

<p>Besides, I&rsquo;d rather trust Carson Wentz over Kirk Cousins.</p>

<p><strong>Postmortem:</strong> The Eagles have lost their pass rushing edge. And without that ability to rush the passer effectively, Philadelphia&rsquo;s entire defensive backfield has been exposed. The Vikings had a ball of a time airing out the ball against a hopeless Eagles secondary. Kirk Cousins finally rekindled things with Stefon Diggs, though I still have my doubts about whether their relationship can survive road trips&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="titans-broncos-2">Titans @ <em>Broncos</em> (-2)</h5>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m falling for a trap here, but the Broncos being such short favorites against another formulaic team in the Titans seems wrong to me. Granted, the Broncos defense isn&rsquo;t built as well as the Bills defense that stoned the Tennessee offense last week, but Vic Fangio should prepare this team well against a Titans team that identifies as a run-first unit.</p>

<p><strong>Postmortem:</strong> Mariota is trash. I&rsquo;m so happy I called this one correctly.</p>

			<h2 id="vikings-giants">Vikings @ Giants</h2>

<p>Zimmer cannot still shake off his pathological conservative nature on offense. On a 3rd &amp; 20 play in the red zone, Zimmer opted for the shotgun draw.</p>

<p>Jabrill Peppers has been beastly against the run today.</p>

<p>Giants zone defense is simply lousy, as expected.</p>

<p>Dalvin Cook is something special.</p>

<p>Daniel Jones seems to genuinely enjoy throwing outside the numbers, even against tight coverage. The Giants need more X-style receivers that could catch those contested balls.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-cowboys">Packers @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>Read-option slants aren&rsquo;t the best option against man coverage, Cowboys.</p>

<p>The Packers two starting cornerbacks (Jaire Alexander and Kevin King) along with the team&rsquo;s two starting edge rushers (Preston Smith and Za&rsquo;Darius Smith) are truly something. Those four players form the foundation for one of the NFL&rsquo;s better defenses.</p>

<p>The Packers defense has an affinity for dime coverages on passing downs, leaving them a little vulnerable against opposing rushers. If only the Cowboys recognized this&hellip;</p>

<p>Garrett has little juice.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="colts-chiefs">Colts @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Colts have a hard time working out of negative game script.</p>

<p>Colts are shameless in their commitment to the run, but it&rsquo;s working. The Chiefs and their scrub defense are no match for a cohesive Indianapolis front - the Colts offensive line are winning the battle in the trenches.</p>

<p>Mahomes is stripped of his magic due to a limp. He&rsquo;s still making some pretty passes though.</p>

<p>Frank Reich is one of the best coaches in the league. To take a team decimated by injuries into incredibly hostile territory and to win outright as double-digit underdogs is impressive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="buccaneers-saints">Buccaneers @ Saints</h2>

<p>Jameis Winston is an amalgamation of good and bad quarterbacking. As simple as that.</p>

<p>Saints maintaining balance between the run and the pass, despite Tampa Bay supposedly being much better at defending the run compared to the pass.</p>

<p>Ronald Jones is quite the speedster halfback for Tampa Bay.</p>

<p>Bucs seem content prioritizing the run over the passing game, at least for a few first-half drives.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay seems almost powerless against Michael Thomas.</p>

<p>Teddy Bridgewater showing development, throwing deep on several occasions against a rather weak Tampa Bay secondary.</p>

<p>Winston making bad decisions and erratic throws against this Saints. It&rsquo;s almost as if this team has him shook. Either that or playing his second straight road game has taken the edge off his quarterbacking.</p>

<p>This referee crew seems far more lenient when it comes to pass interference.</p>

<p>Once again, Tampa Bay has sold itself on the run being more important than the pass in this game. Quite interesting considering the number of receiving weapons the team boasts on offense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bears-vs-raiders-london">Bears vs Raiders (London)</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear the Bears didn&rsquo;t really give much of a shit to prepare for this game. Sloppy play on both sides of the ball, the Raiders making hay mostly by rushing Josh Jacobs and throwing short passes, flying into London late into the week&hellip;all these things indicate that Chicago was content trying to wing this game. I feel like a damn fool picking the Bears here. Let it be known that an underprepared team is a likely loser.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="browns-49ers">Browns @ 49ers</h2>

<p>Cleveland making some serious hay with some brilliantly-executed misdirection plays.</p>

<p>But once a funk sets in, this Browns team deflates quickly.</p>

<p>The 49ers chewing up a lot of yardage with that outside zone rushing attack. I wonder if the same game plan that teams use to attack the Rams will apply here with the 49ers.</p>

<p>Garoppolo has been frankly disappointing. Need to see him carry a game for once against a respectable team.</p>

<p>Baker honestly has issues seeing open receivers. I wonder if throws up the middle are all the more difficult now that it&rsquo;s been confirmed that Baker cannot see past the line of scrimmage at times.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-bengals">Cardinals @ Bengals</h2>

<p>Cardinals cannot seemingly stop Joe Mixon from running between the tackles. One of the Bengals&rsquo; successful drives was predicated on Mixon being able to run all over the Cardinals.</p>

<p>Finally, some ballsiness by the Cardinals to go for a 4th down on a goal-to-go situation. Before that though, Arizona was able to matriculate down the field with designed runs, surprisingly. Seems as if the Cardinals are seeing the light and committing more to the run.</p>

			<h2 id="jaguars-broncos">Jaguars @ Broncos</h2>

<p>Jaguar linebackers not playing disciplined against misdirection plays.</p>

<p>Jacksonville doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much of a red zone playbook.</p>

<p>Jalen Ramsey&rsquo;s understudy not doing all too well. But in his defense, the Broncos were able to move the ball on him thanks largely to some well-drawn plays.</p>

<p>Those plays involved wide receivers running crossing routes on third down in order to create space for a halfback coming out of the backfield, running play-action off a heavy formation, and then motioning a tailback away from the pocket in order to create a throwing lane up the seam for Flacco.</p>

<p>The Jaguars&rsquo; offensive tackles are points of weakness.</p>

<p>Fournette was able to chew off some serious yardage early in the second half behind the I-formation fullback runs.</p>

<p>Minshew is magical with his elusiveness in the pocket.</p>

<p>Timely zone blitz by the Jaguars to end a critical Broncos drive.</p>

<p>Minshew magic is a real thing. This whole team ups its game when Minshew magic is in effect.</p>

<p>Zone blitzes throw off the Broncos and their attempt to dump off passes to leaking halfbacks.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-saints">Cowboys @ Saints</h2>

<p>The Saints should have a hard time running their offense from a negative game script, given Bridgewater is more a game manager than anything else.</p>

			<h2 id="titans-jaguars">Titans @ Jaguars</h2>

<p>The Jaguars insist on running a zone coverage scheme that forces their linebackers to run around the field and even blanket receivers at times. It&rsquo;s not good when Jacksonville has a slow bunch of linebackers outside of Myles Jack.</p>

<p>Jacksonville is still trying to build an offensive identity around Leonard Fournette instead of the passing game. The Titans are keying in on Fournette though, stalling the Jaguars anemic offense.</p>

<p>Mariota sucks.</p>

<p>The Titans will run that ball with reckless abandon until it works, dammit.</p>

<p>Minshew seems to like throwing his deep balls outside the numbers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ravens-chiefs">Ravens @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>The Chiefs are hopeless at rushing the passer. Chris Jones is the only quality pass rusher on that team. Frank Clark hasn&rsquo;t been living up to his billing.</p>

<p>Michael Lombardi may be right - this Ravens offense has a hard time recovering from negative plays.</p>

<p>Once again, horrendous clock management from Andy Reid as the first half winds down.</p>

<p>Gus Edwards has been beastly, breaking tackles and accelerating quickly.</p>

<p>Ravens offense adjusted in the second half by hammering the ball on the ground. First drive was nothing but runs. It&rsquo;s clear the Chiefs prioritized defending the pass here.</p>

<p>Chiefs should have covered. But two lucky heaves by Lamar Jackson kept the Ravens within one score. Goddammit. Ravens are a team with fight though.</p>

<p>Cameron Irving is a point of weakness along that Chiefs offensive line.</p>

<p>The Chiefs may have issues picking up delay and zone blitzes, similar to what I saw last year when Kansas City faced the Patriots before the Super Bowl.</p>

<p>Add overload blitzes to the short list of issues dragging these Chiefs down. Even against five and six-man fronts, the Chiefs offensive line tends to slide protection towards one direction, usually letting one defender come free from the opposite edge. Usually, Kansas counters this by dumping the ball off on the halfback leaking out of the backfield.</p>

<p>The Ravens won the battle in the trenches throughout the game with creative blitz concepts. Of the times that Mahomes was left with a clean pocket, I noticed that play-action and quarterback roll-outs were used on a few of those plays.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="lions-eagles">Lions @ Eagles</h2>

<p>Outside zone runs may be effective against Detroit&rsquo;s bigger, slower front.</p>

<p>Detroit runs quite a bit of 11 personnel for a team that&rsquo;s reputedly run-heavy.</p>

<p>Philly&rsquo;s secondary is lousy. Darby especially has lost some of his touch. Not good when the top cornerback on your roster fails to perform adequately.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="giants-buccaneers">Giants @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Daniel Jones can run with the ball. Offensive playbook even has designed runs for him.</p>

<p>Janoris Jenkins is not an elite corner.</p>

<p>In the second half, Giants defense has shifted to a two-safety look with man coverage underneath. It seems to be enough to keep Jameis from moving the ball on them at will.</p>

<p>Also worth noting - Jameis sucks. Buccaneers need to get rid of him. Maybe even trade up for Justin Herbert or whatever his name is.</p>

<p>Winston would be murdered by a team with a solid pass rush, the way he holds on to the ball. His pocket presence is horrendous.</p>

<p>Shaq Barrett something special. Buccaneers made a solid pick-up in free agency here.</p>

<p>Daniel Jones holds on to the ball like a damn fool too.</p>

<p>Buccaneers playing prevent defense on the Giants on the last drive was their downfall. Credit to Daniel Jones for picking apart their weak defensive scheme. And credit to the Giants for stunting the Buccaneers&rsquo; offense somehow. I need to review tape here&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-browns">Rams @ Browns</h2>

<p>Browns have serious issues guarding shifty receivers.</p>

<p>Cooper Kupp is the best receiver on the Rams.</p>

<p>Wade Phillips adjusted quickly on defense. Rams defense were embarrassed on a long third down when a blitz left them helpless to defend against a halfback screen. The second time the Browns tried to pull off the same trick, a linebacker shadowed the Browns tailback and took him down before the screen was even set.</p>

<p>Browns made a bizarre call on a fourth and long, calling a draw run. Just idiotic.</p>

<p>Goff&rsquo;s play clock management on the road is just poor. Waiting too long to call for the snap. Nearly cost the Rams a first down when McVay called a time-out immediately before the ball was snapped on what actually ended up being a successful throw to move the chains.</p>

<p>Baker Mayfield having to hold on to the ball and manufacture a play is not a pretty sight. Plays have to unfold like they&rsquo;re drawn up in order for the Browns signal caller to be successful.</p>

<p>The Browns lack any creative red zone plays to try and make an emergency touchdown.</p>

<p>Once again, the Browns&rsquo; lack of discipline at preventing penalties kept some Ram drives alive or more fruitful.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-chargers">Texans @ Chargers</h2>

<p>Texans secondary is still incredibly problematic. The off coverage in particular is worrying.</p>

<p>DJ Reader stepping up as a solid pass rusher.</p>

<p>Gus Bradley does not have much of a taste for blitzes, apparently. In fact, he may have more of a liking for three-man rushes than for blitzes, sadly.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="panthers-cardinals">Panthers @ Cardinals</h2>

<p>Kyler Murray being able to run off the read option seems to be an important part of the Cardinals offense.</p>

<p>Cardinals seem to be more prone to using wide receiver screens as part of their otherwise barebones red zone package.</p>

<p>Kyle Allen playing well, especially under pressure. Keeps his eyes down the field.</p>

<p>Carolina has a package of reverses in their offensive repertoire. One example is a two-layered wide receiver sweep.</p>

<p>Mario Addison with a timely sack to end a Cardinal drive.</p>

<p>Arizona is lousy at defending tight ends.</p>

<p>Kyle Allen&rsquo;s first two touchdowns came from traditional drop-back plays. Impressive.</p>

<p>Carolina&rsquo;s secondary is playing very well. Quite disciplined in their zone coverage.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="broncos-packers">Broncos @ Packers</h2>

<p>Broncos love their three-man rushes, for some stupid reason.</p>

<p>Flacco not showing any confidence by abandoning the pocket early on a critical third down.</p>

<p>Garrett Bolles could have cost the team a touchdown.</p>

			<h2 id="ravens-chiefs-6-5">Ravens @ <em>Chiefs</em> (-6.5)</h2>

<p>I initially sides with the Ravens here, especially as 7-point underdogs. But a bit more probing into this match-up and I uncovered a few things that worried me. One, Lamar Jackson is playing almost too well as a passer given his performance from last year. The man is due for regression soon, and what better place to regress than a stadium famed for exposing quarterbacks playing far above their pay grade. Two, the Ravens pass defense showed some vulnerabilities last week against the Cardinals and their Air Raid attack. It makes sense, given that great defenses one year almost always regress the following year. The Ravens defense this year was bound to lose some of its teeth, having lost major players at all levels of the defense to free agency or injury. And that makes things easier for Patrick Mahomes and all of his weapons. Speaking of which, it&rsquo;s also worth noting that this is the home opener for the Chiefs.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="raiders-vikings-8-5">Raiders @ <em>Vikings</em> (-8.5)</h2>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this a great game for the Vikings? Exactly one of those games where the Vikings make a statement following an embarrassing loss to a bitter rival. And the Raiders are the perfect team to crush into a pulp too, what with the team being bottom-tier league fodder. Too many things are going in the Vikings favor here, making Minnesota a tempting pick despite the high spread.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="steelers-49ers-6-5"><em>Steelers</em> @ 49ers (-6.5)</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little worrying to side with Pittsburgh here given that the 49ers are playing in their home opener here. It&rsquo;s all the more worrying when the Steelers are starting an untested quarterback while San Francisco is fielding an offense that just dropped 40 points the week before. But once again, I have faith in Mike Tomlin and his coaching staff will make some bold moves here to keep Pittsburgh competitive in this game.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Shanahan&rsquo;s offense can be stopped so long as defenders remain disciplined and their rushing game can be stunted. While the Steelers lost some of their composure late last week against the Seahawks, Pittsburgh still managed to keep things close.</p>

<p>Not to mention Pittsburgh does have an ace card here - the surprise factor involved when a new quarterback is thrusted into a starter role. Defensive coaches don&rsquo;t have much game footage on Mason Rudolph, so it&rsquo;ll be hard getting a beat on the young man&rsquo;s tendencies and habits.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="panthers-cardinals-3"><em>Panthers</em> @ Cardinals (-3)</h2>

<p>Like the Steelers, the Panthers are starting an untested quarterback on the road, albeit against a different NFC West club. Still, I feel better about this pick compared to the Pittsburgh pick, even though Carolina is only being given three points here.</p>

<p>The reality is that this Arizona team is still developing an identity on offense. Kliff Kingsbury is still feeling his way around as a rookie head coach, given all the mistakes he made last week against the Ravens.</p>

<p>The Panthers, on the other hand, are a desperate team still looking for their first victory of the season. I think that desperation is the extra juice they need to win this game outright. Not to mention the surprise factor involved whenever a team starts a new quarterback that doesn&rsquo;t have much footage out there that can be studied.</p>

<p>One thing worth noting before I close this out&hellip;Kawann Short is questionable. As the best pass rusher on the team, Short is absolutely critical here to the Panthers&rsquo; chances of winning this game. Carolina&rsquo;s secondary is nowhere near competent enough to keep the Cardinals&rsquo; air raid under control. The Panthers need to harass Kyler Murray on a regular basis if they want to cap Arizona&rsquo;s offense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-browns-3"><em>Rams</em> @ Browns (+3)</h2>

<p>Against my own personal inclination to see the Browns win a major primetime game here, give me the more cohesive team here with the better coaches and the experience of having played so many spotlight games over the past couple years. Jared Goff&rsquo;s pedestrian quarterbacking gives me some pause here, but it&rsquo;s not like Baker Mayfield has been lighting the world on fire this season. Not to mention losing a major weapon like David Njoku will hurt this offense - it robs them of a vector on offense.</p>

			<h2 id="bills-giants">Bills @ Giants</h2>

<p>The Bills&rsquo; man coverage is real.</p>

<p>The Giants&rsquo; man coverage is lame though. DeAndre Baker is a particular point of weakness.</p>

<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for some early runs from Saquon Barkley and slant routes, the Giants offense would have been complete rudderless.</p>

<p>Josh Allen is committing to staying in the pocket. Though it&rsquo;s easy to do so considering New York&rsquo;s gutless pass rush.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="49ers-bengals">49ers @ Bengals</h2>

<p>Kwan Alexander is quite passionate and embraces the leadership role he&rsquo;s been given on defense.</p>

<p>The Bengals are looking hopeless at defending against teams that are good at running the ball. Outside runs in particular bewilder Cincinnati&rsquo;s defense.</p>

<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s misdirection on play-action resulting in big plays.</p>

<p>Lack of creativity by the Bengals offense. Was the game plan here really to simply drop Andy Dalton back five or seven paces behind his offensive line and have him sling the ball to his receivers, with an occasional run by Joe Mixon?</p>

<p>Cincinnati&rsquo;s defense is a mess in coverage and run defense.</p>

<p>Playing from behind leaves the Cincinnati offense in a bit of a precarious situation, given their offensive line kinda sucks in pass protection</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chargers-lions">Chargers @ Lions</h2>

<p>Chargers run defense still remains suspect despite Thomas Davis now patrolling the middle of the field as the team&rsquo;s lead linebacker.</p>

<p>Austin Ekeler is a beast.</p>

<p>The Chargers run solid screens with Ekeler. Two big screens mostly negated due to iffy penalties, sadly.  Craif Wrolstad and his referees are a litigious bunch.</p>

<p>The replacement place kicker is truly terrible. The Chargers <strong>desperately</strong> need their primary field goal kicker back in action.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="seahawks-steelers">Seahawks @ Steelers</h2>

<p>Donte Moncrief is a liability at receiver, dropping passes and even bouncing them towards opposing defensive backs on one occasion.</p>

<p>Steelers defense can be picked apart. Their zone blitzing naturally leaves them vulnerable at certain spots along their defense. And their zone coverage can be exploited by capable tight ends.</p>

<p>Mason Rudolph can run if need be.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-ravens">Cardinals @ Ravens</h2>

<p>Lamar shows a preference for throwing to tight-ends and receivers running slants across the middle of the field.</p>

<p>I really do think Lamar is fond of his tight-ends. The Ravens need to load their roster with quality tight-ends.</p>

<p>Christian Kirk is a gamer.</p>

<p>Good man coverage across the board can really limit the Cardinals and their air raid.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="eagles-falcons">Eagles @ Falcons</h2>

<p>Isaac Seumalo is a point of weakness along the Eagles offensive line.</p>

<p>Grady Jarrett is a beast. Easily the best pass rusher on Atlanta&rsquo;s defensive line.</p>

<p>Creative blitzes by Jim Schwartz is throwing Matt Ryan off his game and keeping the Eagles alive in this game. Worth noting that these blitzes usually  mandate man coverage with no safety patrolling the deep field.</p>

<p>Carson Wentz playing sensationally despite not having either Desean Jackson or Alshon Jeffery on offense.</p>

<p>Calvin Ridley is undoubtedly the Falcons&rsquo; second receiver.</p>

<p>Considering the injury circumstances and the emotional edge in this game going to the Falcons, the Eagles were the better team here.</p>

			<h4 id="49ers-bengals-2-0">49ers @ <em>Bengals</em> (-2.0)</h4>

<p>Kind of weird for me to go with a team that I ranked as a dreg-tier team before the season. But Cincinnati truly impressed me last week, going up to the Clink to face off against a Seattle defense that prepped well for a McVay-style offense. Instead, the Bengals offense seems to have developed its own identity, one that suits Andy Dalton from what I saw last week. The Bengals are a far better team than I thought them to be - to my chagrin, coach Zac Taylor seems to know what he’s doing. I expect them to punk this underperforming 49ers team.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> And the Bengals were listed as a dreg-tier team for a reason. Cincinnati&rsquo;s defense was utterly hopeless against Shanahan&rsquo;s offense. This game made obvious that these Bengals are <em>terrible</em> defensing against the run.</p>

<h4 id="colts-titans-3"><em>Colts</em> @ Titans (-3)</h4>

<p>I don’t think all that much of the Titans smacking around the Browns last week. What concerns me about Tennessee here is that Derrick Henry is the focal point of their offense, instead of Marcus Mariota. It tells me quite a bit about what the coaches think of their young signal caller. In contrast, the Colts look as if they’re comfortable with Jacoby Brissett under center. I think Frank Reich’s dominance of these Titans will not be stopped in this game.</p>

<h4 id="seahawks-steelers-4">Seahawks @ <em>Steelers</em> (-4)</h4>

<p>It’s hard for me to initially side with these Steelers after their dismal showing last week against the Patriots. But the Seahawks weren’t that much better in their own game against the Bengals. It still looks to me that Seattle is still developing an identity on offense that maximizes the contributions of their noteworthy skill players. And they’re taking their sweet time figuring things out too unfortunately. Given Pittsburgh’s history of turning things around fairly quickly, I expect the Steelers offense to see more success here than Seattle’s. Playing on their home turf will also help Pittsburgh settle into a groove quicker.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem</em></strong>: Roethlisberger being knocked out of the game with an elbow injury sort of threw a wrench into the Steelers&rsquo; game plan, to say the least. Still, Mason Rudolph served admirably as an emergency quarterback. It wasn&rsquo;t enough though - Russell Wilson managed to score on four separate drives. This Pittsburgh defense has a real issue guarding tight ends running seam routes.</p>

<h4 id="bears-broncos-2-5">Bears @ <em>Broncos</em> (+2.5)</h4>

<p>Nobody should know Mitch Trubisky’s little quirks and tendencies better than the defensive coordinator that sparred with him in practice for the last two years. Combine that with the thin air of Mile High Stadium and the Bears offense should put forth another hopeless performance this season. So long as Flacco keeps his incontinence under control on a few drives, Denver can put up just enough points to steal a win here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> The Broncos <em>barely</em> covered. Joe Flacco is a terrible quarterback. It&rsquo;s so difficult to trust this Denver team outside of Mile High Stadium.</p>

<h4 id="saints-rams-2-5"><em>Saints</em> @ Rams (-2.5)</h4>

<p>The Rams played terribly last week. Makes me wonder if the last Super Bowl actually exposed their weaknesses to the rest of the league. Either way, the team still has one of the best coaches in the league in Sean McVay. But I would argue the Saints have a better coach in Sean Payton. That, the revenge angle, and the fact that Drew Brees is much better than Jared Goff has me siding with the Saints. Taking the points is nice too.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> Drew Brees sustaining a serious thumb injury on his throwing hand ruined any chances the Saints had of covering this game.</p>
