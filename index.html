	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Philadelphia Eagles</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Eagles have managed to win the NFC East after so much drama. Let&rsquo;s see if they can actually survive a game or two though. We&rsquo;ll evaluate them using the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes. It&rsquo;s been painful watching the Eagles this year, but these past few weeks have shown me Philadelphia has demonstrated enough resilience and grit to be considered mentally tough. It takes some fortitude to survive games the past two weeks while so many people on your roster are going down like flies. So I will give them kudos here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Jim Schwartz has always been one of the better defensive minds in the business. Nothing has changed this year to indicate otherwise. In fact, the team&rsquo;s success this year is more attributable to Schwartz than anybody else this year. Despite injuries wrecking his secondary for a bunch of games and his defensive line underperforming on a few occasions, Schwartz has kept his unit playing at a high level. Constant reorganizations were managed well throughout the season, as depth players were prepared to step up and play serviceably enough in relief duty.</p>

<p>Nothing better demonstrates Schwartz&rsquo;s aptitude than the way the defense played against the Cowboys in the division championship. Yes, Dak was injured somewhat, but the defensive backfield played very well in coverage, batting away balls and keeping the Cowboys receiving threats under wraps for the most part. It was a surprising showing from a unit many people assumed would be the weakest part of their defense. Schwartz deserves credit for training his defensive backs well.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately not. While the offensive line has plenty of playoff experience, Carson Wentz and a few of key skill players will be officially playing in their first playoff game. How quick Wentz will be able to calm his nerves will largely determine their final destination in the playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually the most difficult question to answer. Wentz has shown his mettle at times, leading at least five drives to outright win games or maintain leads. He should be credited for a game-winning drive against the Falcons as well, but his receiver dropped the ball at a crucial moment unfortunately.</p>

<p>Still, he&rsquo;s had a number of dull performances. This Eagles offense almost seemed rudderless at times with him at its helm. Even some games that he won were far more harrowing than they needed to be - some of those comebacks shouldn&rsquo;t have been needed in the first place. Injuries and bad coaching have played a role, but the quarterback has to assume some responsibility as well.  His negative expected completion rate isn&rsquo;t doing him any favors.</p>

<p>Because of these doubts, I can&rsquo;t classify him as an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>No. While the Eagles can coach up players, I question their play-calling their times. Their commitment to the ground game borders on obstinacy at times, though the rushing attack has won them two games.</p>

<p>What really worries me is that the Eagles possess far more talent on offense than so many other teams and yet I see too many drives stopped short. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me, especially with a capable quarterback like Carson Wentz at the helm of the offense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know. We have three eligible candidates here - <strong><em>Derek Barnett</em></strong>, <strong><em>Fletcher Cox</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Brandon Graham</em></strong>. Neither one have truly stood out consistently enough from my observations. In the key rematch against the Dallas Cowboys, neither of the three were able to mount much pressure, though Derek Barnett may have been playing hurt. Against the Giants in the last week of the regular season, all three had a moment, but I didn&rsquo;t see enough consistency.</p>

<p>Their numbers aren&rsquo;t very impressive as well, though it may be more a function</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s very likely to me that at least one of the three stands out during the postseason. And it&rsquo;s quite possible another of the group will rise up.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Eagles actually have five different vectors on offense.</p>

<p>The most important vectors are the tight ends - <strong><em>Zach Ertz</em></strong> and  <strong><em>Dallas Goedert</em></strong>. Both have the ability to run routes and make tough catches. And Carson Wentz seems to have an affinity for his tight ends, given his targeting numbers.</p>

<p>On the receiver end, we have <strong><em>Greg Ward</em></strong> as a surprise breakout star now that the offense can no longer count on the services of Alshon Jeffery nor DeSean Jackson. On the rushing end, <strong><em>Miles Sanders</em></strong> has done a fantastic job as a rookie tailback, working in concert with a solid offensive line. His ability to catch the balls out of the backfield also serves this team well.</p>

<p>One more vector here is <strong><em>Carson Wentz</em></strong>. Though his passing may be shaky at times, his ability to scramble can sustain drives when plays don&rsquo;t develop as expected.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>No. Jake Elliott has not been so clutch over the past several weeks, missing four field goals, three of which would have helped to end the game sooner in the Eagles favor.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Malcolm Jenkins definitely ranks as an elite player.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Eagles have their fair share of strengths and weaknesses. If Carson Wentz can play past his inexperience and connect well with his weapons on offense, a division round invitation is in order. And while the Eagles will not be the favorite up against the 49ers, I do believe they&rsquo;ll give San Francisco a run for their money.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Seattle Seahawks</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Seahawks are returning to the playoffs once again as a wild card team. Let&rsquo;s see if their fortunes will be better this year using my lovely little rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes. Once again returning to this idea that mental fortitude is primarily a function of the head coach, I&rsquo;d be remiss to doubt Pete Carroll and the attitude that he instills in his team.</p>

<p>Granted, the team has fallen short on a few occasions or even nearly coughed up the lead in other games, but the Hawks still have that resilience, probably best exemplified by their near-successful comeback against the 49ers in the season finale, despite being so utterly outplayed and out-coached.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, no. Even though Carroll once led the Legion of Boom early in the decade, his grasp on defensive concepts seems to have slipped over the years.</p>

<p>The Seahawks have coughed up nearly 6000 yards on defense this year. They&rsquo;ve won games sloppily against teams that ate up yardage against their defense. Matt Schaub managed to post 460 yards against their defense, albeit in a futile effort as the game was out of hand.</p>

<p>People can argue that Carroll&rsquo;s defenses are more than happy to give up yardage when the Seahawks are blowing out the other team on the scoreboard. Sure, but the Seahawks back in their Legion of Boom days were infamously stingy, even with big leads.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes. With the exception of a few rookies, most of the Seahawks have considerable playoff experience, including Russell Wilson.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes. Russell Wilson was in the conversation for MVP before Lamar Jackson really broke out as the favorite. Still, he&rsquo;s put in some remarkable performances, including a nearly legendary comeback against the 49ers that fell short due to bad coaching.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Once again, no. The offense can be unbearably flaccid at times and all too content playing some uninspiring football with the lead in hand. Brian Schottenheimer has done little to field an efficient and creative offense, despite having one of the best quarterbacks in the game heading his offense. Even in their pivotal game against the 49ers, the Seahawks were gutless on offense until the game was essentially forced into Russell Wilson&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>None. Jadaveon Clowney may be the one person on this team closest to being considered elite, but his boom-or-bust production over the course of the season only invalidates such a consideration - an elite pass rusher needs to rack up pressures and tackles and be <strong><em>consistent</em></strong> at it.</p>

<p>Nobody else even comes close.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Tyler Lockett</em></strong> and <strong><em>D.K. Metcalf</em></strong> are the only skill players that can be safely considered reliable vectors on offense, the former known for his speed and route-running ability while the latter is known more as a receiver that can make those contested catches outside the number. Chris Carson would have been on this list had his season not ended due to a hip injury.</p>

<p><strong><em>Russell Wilson</em></strong> can add himself to this list as well given his ability to run the ball, either off read-options or scrambles.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>No. Jason Myers has missed one too many kicks in critical moments for me to certify him as a reliable field goal kicker. Not to mention he&rsquo;s shanked a few extra point attempts.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>No. The Seahawks have one of the worst backfields in the league, as no one player has stood out from those ranks.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Seahawks have too many deficiencies to go far. With a little bit of luck, Seattle can advance to the division round and possibly lose a closer-than-expected race against the 49ers, but it seems more probable to me that the Hawks will be downed by their fellow birds of prey in the Eagles.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - New England Patriots</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Patriots are seeing Wild Card weekend for the first time in over ten years, shockingly. So let&rsquo;s examine their prospects using my trusty old rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>One would think so going solely off history. But in reality, this team shouldn&rsquo;t have lost the way it did against the Dolphins last week. It was an embarrassing loss to a team listed as double-digit underdogs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure anymore. The Patriots have lost three of their last five games. Two of those losses came back-to-back. The will to win is there, but the talent and execution is not. Brady, McDaniels, and Belichick have known about this team&rsquo;s offensive issues since the beginning of the season and yet, these three seem almost powerless to overcome their woes.</p>

<p>Still, mental toughness is usually a function of the head coach, and it&rsquo;s impossible for me to doubt Bill Belichick given his pedigree. So I&rsquo;ll give the Patriots the benefit of the doubt here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes, Bill Belichick is still one of the best at coaching defenses, let alone teams. His defense this year is the gold standard at pass coverage.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>No doubt.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yet another question difficult to answer. Brady has underthrown quite a few passes this year. He&rsquo;s unable to develop any rapport with his young receiving corps this year. Some of the touch on his throws must be lost, as he&rsquo;s not really attempting tight-window throws anymore.</p>

<p>But the mind is still there. The raw football intelligence is still there. It&rsquo;s a quality that never truly leaves the greats, that genius level of knowledge about a particular subject that renders itself indelibly into the recesses of the minds of the greats.</p>

<p>Still&hellip;the very fact I have doubt here is enough for me to say no, Brady is no longer an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Josh McDaniels is one of the better offensive minds in the league today. The Patriots have made hay using scheming and trick plays to put points on the board. Were it not for these plays being so cleverly scripted into the flow of the game, New England&rsquo;s offense would be abysmal instead of just miserable.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Kyle Van Noy</em></strong> can definitely be considered an elite pass rusher, given his consistently solid play over the course of the season. While his pass rushing numbers aren&rsquo;t as gaudy as one would expect, we have to keep in mind that Belichick defenses typically ask a great deal more from their pass rushers - Kyle Van Noy saw quite a bit of coverage work as well throughout the season.</p>

<p>And really, if Van Noy is on this list despite the lack of spectacular statistics, then one could make a very strong argument for <strong><em>Dont&rsquo;a Hightower</em></strong>.  Hightower was actually more productive on a per-rush basis, tallying up at least 13 quarterback hits despite rushing only half as much as Van Noy.</p>

<p>Somebody could make an argument for <strong><em>Jamie Collins</em></strong>, but I&rsquo;ll shy away from that, as it&rsquo;s quite clear Bill prefers to use Collins far more in coverage than as an actual pass rusher.</p>

<p>Still, we have two confirmed elite pass rushers and one man that can play like a stud rusher depending on the game plan. The Patriots are in good shape here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>On the other hand, the Patriots are not in so good a shape here. <strong><em>Julian Edelman</em></strong> is clearly a vector given the trust Brady has vested in him, but Edelman&rsquo;s inclusion as a vector is only meaningful so long as he remains healthy <em>enough</em> over the course of the postseason. Injuries have hammered him repeatedly through the season and it seems as if things will be no different for the playoffs.</p>

<p><strong><em>James White</em></strong> is the only other player that I can confidently assert as a vector here, given his ability to catch balls out of the backfield.</p>

<p>I have a hard time considering <strong><em>Sony &ldquo;Playstation&rdquo; Michel</em></strong> and <strong><em>Rex Burkhead</em></strong> a vector here as the Patriots offensive line have been pretty flaccid in their run-blocking. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Patriots have been much better running the ball the past three weeks, so we can&rsquo;t confidently rule out the ground game as a possible vector.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Surprisingly, yes. Despite their struggles over the season with field goals, it seems the Patriots finally found somebody that can kick them through the uprights consistently. Folk only missed three field goals all year, two in inclement weather and one that was blocked when the Patriots line broke down inside.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Stephon Gilmore. One could also include Devin McCourty with his five interceptions.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Patriots are not nearly as bad as the media narratives claim. Still, their limp offense will cost them dearly on the road in Kansas City.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Tennessee Titans</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>A resurgent Titans squad led by Ryan Tannehill has muscled their way into the playoffs. Let&rsquo;s look at their playoff prospects using the rubric outlined <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes, sufficiently so. After benching their franchise quarterback for a burn-out from Miami, one would be forgiven for thinking the Titans were done for the season. Instead, their fortunes swung upward - the team found renewed life with a quarterback that wasn&rsquo;t afraid to lob the ball into smaller, riskier windows.</p>

<p>Their goal-line stand against the Chargers in Tannehill&rsquo;s first game as a starter, their surprise wins over the Chiefs and Colts, their respectable performances even in defeat&hellip;all these things point to a team that&rsquo;s not short on resilience.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Hard to say, but I&rsquo;d lean towards no. I respect Mike Vrabel and Dean Pees and the work they&rsquo;ve done in their past stints. But it&rsquo;s clear that this Tennessee defense has holes at all three levels. Would things would be worse or better if an average set of coaches were managing the defense? I can&rsquo;t answer for sure.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one example I can use that makes me doubt the minds behind this defense, it was their loose coverage of Michael Thomas a couple weeks ago when the Saints came to town. Being that Thomas is playing at an unreal level right now, one would think it&rsquo;d be wise to bracket him or pay extra attention to him when you execute zone blitzes against Drew Brees. The Titans did neither.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>A good number of the players on the offense have playoff experience, but unfortunately, the quarterback is missing postseason experience on his resume. Ryan Tannehill&rsquo;s first outing as a playoff quarterback will likely result in a few screw-ups.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes, actually. I dare say Tannehill is an elite quarterback. Maybe it&rsquo;s the air in Nashville or the moonshine from the Tennessee backwoods, but Tannehill has found new life under Mike Vrabel and his coaching staff. It&rsquo;s not just the fact that his completion percentage has soared past expectations more than anybody else in the league, according to Next Gen Stats. It&rsquo;s his toughness. I&rsquo;ve seen him get his ass kicked in the game against the Colts and yet, the man still stood in the pocket and make big-time throws.</p>

<p>His skill players have done their fair share to lift this team&rsquo;s fortunes, sure, but it wasn&rsquo;t until Ryan Tannehill was inserted into the lineup as a starter that the offense began realizing its full potential. And that&rsquo;s usually the hallmark of an elite quarterback - being able to lift the play of all his fellow players by his presence alone</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Arthur Smith has molded this offense into one of the better units in the league. Ryan Tannehill certainly helps bolsters his case, but it&rsquo;s more the gadget plays that justify his consideration here as a chess player. Smith has a package of misdirection and up-tempo plays that he usually invokes towards the end of the game to seal away wins. And these plays are remarkably effective as well, having actually won games for the Titans against serious competition.</p>

<p>One can argue that his religious devotion to the run is a bit foolish given that rushing is not nearly as valuable as passing in today&rsquo;s NFL. Still, when you have quite possibly the league&rsquo;s most productive rushing attack, it&rsquo;s hard to blame him for committing so much time and energy to the ground game.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>Arguably none. The only player worthy of consideration here is <strong><em>Harold Landry</em></strong>. Yet nowhere in my notes have I taken notice of Landry. His raw pass-rush numbers are unimpressive as well compared to other players in the same position. If he is to be classified as an elite pass rusher, it would be more so off the back of his strong run defense. But that wouldn&rsquo;t make sense, because we&rsquo;re looking first and foremost for pass rushers here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p><strong><em>AJ Brown</em></strong> and <strong><em>Derrick Henry</em></strong> deserve vector status, without question. The former will be the offensive rookie of the year and the latter is the rushing champion of the league.</p>

<p>Other than that, it is hard to find a third vector for this team. <strong><em>Jonnu Smith</em></strong>, <strong><em>Adam Humphries</em></strong>, <strong><em>Corey Davis,</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tajae Sharpe,</em></strong> but no one of them has really stood out among the rest. Jonnu Smith has the strongest case, given his yardage, his targets, and his position as a tight end.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Honestly, the team&rsquo;s been a mess this entire season when it comes to field goals. The Titans started a new kicker two weeks ago in Greg Joseph. It remains to be seen whether Joseph can actually deliver, as he hasn&rsquo;t attempted a single field goal this season. His record in Cleveland is all right though, so he holds some promise.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>I would lean no here. Kevin Byard is the only defensive back from that bunch giving me pause here.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>An elite quarterback and a good offensive mind aren&rsquo;t enough to win consistently in these playoffs, let alone against the best coached team in the league in the Patriots. I expect an early death for these Titans in the Wild Card round.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Buffalo Bills</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Buffalo Bills have fought their way into the playoffs for the second time under Sean McDermott. Now let&rsquo;s review them using the rubric defined <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes, the team is mentally tough. They&rsquo;ve done enough to demonstrate a will to fight, winning almost all the games they&rsquo;re supposed to win. Their defense has hung in their in tough moments, defending leads against last-minute comeback attempts.</p>

<p>Even against tough opponents, the Bills have played well too. Baltimore and New England had to scratch and claw their way to wins over this Buffalo squad.</p>

<p>The only knock on this team and their defense is their wretched tackling. The Bills have some serious issues stopping players upon first contact.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes, the team does feature a great defensive mind in Sean McDermott. This team has lifted itself to the playoffs twice under McDermott thanks to the strength of their defense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately not. While most of the starters on offense have considerable playoff experience, this will be Josh Allen&rsquo;s first outing in the postseason. As a mediocre quarterback starting in the playoffs, things won&rsquo;t start well for these Bills.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>No. I would even struggle to say they&rsquo;re led by a viable quarterback. In reality, these Bills are led by an athlete. While Allen can run like a gazelle, he can&rsquo;t throw with any sort of grace or touch.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>To be determined. Brian Daboll has gotten some productivity out of this offense thanks to his usage of short routes, power runs behind Devin Singletary, Josh Allen&rsquo;s mobility, and good usage of mid-level veterans like John Brown and Cole Beasley. But it&rsquo;s difficult separating the logic and philosophy driving this offense from Josh Allen&rsquo;s painful throwing.</p>

<p>It seems that when this season started, the Bills were intent on having Josh Allen work with smaller receivers that could run more complicated routes. And it paid off. So if anything, that&rsquo;s an argument that demonstrates the intelligence of the coaching staff here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>At least one. I can count <strong><em>Shaq Lawson</em></strong> as an elite pass rusher here. Though not league-leading in any respect, the man still makes plays here and there, even if the numbers don&rsquo;t necessarily vouch for his ability.</p>

<p><strong><em>Jerry Hughes</em></strong> is another possibility, given the Patriots seemed intent on doubling him at the line of scrimmage. But that might have been more circumstance than actual strategy on the part of New England.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Bills hit the magic number of 3 here. I can confirm <strong><em>John Brown</em></strong>, <strong><em>Devin Singletary</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Josh Allen</em></strong> as veritable vectors. John Brown is undoubtedly the team&rsquo;s best receiver and the receiver Josh Allen favors most, going by targets. With 2 yards per route run, Brown has validated the team&rsquo;s belief in him. Devin Singletary, meanwhile, has been a great halfback, posting over 5 yards on average with every rush. And Josh Allen is on this list given his mobility - while his passing is suspect, his athleticism and his long runs are truly an asset to the offense.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cole Beasley</em></strong> falls outside this bucket here given that his production hasn&rsquo;t quite cemented him as a cornerstone on this offense. He&rsquo;s come up big in spot moments, so it was a little difficult crossing his name off here, but production and dependence matters here when assessing potential vectors.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>No. Stephen Hauschka has missed quite a few field goals this year from 50 yards and out. In fact, he missed 2 important field goals in the Bills 3-point loss to the Browns. A couple other missed field goals were attempted in end-half scenarios, creating doubts about whether he can be clutch should the Bills need a last-minute field goal to win.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Tre&rsquo; Davious White. One of the best cornerbacks in the game. Enough said.</p>

<p>Micah Hyde is another candidate here.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Bills have a number of deficiencies, most notably at quarterback and kicker. The lack of playoff experience will hurt Buffalo as well in their first match against the Texans.</p>

<p>Still, there&rsquo;s a possibility the Bills can pull off an upset against Houston in the Wild Card round. If so, their season will end in dismal fashion in Baltimore.</p>

	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Using the rubric outlined <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>, it&rsquo;s time for us to start our review of postseason teams with the sixth seed of the NFC, the Minnesota Vikings!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>No. It&rsquo;s hard for me to say this too, as I always respected Mike Zimmer and the defenses that he trains up. His defenses are usually greater than the sum of their parts. But the offense is nowhere near as resilient as the defense. With the exception of the game against the Dallas Cowboys, the Vikings offense hasn&rsquo;t surpassed expectations, nor have they really mounted any successful comebacks against solid teams.</p>

<p>Minnesota had an opportunity to step up its game against the Packers two weeks ago, but the Vikings were even more flaccid on offense than the Packers. It was depressing to see the team fail to come through on such an important game.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes, he is. There&rsquo;s no doubt that Mike Zimmer has a solid understanding of good defense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes. Most of the starters on offense have some playoff experience. Even though Kirk Cousins only has one meaningful postseason game in his career, I&rsquo;ll give him the benefit of the doubt here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>No, even though Kirk Cousins has some gaudy numbers. Those numbers came more from a play-action bootleg concept that Kevin Stefanski and Gary Kubiak incorporated into the offense midway through the season. When Kirk Cousins is forced to drop back and play quarterback without any window dressing, the man tends to fall apart.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>To be determined. As I discussed earlier when explaining why Kirk Cousins is not an elite quarterback, offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski saw some remarkable success when he incorporated a bootleg concept in the offensive playbook, allowing Kirk Cousins to roll out to his left and air out some dimes.</p>

<p>The fact that this team has been pretty productive despite not having an elite quarterback usually stands as proof that the main offensive coaches are doing a great job here, but I wonder if the Vikings&rsquo; success comes more from talent and easy competition than it does from scheme. Not to mention Minnesota remains firmly committed to the outdated mentality of power running setting everything up.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p><em>Danielle Hunter (DE)</em></p>

<p>The only pass rusher I can wholeheartedly define as elite is <strong><em>Danielle Hunter</em></strong>. I&rsquo;ve seen him step up in big moments and he has the pressure numbers and tackle numbers to justify his inclusion. <strong><em>Everson Griffen</em></strong> has those numbers as well. But it&rsquo;s different. I have yet to see Griffin truly step up and make plays on a consistent basis. I&rsquo;ll list him here simply as a possible elite pass rusher.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>I can only confirm two vectors here - <strong><em>Dalvin Cook</em></strong> and <strong><em>Stefon Diggs</em></strong>. The former remains one of the best tailbacks in this league given his penchant for manufacturing yards despite some poor run blocking from his offensive lineman. Stefon Diggs remains one of the best receiving threats in the league, having posted 2.69 yards per route run, according to Pro Football Focus.</p>

<p>It seems unfair not to include <strong><em>Adam Thielan</em></strong> on this list, but his production has plummeted off a click the past several weeks. It remains to be seen whether his injuries continuing plaguing him in the postseason.</p>

<p>Nobody else really qualifies to be on this list, which is a little worrisome. Having only two reliable vectors can leave this offense short-changed against well-coached defenses.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Yes. Outside on one bad game early in the season, Dan Bailey has done well scoring field goals and extra points for his Vikings.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Yes, Harrison Smith has made a name for himself as one of the best swiss-knife safeties in this league.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>This team should be better given its roster. But an injury to a key receiver, a lack of resilience on the part of the offense, iffy offensive coaching, a pedestrian quarterback, and complete lack of home field advantage will doom this team in their first match against the Saints.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Team Assessment Rubric</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>So in assessing these teams and figuring out which teams are more likely to perform well compared to others, I need to come up with some sort of guide that can help me compare these clubs against one another. Yes I know that any one model will fail to grasp all the finer details of the game that motivate the final result, but I do genuinely feel that a great model can be right so much more often than wrong, especially in the playoffs when seasonal data points are pretty much stable at the point. The goal here is to be predict the straight results for at least 8 of the 11 playoff games.</p>

<p>Below, I ask the following questions in <strong>order of importance</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Quite simply put, has the team showed resilience in adverse situations and still managed to play well?  Usually, this trait can be seen whenever a team has to mount a late-game comeback, especially on the road. But this trait can also manifest itself in the face of serious injury across the roster (think of the 2017 Eagles).</p>

<p>This mental fortitude usually comes from a strong head coach fostering a culture of teamwork, honesty, and discipline in the locker room.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Defenses tend to win championships. And a brilliant defensive mind will take you a long way in the playoffs, as he&rsquo;ll be able to diagnose the concepts that guide opposing offenses and structure his defenses accordingly. Few do this better than Bill Belichick.</p>

<p>A good defense is necessary if I am to designate the defensive coordinator or head coach of that team as a chess player. It sounds stupidly obvious, but it&rsquo;s worth noting nonetheless. After all, a good defensive coach should eventually produce a good defense sometime during the course of the regular season, no? However, the inverse is <strong><em>not</em></strong> true - a good defense doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to be led by a good mind. Sometimes, talent is more than enough for a defense to be good. However&hellip;talent without intelligence only leads to squandered potential, especially during the playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>In other words, I&rsquo;m talking about playoff jitters here. Sure, jitters quiet down after one game, but for that one game, nerves can determine whether a team succeeds or fails. We&rsquo;ve seen this happen time and time again, whether it was the Dallas offense starting horribly slow back in 2016, Philadelphia stumbling in its first postseason game in 2017 before rattling off two sensational wins, the Rams constantly fumbling the ball early against the Falcons in 2017, or the Jaguars embarrassing themselves with an ugly win against the lowly Bills before shredding the Steelers defense in their only postseason appearance over the last several years.</p>

<p>While the Eagles and Jaguars were able to overcome their nerves to win their respective games, the Rams and Cowboys were sunk into too deep a hole early because of their jitters.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Pretty straightforward why this is important. In today&rsquo;s pass-happy NFL, you need a quality quarterback that can be productive passing the ball, especially when schemes fail to yield easy yardage.</p>

<p>An elite quarterback is defined as a signal-caller that can throw the ball far more accurately than most other quarterbacks in the league and can still be very effective passing the ball without excessive use of schemes or gimmicks. In other words, an elite quarterback is a passer that can actually play dropback football, in which he&rsquo;s improvising throws based off whatever looks the defense gives him. To be effective at dropback football over the course of a season, one usually has to demonstrate an ability to make plays under heavy duress and against tight coverage.</p>

<p>Take the 2018 Rams and their signal caller, Jared Goff. Even though the Rams were the bad boys of the league that year on offense, Jared Goff was not an elite quarterback - the man was a product of McVay&rsquo;s system. Once that system was decoded towards the end of the season, the team saw a major dip in their production as the offense had to rely more on Jared Goff actually dropping back in the pocket, making reads, and throwing the football accurately. It wasn&rsquo;t a pretty sight, going by the Super Bowl that year.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no stat that blissfully sums this up. All the traditional quarterback stats are meaningless, given that we&rsquo;re trying to isolate quarterback performance from offensive production. The only three measures I could find that might be meaningful towards our aim here is the season-wide Expected Completion Percentage provided by Next Gen Stats, ESPN&rsquo;s proprietary Quarterback Rating, and Pro Football Focus&rsquo;s quarterback grades. The first two are limited to some extent though, especially QBR - ESPN&rsquo;s formula is still something of a black box and has been known to spit out some shady numbers from time to time. Honestly, the gold standard here is probably Pro Football Focus and their play-by-play grading on each and every quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Basically, just copy and paste the same stuff I wrote about teams needing a defensive chess players - does this team feature a great mind on offense, somebody that can scheme up great plays and create easy yardage for their offense? Pair a brilliant mind with an elite quarterback and you have a damn good combination on offense. Josh McDaniels, Frank Reich, and Andy Reid all serve as offensive geniuses on their respective teams.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m still of the belief that the edge rusher is the most important position in football outside of the quarterback, especially during the postseason. More than other positions, it&rsquo;s the edge rushers that sway critical games in their team&rsquo;s favor during the playoffs. It was the Giants and their pass rush that unraveled the seemingly immortal Patriots of 2007. The Giants repeated the same feat in 2011 thanks once again to a dominant pass rush. Hell, it could even be argued that the Patriots of 2018 won their Super Bowl in large part thanks to Trey Flowers and Kyle Van Noy wrecking offensive backfields in playoff games.</p>

<p>A pass rush will never win you the Super Bowl alone. But it certainly helps a great deal, which makes sense - defensive backs and coverage linebackers can only blanket skill players for so long before a receiver finally becomes open. An elite coverage unit is theoretically worthless if opposing quarterbacks can simply sit in the pocket and wait for one of their receivers to finally break free from coverage.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to be considered an elite pass rusher though. To get to this point, the defensive rusher needs to be able to generate pressure against opposing quarterbacks on a consistent basis. Quarterback hits are a pretty accurate metric to use here, though we should also review game tape to determine that whether a player simply feasted on weaker competition or actually managed to rack up some hits against more capable offensive linemen and quarterbacks.</p>

<p>Defensive rushers can also showcase their worth through their tackling and their effort. The best pass rushers are usually great tacklers and chasers, keeping opposing rushers from breaking past the line of scrimmage and shutting down screen plays and trick plays before they further develop.</p>

<p><em>** It&rsquo;s recommended that teams have at least 2 elite pass rushers **</em></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>By vectors, I mean all the different ways a team can move the ball on offense. When I was assessing offenses years ago, I would use the number of quality skill position players to determine whether an offense was loaded enough come time for the playoffs. But for those teams that are stacked at a particular position group, I&rsquo;d be overstating their potential. If a team had two phenomenal running backs that were being used interchangeably, it&rsquo;d be no different than having only one quality halfback on the roster. So I use the concept of vectors here to essentially normalize all the different concepts and tools a team can utilize on offense. Slot receivers, X receivers, Z receivers, tight ends, fullbacks, scatbacks, power runners, and mobile quarterbacks are all considered separate vectors on offense. Certain position groups can feature more than one vector. Take tight ends for example - a team with two great tight ends can count each of them as a separate vector, so long as both tight ends see action on the field regularly.</p>

<p>It should be obvious, but the more vectors you have, the better your offense should be. The logic is simple - the more ways an offense can move the ball, the more opposing defenses need to stretch their resources in order to try to limit that offense.</p>

<p>Notice I use the word &ldquo;reliable&rdquo; in the last sentence there. It&rsquo;s not easy for teams to develop reliable vectors. The rule of thumb here is a bit complex - it&rsquo;s not enough for a skill player to drum up yards and put up some gaudy numbers. The offense has to show some sort of dependence on that skill player, especially during key moments. It needs to be a dependance fostered through consistent success. Take Brandin Cooks back when he was with the Patriots in 2017. Sure, Cooks racked up over 1000 yards that year as a receiver, but his importance to the offense was overstated. The Patriots did just fine without him in the Super Bowl. Brady still managed roughly 500 yards against a well-coached Eagles defense. Danny Amendola was arguably much more valuable to that offense, especially given Brady prefers his receivers to run their routes between the numbers.</p>

<p>No, an offense doesn&rsquo;t need to fall apart should one of their vectors be lost to injury. But it <em>should</em> hurt. And that along is proof that a skill player qualifies as a vector.</p>

<p>When assessing a team&rsquo;s offense to determine its vectors, the traditional metrics are usually a good start. Yardage accrued, touchdowns, and targeting numbers all matter. Going beyond these standard statistics though, advanced stats like yards after the catch also help us identify the players that are creating more value by their own efforts. But the single best metric I&rsquo;ve seen is a proprietary metric from Pro Football Focus - Yards Per Route Ran. It&rsquo;s a metric that fantastically identifies the pass catchers that matter most to any particular offense. It shows us the average yardage accrued any time a pass catcher runs a meaningful route.</p>

<p>Still, the best thing here is the eye test. The eye test will tell us whether the receiver is truly creating additional value for this offense through individual effort or whether his numbers are more a result of scheme. The eye test also tells us whose names are called during critical moments.</p>

<p><em>** It&rsquo;s recommended that teams have at least 3 reliable vectors **</em></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Home field advantage may have lost some of its luster the past several years, but it still remains a valuable determinants of success in the postseason. Rarely do wild card teams see the Super Bowl - in fact, only three times in the past decade have we seen a wild card team fight their way to a championship appearance. Yes, I know teams with higher seeds tend to be better overall than teams with lower seeds, but you still can&rsquo;t discount home field advantage and the favorable refereeing that home teams tend to enjoy.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>It should be obvious why this is important. Time and time again, field goal kickers have been the difference between a loss and victory. Let&rsquo;s not forget the Super Bowls that were won and lost on a field goal attempt.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>It helps if the team has a defensive back that can essentially shut down a receiver or even make plays all across the field. Think of the Seattle Seahawks back in their heyday in the early part of the decade, where Richard Sherman was able to blanket just about any skill player in the NFL while Earl Thomas successfully patrolled the deeper end of the field as a ball hawk and last line of defense. Meanwhile, Kam Chancellor made his presence known as a violent box safety. Those three were critical to helping lift Seattle to two Super Bowl berths and one championship victory.</p>

<hr />

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. These are the questions that need to be answered positively for a team to be considered an actual Super Bowl contender. The more yeses, the higher your chance of hoisting the Lombardi trophy in the end.</p>

			<h2 id="49ers-seahawks">49ers @ Seahawks</h2>

<p>On the first drive, the 49ers defensive line won all their battles at the line of scrimmage. Arik Armstead and Nick Bosa have been impressive in particular.</p>

<p>The 49ers have some fantastic options on offense. George Kettle, Deebo Samuel, Emmanuel Sanders, Kyle Juscyzk, Raheem Mostert, and Matt Breida are all dependable vectors on offense.</p>

<p>More aggressive press coverage being played by the 49ers against these Seahawks. Impressive.</p>

<p>Some brilliant play from Russell Wilson on the Seahawks first scoring drive.</p>

<p>Arik Armstead impressing here, even though Nick Bosa is clearly the best down lineman on San Francisco.</p>

<p>Seahawks offense is doing so much better in the second half, largely because Russell Wilson is now throwing the ball to the right route-runners depending on whether the 49ers are in man coverage or zone coverage. It seems the 49ers are not really disguising their coverages too much in the second half. Once again speaks to Robert Saleh being an otherwise unremarkable defensive coach lucky to be working with so much talent.</p>

<p>DK Metcalf is truly a reliable vector on Seattle&rsquo;s offense.</p>
