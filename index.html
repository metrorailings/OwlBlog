	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - San Francisco 49ers</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The 49ers enter the postseason as the top seed. So let&rsquo;s examine their prospects using my trusty old rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Unsure. The last three weeks of the season were bizarre. One game was lost to an underwhelming Atlanta team riding the coattails of Julio Jones. The other two games were unnecessarily close. Yes, I acknowledge that key pieces of their defense were sidelined due to injury but it still doesn&rsquo;t sit well with me.</p>

<p>Then again, San Francisco did go on a rough five-week stretch in which they faced off against four playoff teams. While their record for those weeks includes two losses, those losses were hard-fought.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>No. I still contend that Robert Saleh cannot be considered an elite coach. The team&rsquo;s success on defense comes so much more from talent rather than scheme. In fact, Saleh&rsquo;s approach to defense has been notoriously failing for other teams around the league, whether in Jacksonville or Atlanta or Los Angeles or even Seattle.</p>

<p>On top of that, the Arizona Cardinals managed to ring up points against this defense in two (almost) back-to-back meetings, even though their scheme on offense is pretty obviously configured to favor short passes.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>No. Jimmy Garoppalo lacks meaningful playoff experience. Likewise, Deebo Samuel and George Kittle, two of the most valuable skill players, lack postseason experience.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>No. The passing offense on this team has seen some great success courtesy of scheme and raw talent instead of quarterback competence. Credit due to Garoppolo though - he&rsquo;s been excellent in his direction of Kyle Shanahan&rsquo;s system. So was Matt Ryan the year the Falcons went to the Super Bowl with Shanahan at offensive coordinator - Ryan&rsquo;s play was taken to whole another level. I feel the same applies here as well, in that Garoppalo&rsquo;s numbers have been inflated thanks to a system that prides itself on misdirection and unpredictability. While Jimmy has shined in his execution of this system, he hasn&rsquo;t even come close to matching the same success Ryan had running these same concepts.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Without a doubt. Kyle Shanahan has whipped this offense into something magical. Only Baltimore has a scarier offense, to be honest.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h2>

<p><strong><em>Nick Bosa</em></strong> is this team&rsquo;s premiere pass-rusher.</p>

<p>After him, <strong><em>Arik Armstead</em></strong> presents a strong case here, given his numbers alone. Past the numbers, I&rsquo;ve observed Armstead constantly making plays throughout the season, justifying his designation here as an elite pass rusher.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dee Ford</em></strong> is potentially another name worth adding to this list, though things remain uncertain given his complicated injury history this season.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The team&rsquo;s single best weapon on offense is its tight end, <strong><em>George Kittle.</em></strong> George Kittle&rsquo;s numbers alone sell his case as the team&rsquo;s biggest offensive threat. <strong><em>Deebo Samuel</em></strong> and <strong><em>Emmanual Sanders</em></strong> are other receivers that can be noted as vectors here, especially the former given his ability to run like Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>

<p>When it comes to their offensive backfield, the 49ers have two additional vectors - the fullback <strong><em>Kyle Juszczyk</em></strong> and their committee of tailbacks (<strong><em>Raheem Mostert / Tevin Coleman / Matt Breida</em></strong>). Juszczyk&rsquo;s numbers don&rsquo;t necessarily justify his designation as a vector, but the man&rsquo;s ability to catch the ball out of the backfield is especially valuable for an offense looking to exhaust defenses and their limited coverage resources.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, all through the NFC playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p><em>Arguably</em> yes. Aside from a bad game in which Gould shanked two kicks and had one blocked and another game that was played in some horrific weather, Gould has been pretty good. Maybe I&rsquo;m making too many excuses for him here, but I&rsquo;ll give him the benefit of the doubt given his history.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Richard Sherman has been one of the best cornerbacks in the league this year, so yes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The 49ers are missing the services of a brilliant defensive mind and a quarterback that can play his way out of negative game script. Not to mention their lack of experience will hurt them as well against the Vikings. Even though I&rsquo;ve been pretty damn awful at predicting postseason outcomes so far in these write-ups, I&rsquo;ll continue doing so because I&rsquo;m a dumb fuck - I do think the Vikings will upset the 49ers here.</p>

			<p>This shit just don&rsquo;t make no sense. It really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-patriots">Titans @ Patriots</h2>

<p>It seems Tennessee&rsquo;s success on defense came mostly against short-yardage situations and trick plays. The Titans knew the Patriots playbook on those plays - Vrabel leveraged the knowledge he had of New England&rsquo;s habits in these scenarios. Perhaps it&rsquo;s no wonder that Belichick has such a poor record against his assistant coaches compared to his overall record - these coaches know his habits and thought process and know the proper plays to counter them.</p>

<p>If I knew this better, I would have classified the Titans as defensively chess-minded for this game. And that designation would have been enough for me to think twice about taking a side on this game.</p>

<p>And I will never understand why the Patriots were so intent on shutting down the Titans air game early on, despite Ryan Tannehill having a documented history of failure at Gillette Stadium. Derrick Henry is the heart and soul of the offense too - shutting him down early would have forced the Titans to play out of their groove. Steve and Bill Belichick have disappointed me.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-saints">Vikings @ Saints</h2>

<p>It seems evident to me that the Saints phoned this game in. Even though pound-for-pound the Saints are the better team, New Orleans was not fully committed to winning this game, instead possibly looking ahead to the Packers or even the 49ers.</p>

<p>Tackling was poor. The pass rush was nonexistent. Will Lutz missed a kick. Offensive linemen were losing their battles in the trenches. Only Trey Hendricksen and and Taysom Hill seem to have shown up here.</p>

<p>Kevin Stefanski needs to be given credit here though for his playcalling. His plays have made some excellent use of pre-snap motion to throw this Saints defense off their scent. The Vikings also used the Saints initial reads against them on occasion with some great success.</p>

<p>Drew Brees is not an elite quarterback. His arm strength has waned with age. Even if the mind and improvisational skill is there, the physical tools are limited.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Kirk Cousins is playing fairly decent. While his accuracy has presented issues on a few occasions, he&rsquo;s been all right. His ability to pass and roll out to the left has held up excellently into the postseason.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - New Orleans Saints</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Saints are oddly only the 3rd seed in the NFC due to some unfortunate luck when Drew Brees injured his thumb against the Rams and an underprepared Teddy Bridgewater had to step into his place. Even still, New Orleans has been billed as one of the favorites to win. Let&rsquo;s use the  the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a> to see exactly why.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>No doubt. Winning five straight games without Drew Brees alone proves the team can handle hardship. Their comeback win against a surging Titans team in Tennessee is another fine example that exemplifies this team&rsquo;s mental fortitude.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Dennis Allen&rsquo;s tenure as the Saints defensive coach has been largely successful. This year is no different. All three levels of his defense have impressed in one way or another.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes, these Saints have become fixtures in the playoffs, going three years now with postseason outings.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes. Brees continues to break passing records in this league. And unlike last year, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like any nagging injury will be sapping him of his talent.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Sean Payton&rsquo;s a fantastic coach and an even better offensive mind. His ability to scheme up quick passes for Drew Brees has allowed this offense to consistently move the chains on first and second downs instead of third down.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Cameron Jordan</em></strong> can safely be considered an elite pass rusher, given his numbers alone and consistency in production.</p>

<p>While Marcus Davenport, the Saints other starting edge rusher, has been relegated to injured reserve for the season, New Orleans might actually have another man that can step up and pressure the passer on a consistent basis - <strong><em>Demario Davis</em></strong>. Even though Davis has been limited in the number of times he&rsquo;s allowed to rush into the offensive backfield, he&rsquo;s been surprisingly efficient when doing so as of lately. Over the past six weeks, he&rsquo;s tallied up six hits on opposing quarterbacks over 73 rushes. Not too shabby for a middle linebacker.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Saints have at least four different vectors on offense.</p>

<p>The most important one is is <strong><em>Michael Thomas</em></strong>, who earned his billing as the best wide receiver in the NFL this season.</p>

<p><strong><em>Alvin Kamara</em></strong> has still been playing at a high level, even if his numbers are not as impressive as in years past.</p>

<p>The Saints&rsquo; investment in <strong><em>Jared Cook</em></strong> this offseason has paid off in spades, as Drew Brees has found himself a tight end that can run routes along the middle of the field and make tough catches when necessary. In one year, he&rsquo;s become a vital part of the offense, posting over two yards per route run, according to Pro Football Focus.</p>

<p>Lastly, <strong><em>Taysom Hill</em></strong> continues to serve the team well as a utility player who can run all sorts of plays from the quarterback position given his athleticism.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only during the Wild Card round, most likely.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Yes. Will Lutz has been solid this year outside of one bad game against the Bears. I&rsquo;m not sure if the Soldier Field turf played a role in that game though. Either way, his selection to the Pro Bowl this year justifies his consideration as a reliable field goal kicker.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Yes, Marshon Lattimore qualifies here, given his reputation as a shutdown corner.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Saints hold so much promise this year. Though without a bye and real home-field advantage, the Saints still stand as Super Bowl favorites in my book.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Houston Texans</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Texans have limped into the playoffs as the fourth seed in the AFC. Let&rsquo;s use the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a> to see if they can go far in the postseason.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Not sure. The Texans have been great at staging late-game comebacks, even on the road. But Houston is such a bipolar team - it seems every good performance is followed by a bad showing. Great showings against the likes of the Chiefs, Patriots, Saints, and Titans have been accompanied by sad displays against the Jaguars, Broncos, Raiders, and Buccaneers.</p>

<p>It seems this team phones in performances whenever they&rsquo;re significant favorites, similar to the championship Giants of 2011. Except those Giants went through a gauntlet of playoff-caliber teams midway through the season that really helped them adjust mentally to a difficult postseason. The Texans haven&rsquo;t gone through a murderer&rsquo;s row of games this season.</p>

<p>Houston did go through some hardships this season when they lost JJ Watt for half the season. While none of its other pass rushers have stepped up in Watt&rsquo;s absence, the Texans defense were able to compensate with some strong performances from the revamped defensive backfield.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll say yes here though, going off Bill O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s past history.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue yes. Romeo Crennel&rsquo;s willingness to experiment with the blitz and incorporate cast-offs into his defensive backfield says something about his drive to make this defense better. The defense also had a few stellar games this year, most notably against the Patriots in a big prime-time spot and the Jaguars over in London.</p>

<p>One thing does give me pause here - the way the defense has choked away yardage this year compared to years past. It&rsquo;s just not the same defense - this team has been too happy giving up yardage. Then again, maybe Houston can&rsquo;t help itself in this area given the impotence of the pass rush following JJ Watt&rsquo;s chest injury.</p>

<p>Either way, I&rsquo;ll give the benefit of the doubt to Romeo Crennel once again going off history.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes, they do.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Without a doubt. Lamar Jackson aside, Deshaun Watson has been the most electric quarterback this season. The Texans are never out of contention so long as Watson is leading this offense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>No. I see Bill O&rsquo;Brien has more of an appetite this season for experimentation and change, but he still baffles me with his insistence on running offensive concepts that&rsquo;ve been failing more often than not. His blind devotion to inside zone runs and his poor play-action scheming are good examples of concepts that are featured prominently in the playbook even if they haven&rsquo;t proven themselves over long stretches.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>Only one - <strong><em>JJ Watt</em></strong>. As Rivers McCown has noted time and time again in his articles about the Texans this year, nobody else on Houston has stepped up in Watt&rsquo;s absense. Jacob Martin and Whitney Mercilus have shown flashes of brilliance, but neither have been consistent.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Texans feature four different vectors here. Their top receiver is <strong><em>DeAndre Hopkins</em></strong>. His AP All-Pro designation this year speaks for itself. <strong><em>Will Fuller</em></strong> also counts as a vector, given his role as the team&rsquo;s main deep threat. Even though Fuller is a basket case when it comes to injury, his presence on offense makes a serious difference - statistical downturns have been documented when Fuller is missing in action. Even though Fuller will be sidelined for the Wild Card game, I&rsquo;m still counting him as a vector as he may be a factor in the games going forward.</p>

<p>When it comes to the ground game, the Texans are pretty productive with the combo of <strong><em>Carlos Hyde</em></strong> and <strong><em>Duke Johnson</em></strong>. Duke Johnson provides more versatility in the passing game whereas Carlos Hyde has been a workhorse, rushing the ball for over 1000 yards on 245 rushes.  And we can&rsquo;t forget about <strong><em>Deshaun Watson</em></strong> and his ability to scramble as well. In fact, the success of their ground game can be partly traced to teams having to honor Watson&rsquo;s ability to run with the ball.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Not sure. Ka&rsquo;imi Fairbairn seems given to streaks. Not to mention his misses tend to come on the road, which may be an indictment on his composure. He&rsquo;s been absolutely perfect the last six games though (two of which were on the road), so he&rsquo;s on the right track.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give the Texans the benefit of the doubt here and say Fairbairn is reliable enough.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>No. No one defensive back on this team has stood out in my observations on this team.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>While a win over the Bills seems likely, their road to the playoffs will end with a tough loss to Baltimore.</p>

			<h2 id="bills-texans-2-5">Bills @ Texans (-2.5)</h2>

<p>The Texans have the experience and the quarterback while the Bills have the better defense overall and the grit. It&rsquo;s a fair spread, to be honest. I&rsquo;d give the edge to the Texans given it is their home field.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you this though - Josh Allen&rsquo;s inexperience in the playoffs and his mediocre play gives us another opportunity here to bet in favor of the Texans in the 1st half.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bet: Texans 1st Half ML</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-patriots-5">Titans @ Patriots (-5)</h2>

<p>Yes, the Titans have been playing phenomenally with Ryan Tannehill at the helm. But the Titans may have the worst defense this year compared to all the other postseason teams. That and Ryan Tannehill lacks serious playoff experience, making things even more stressful on a Tennessee offense that will be asked to carry the bulk of the workload here in their games.</p>

<p>The Patriots offense has been pretty pathetic this year, but all the other aspects of their team are solid. Their coaches still remain the best in the league as well. Add in home field advantage and you have the recipe for a beatdown here.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Philadelphia Eagles</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Eagles have managed to win the NFC East after so much drama. Let&rsquo;s see if they can actually survive a game or two though. We&rsquo;ll evaluate them using the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes. It&rsquo;s been painful watching the Eagles this year, but these past few weeks have shown me Philadelphia has demonstrated enough resilience and grit to be considered mentally tough. It takes some fortitude to survive games the past two weeks while so many people on your roster are going down like flies. So I will give them kudos here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Jim Schwartz has always been one of the better defensive minds in the business. Nothing has changed this year to indicate otherwise. In fact, the team&rsquo;s success this year is more attributable to Schwartz than anybody else this year. Despite injuries wrecking his secondary for a bunch of games and his defensive line underperforming on a few occasions, Schwartz has kept his unit playing at a high level. Constant reorganizations were managed well throughout the season, as depth players were prepared to step up and play serviceably enough in relief duty.</p>

<p>Nothing better demonstrates Schwartz&rsquo;s aptitude than the way the defense played against the Cowboys in the division championship. Yes, Dak was injured somewhat, but the defensive backfield played very well in coverage, batting away balls and keeping the Cowboys receiving threats under wraps for the most part. It was a surprising showing from a unit many people assumed would be the weakest part of their defense. Schwartz deserves credit for training his defensive backs well.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately not. While the offensive line has plenty of playoff experience, Carson Wentz and a few of key skill players will be officially playing in their first playoff game. How quick Wentz will be able to calm his nerves will largely determine their final destination in the playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually the most difficult question to answer. Wentz has shown his mettle at times, leading at least five drives to outright win games or maintain leads. He should be credited for a game-winning drive against the Falcons as well, but his receiver dropped the ball at a crucial moment unfortunately.</p>

<p>Still, he&rsquo;s had a number of dull performances. This Eagles offense almost seemed rudderless at times with him at its helm. Even some games that he won were far more harrowing than they needed to be - some of those comebacks shouldn&rsquo;t have been needed in the first place. Injuries and bad coaching have played a role, but the quarterback has to assume some responsibility as well.  His negative expected completion rate isn&rsquo;t doing him any favors.</p>

<p>Because of these doubts, I can&rsquo;t classify him as an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>No. While the Eagles can coach up players, I question their play-calling their times. Their commitment to the ground game borders on obstinacy at times, though the rushing attack has won them two games.</p>

<p>What really worries me is that the Eagles possess far more talent on offense than so many other teams and yet I see too many drives stopped short. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me, especially with a capable quarterback like Carson Wentz at the helm of the offense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know. We have three eligible candidates here - <strong><em>Derek Barnett</em></strong>, <strong><em>Fletcher Cox</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Brandon Graham</em></strong>. Neither one have truly stood out consistently enough from my observations. In the key rematch against the Dallas Cowboys, neither of the three were able to mount much pressure, though Derek Barnett may have been playing hurt. Against the Giants in the last week of the regular season, all three had a moment, but I didn&rsquo;t see enough consistency.</p>

<p>Their numbers aren&rsquo;t very impressive as well, though it may be more a function</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s very likely to me that at least one of the three stands out during the postseason. And it&rsquo;s quite possible another of the group will rise up.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Eagles actually have five different vectors on offense.</p>

<p>The most important vectors are the tight ends - <strong><em>Zach Ertz</em></strong> and  <strong><em>Dallas Goedert</em></strong>. Both have the ability to run routes and make tough catches. And Carson Wentz seems to have an affinity for his tight ends, given his targeting numbers.</p>

<p>On the receiver end, we have <strong><em>Greg Ward</em></strong> as a surprise breakout star now that the offense can no longer count on the services of Alshon Jeffery nor DeSean Jackson. On the rushing end, <strong><em>Miles Sanders</em></strong> has done a fantastic job as a rookie tailback, working in concert with a solid offensive line. His ability to catch the balls out of the backfield also serves this team well.</p>

<p>One more vector here is <strong><em>Carson Wentz</em></strong>. Though his passing may be shaky at times, his ability to scramble can sustain drives when plays don&rsquo;t develop as expected.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>No. Jake Elliott has not been so clutch over the past several weeks, missing four field goals, three of which would have helped to end the game sooner in the Eagles favor.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Malcolm Jenkins definitely ranks as an elite player.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Eagles have their fair share of strengths and weaknesses. If Carson Wentz can play past his inexperience and connect well with his weapons on offense, a division round invitation is in order. And while the Eagles will not be the favorite up against the 49ers, I do believe they&rsquo;ll give San Francisco a run for their money.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Seattle Seahawks</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Seahawks are returning to the playoffs once again as a wild card team. Let&rsquo;s see if their fortunes will be better this year using my lovely little rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes. Once again returning to this idea that mental fortitude is primarily a function of the head coach, I&rsquo;d be remiss to doubt Pete Carroll and the attitude that he instills in his team.</p>

<p>Granted, the team has fallen short on a few occasions or even nearly coughed up the lead in other games, but the Hawks still have that resilience, probably best exemplified by their near-successful comeback against the 49ers in the season finale, despite being so utterly outplayed and out-coached.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, no. Even though Carroll once led the Legion of Boom early in the decade, his grasp on defensive concepts seems to have slipped over the years.</p>

<p>The Seahawks have coughed up nearly 6000 yards on defense this year. They&rsquo;ve won games sloppily against teams that ate up yardage against their defense. Matt Schaub managed to post 460 yards against their defense, albeit in a futile effort as the game was out of hand.</p>

<p>People can argue that Carroll&rsquo;s defenses are more than happy to give up yardage when the Seahawks are blowing out the other team on the scoreboard. Sure, but the Seahawks back in their Legion of Boom days were infamously stingy, even with big leads.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes. With the exception of a few rookies, most of the Seahawks have considerable playoff experience, including Russell Wilson.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes. Russell Wilson was in the conversation for MVP before Lamar Jackson really broke out as the favorite. Still, he&rsquo;s put in some remarkable performances, including a nearly legendary comeback against the 49ers that fell short due to bad coaching.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Once again, no. The offense can be unbearably flaccid at times and all too content playing some uninspiring football with the lead in hand. Brian Schottenheimer has done little to field an efficient and creative offense, despite having one of the best quarterbacks in the game heading his offense. Even in their pivotal game against the 49ers, the Seahawks were gutless on offense until the game was essentially forced into Russell Wilson&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>None. Jadaveon Clowney may be the one person on this team closest to being considered elite, but his boom-or-bust production over the course of the season only invalidates such a consideration - an elite pass rusher needs to rack up pressures and tackles and be <strong><em>consistent</em></strong> at it.</p>

<p>Nobody else even comes close.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Tyler Lockett</em></strong> and <strong><em>D.K. Metcalf</em></strong> are the only skill players that can be safely considered reliable vectors on offense, the former known for his speed and route-running ability while the latter is known more as a receiver that can make those contested catches outside the number. Chris Carson would have been on this list had his season not ended due to a hip injury.</p>

<p><strong><em>Russell Wilson</em></strong> can add himself to this list as well given his ability to run the ball, either off read-options or scrambles.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>No. Jason Myers has missed one too many kicks in critical moments for me to certify him as a reliable field goal kicker. Not to mention he&rsquo;s shanked a few extra point attempts.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>No. The Seahawks have one of the worst backfields in the league, as no one player has stood out from those ranks.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Seahawks have too many deficiencies to go far. With a little bit of luck, Seattle can advance to the division round and possibly lose a closer-than-expected race against the 49ers, but it seems more probable to me that the Hawks will be downed by their fellow birds of prey in the Eagles.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - New England Patriots</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Patriots are seeing Wild Card weekend for the first time in over ten years, shockingly. So let&rsquo;s examine their prospects using my trusty old rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>One would think so going solely off history. But in reality, this team shouldn&rsquo;t have lost the way it did against the Dolphins last week. It was an embarrassing loss against a double-digit underdog.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure anymore. The Patriots have lost three of their last five games. Two of those losses came back-to-back. The will to win is there, but the talent and execution is not. Brady, McDaniels, and Belichick have known about this team&rsquo;s offensive issues since the beginning of the season and yet, these three seem almost powerless to overcome them.</p>

<p>Still, mental toughness is usually a function of the head coach, and it&rsquo;s impossible for me to doubt Bill Belichick given his pedigree. So I&rsquo;ll give the Patriots the benefit of the doubt here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes, Bill Belichick is still one of the best at coaching defenses, let alone teams. His defense this year has been the gold standard at pass coverage.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>No doubt.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yet another question difficult to answer. Brady has underthrown quite a few passes this year. He&rsquo;s unable to develop much rapport with his young receiving corps. Some of the touch on his throws must be lost, as he&rsquo;s not really attempting tight-window throws anymore.</p>

<p>But the mind is still there. The raw football intelligence is still there. It&rsquo;s a quality that never truly leaves the greats, that genius level of knowledge about a particular subject that renders itself indelibly into the recesses of their minds.</p>

<p>Still&hellip;the very fact I have doubt here is enough for me to say no, Brady is no longer an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Josh McDaniels is one of the better offensive minds in the league today. The Patriots have made hay using scheming and trick plays to put points on the board. Were it not for these plays being so cleverly scripted into the flow of the game, New England&rsquo;s offense would be abysmal instead of just miserable.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Kyle Van Noy</em></strong> can definitely be considered an elite pass rusher, given his consistently solid play over the course of the season. While his pass rushing numbers aren&rsquo;t as gaudy as one would expect, we have to keep in mind that Belichick defenses typically ask a great deal more from their pass rushers - Kyle Van Noy saw quite a bit of coverage work throughout the season that took away some of his pass rushing opportunities.</p>

<p>And really, if Van Noy is on this list despite the lack of spectacular statistics, then one could make a very strong argument for <strong><em>Dont&rsquo;a Hightower</em></strong>.  Hightower was actually more productive on a per-rush basis, tallying up at least 13 quarterback hits despite rushing only half as often as Van Noy.</p>

<p>Somebody could make an argument for <strong><em>Jamie Collins</em></strong> as well, but I&rsquo;ll shy away from that as it&rsquo;s quite clear Bill prefers to use Collins far more in coverage than as an actual pass rusher.</p>

<p>Still, we have two confirmed elite pass rushers and one man that can play like a stud rusher depending on the game plan. The Patriots are in good shape here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>On the other hand, the Patriots are not in so good a shape here. <strong><em>Julian Edelman</em></strong> is clearly a vector given the trust Brady has vested in him, but Edelman&rsquo;s inclusion as a vector is only meaningful so long as he remains healthy <em>enough</em> over the course of the postseason. Injuries have hammered him repeatedly through the season and it seems as if things will be no different for the playoffs.</p>

<p><strong><em>James White</em></strong> is the only other player that I can confidently assert as a vector here, given his ability to catch balls out of the backfield.</p>

<p>I have a hard time considering <strong><em>Sony &ldquo;Playstation&rdquo; Michel</em></strong> and <strong><em>Rex Burkhead</em></strong> a vector here as the Patriots offensive line have been pretty flaccid in their run-blocking. Though it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Patriots have been so much better running the ball the past three weeks, so we can&rsquo;t completely rule out the ground game as a possible vector. More footage needs to be put on tape before I correct myself here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Surprisingly, yes. Despite their struggles over the season with field goals, it seems the Patriots finally found somebody that can kick them through the uprights consistently. Folk only missed three field goals all year, two in inclement weather and one that was blocked when the Patriots line broke down inside.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Stephon Gilmore. One could also include Devin McCourty with his five interceptions.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Patriots are not nearly as bad as the media narratives claim. Still, their limp offense will cost them dearly on the road in Kansas City.</p>
