			<h2 id="bears-lions">Bears @ Lions</h2>

<p>The Lions suck. Just something worth noting.</p>

<p>The Bears seem to suck more though. This new quarterback Brough is actually stepping up and making good plays in Chicago&rsquo;s loose zone coverage. Did the Bears&rsquo; defensive backfield come into this match not giving a shit?</p>

<p>The Lions suck, particularly up front. Their pass rush is virtually nonexistant. Despite the Lions&rsquo; hot start, the Bears have posted more yards on offense.</p>

<p>Detroit may be worse than the Giants at defense. I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-cowboys">Bills @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>The Bills have gotten a beat on this Cowboys passing offense. Though once again, the defense has been showing a vulnerability against the run.</p>

<p>The Cowboys&rsquo; offensive front has been a little overwhelmed today, likely because of carefully planned blitzes.</p>

			<h2 id="giants-bears">Giants @ Bears</h2>

<p>Trubisky plays much better in a high-tempo offense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-patriots">Cowboys @ Patriots</h2>

<p>The Patriots will need to commit more to running the ball, as their passing game is still a mess when throws are not schemed.</p>

<p>Cowboys have seen some success running the ball. Nothing too consistent, but it seems like something that&rsquo;ll help them string a few plays together on a scoring drive.</p>

<p>These Cowgirls aren&rsquo;t equipped to play in wet and windy conditions. Their special teams also may present a serious liability.</p>

<p>Patriots pass protection has held up remarkably well now that Isaiah Wynn has been inserted back into the lineup.</p>

<p>A promising New England drive was stopped when Demarcus Lawrence and Michael Bennett finally stepped up and killed two run plays.</p>

<p>The Cowboys may have the worst special teams in the league. New England is exposing this unit as a joke.</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy may be the Patriots&rsquo; best pass rusher. I&rsquo;m waiting to see Jamie Collins really make his presence felt. But it&rsquo;s interesting that New England&rsquo;s best pass rushers are not necessarily people that specialize in trench warfare to begin with. Instead, New England seems more inclined to stationing more agile linebackers along the edges of their defensive front.. It&rsquo;s probably the reason why the team decided to jettison Michael Bennett earlier in the season.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="dolphins-browns">Dolphins @ Browns</h2>

<p>A gift of a pass interference call sustained a Browns touchdown drive.</p>

<p>Dolphins doing well limiting Nick Chubb&rsquo;s gains.</p>

<p>Is Miami seriously trying to play New England&rsquo;s style of defense without having any of the horses in the defensive backfield?</p>

<p>The Dolphins are just so bad running the ball. Just so bad.</p>

<p>Negative game script is not something the Dolphins tolerate well.</p>

<p>Just horrific coaching by Miami. The Dolphins tried to run a special teams trick play from several yards out by running the ball. This team isn&rsquo;t trying very hard to prepare.</p>

<p>Jarvis Landry emerging as the Browns&rsquo; best weapon on offense.</p>

<p>The Dolphins&rsquo; revamped pass coverage unit is not coping well with all the different weapons the Browns field on offense. That may be the critical difference in this game.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-49ers">Packers @ 49ers</h2>

<p>The 49ers have a pretty dominant defensive line, if that hasn&rsquo;t been emphasized enough before. Arik Armstead now wreaking havoc in the backfield when he lines up as an edge rusher.</p>

<p>The Packers lack diversity and creativity in their offensive playbook. Unlike Arizona last week, the Packers are not taking advantage of the 49ers&rsquo; tendency on defense to keep their cornerbacks off the receivers. Green Bay&rsquo;s offense should be dinking and dunking their way to points here. Instead, Rodgers is insisting on holding the ball here instead of simply taking what the defense is giving him.</p>

<p>Slants and digs are ripping apart this Green Bay coverage unit.</p>

<p>Cris Collinsworth is a goddamn moron sometimes.</p>

<p>Fred Warner stepping up nicely as the middle linebacker now that Kwon Alexander is out for the season.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Kyle Shanahan is calling the offense aggressively despite being up by multiple touchdowns. Interesting.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="buccaneers-falcons">Buccaneers @ Falcons</h2>

<p>Fuck me&hellip;I just realized that I picked the Falcons here largely because Atlanta is usually so well prepared against its division rivals. With this Tampa team under a new coaching regime, any intel the Falcons gathered before on Tampa Bay may have been rendered mostly moot. My assumption was invalid.</p>

<p>Tampa&rsquo;s run defense is for real.</p>

<p>Jameis throwing a perfect ball on a timing route for a touchdown.</p>

<p>Shaquil Barrett not falling for any of the Falcons&rsquo; play-action.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay starting this game with a number of miscues. A drop by their star wide receiver and two interceptions from Jameis.</p>

<p>The Buccaneers don&rsquo;t seem to care for any of Atlanta&rsquo;s play-action fakes.</p>

<p>Chris Godwin having an unreal game today, even catching Jameis Winston&rsquo;s errant passes.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay&rsquo;s defensive front is dominating this Falcons offensive line in the pass game.</p>

<p>Jameis Winston having a little bit too easy of a time connecting on deep passes against this Falcons zone coverage. Seems to me that while Atlanta seems to be blanketing Mike Evans with multiple defensive backs, Chris Godwin and other receivers are more or less being released into vanilla zones that are pretty easy to exploit.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="panthers-saints">Panthers @ Saints</h2>

<p>Panthers run defense is worrisome. Eight men in the box against a very heavy formation and Latavius Murray still ran in the touchdown.</p>

<p>Brees showing so much more of a willingness to throw the ball.</p>

<p>The Saints dominating without arguably their best player on offense in Alvin Kamara is noteworthy.</p>

<p>This Panthers defense is a sieve, at least up until opposing offenses make their way into the red zone.</p>

<p>Carolina Panthers making some hay using end-arounds and misdirection plays.</p>

<p>Carolina&rsquo;s offensive line blocking is suspect.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ravens-rams">Ravens @ Rams</h2>

<p>The Rams edge defenders are having a really hard time containing runs that veer to the outside. These Raven halfbacks are gashing the Rams defense on the outside. Not to mention Rams defenders are playing nowhere near as physical as this Ravens offense right now.</p>

			<h4 id="broncos-bills-4">Broncos @ <em>Bills</em> (-4)</h4>

<p>A bit of a risky pick given that the Broncos can run the ball behind Philip Lindsay and the offensive coaching staff has shown a penchant for trickery, but this Bills defense is overall much better than a Broncos offense led by a quarterback that has yet to show he can play dropback football.</p>

<p>Plus the injuries along the Broncos offensive line should present pass-rushing opportunities for this Bills front seven.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> The game went as expected, more or less. The Bills defense exposed Brandon Allen as a sham.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="lions-redskins-3-5"><em>Lions</em> @ Redskins (+3.5)</h4>

<p>I still have absolutely zero faith in an entitled Dwayne Haskins and a Redskins team mired in a toxic environment.</p>

<p>That and Jeff Driskel impressed me in his outing against the Dallas. He was fearless with his passes, almost to the point of recklessness. Driskel is not afraid to chance those big plays. Even if the Lions are without the services of their best pass rusher in Trey Flowers, does it really take much to throw Haskins off his game, especially considering his reputed aversion to throwing in tight windows.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> I forgot how pathetic these Lions can be. As Brandon Allen demonstrated, one good game is too little a sample size to judge a quarterback, especially when that quarterback doesn&rsquo;t have much of a rushing attack or defense that can bail him out of bad decisions.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="dolphins-browns-10-5"><em>Dolphins</em> @ Browns (-10.5)</h4>

<p>I cannot trust these Browns as double-digit favorites against anybody, even the worst team in football. And missing the only three players on this team that can rush the passer should give Tannehill and his skill players enough opportunities to post points on the board. I don&rsquo;t expect the Dolphins to win, but I do expect Miami to score just enough to keep the game within two scores.</p>

<p>Besides, even if the Dolphins stall on offense, hopefully they can be bailed out by penalties that the Browns love committing.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> Well, Ryan Fitzpatrick almost managed to come back and cover in this one, but alas&hellip;it was not meant to be. The Dolphins makeshift defensive backfield could not contain all the skill players the Browns fielded. That was the fundamental difference in this game.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="buccaneers-falcons-4-5">Buccaneers @ <em>Falcons</em> (-4.5)</h4>

<p>Once again, the Falcons played incredibly well against another division opponent last week in the Panthers. Why expect anything different from a Tampa Bay team that&rsquo;s been drastically underperforming this season? Not to mention that Atlanta&rsquo;s recently revived pass rush should force Jameis Winston into a few errors.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> Maybe the Falcons doing well against division opponents the last two years was more noise than actual meaningful data from which we can extrapolate future performances. Or maybe Dan Quinn and his staff might have been a tad too unfamiliar with Tampa Bay&rsquo;s new coaching regime to properly plan around their tendencies on offense and defense.</p>

<p>Either way, Atlanta was never completely out of contention here until the second half. Despite that, it wasn&rsquo;t a pretty day or the Falcons offense - Matt Ryan was under duress on every drive. The Buccaneers defensive front consistently won their battles in the trenches. Furthermore, Ryan himself was noticeably more off than I expected - maybe a sign of old age rearing its ugly form here? Not too sure, but questions persist as to whether Ryan is still one of the league&rsquo;s better quarterbacks. The legitimacy of these questions makes Atlanta&rsquo;s offensive line issues all the more worrisome.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="jaguars-titans-3">Jaguars @ <em>Titans</em> (-3)</h4>

<p>The Titans are seen on the same level as the Jaguars according to the sportsbooks and I am not sure why. Yes, the Jaguars were able to pull out a great win when these two teams battled earlier in the season, but that victory was partly fueled by Jaguars players playing past their pay grade thanks to an emotional high due to the sudden emergence of sixth-round rookie Gardner Minshew. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the Jaguars were held in check for much of the game. It was a few big passes to receivers running outside the numbers that was the key difference.</p>

<p>Besides, the Jaguars run defense has been exposed over the past couple weeks. The Titans want nothing more than to run the ball at will, so this weakness plays well into Tennessee&rsquo;s strength here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> Went just as expected. The Titans dominated the Jaguars with both power runs and intermediate passes off play-action.</p>

			<h2 id="texans-ravens">Texans @ Ravens</h2>

<p>Matthew Judon dominating against the run and at taking down the quarterback.</p>

<p>Deshaun Watson seems to be leaning too heavily on DeAndre Hopkins in the passing game. Lots of slants and even a deep heave in his direction on a critical 4th down play.</p>

<p>Ravens&rsquo; defensive line has been a little sloppy with their aggressiveness. One bad penalty sustained an ultimately fruitless Texans drive.</p>

<p>Houston&rsquo;s pass rush is nonexistent, as expected. Mercilus, Reader, nor Brennan Scarlet.</p>

<p>The Ravens and their cadre of tight ends are unique in this league. Mark Andrews catching a touchdown pass against a cornerback demonstrates his value as a pass catcher.</p>

<p>Lamar Jackson and his ability to break tackles is really something special. His patience with the ball also impresses me.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-buccaneers">Saints @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Once again, Brees and Thomas haven&rsquo;t missed a beat with their connection whenever the latter runs flat routes.</p>

<p>A bungled snap from Jameis nearly cost the Buccaneers a possession one yard away from the end zone. Luckily, the sack created additional space for the Tampa Bay offense that allowed Jameis to slide the ball towards a halfback running a post route against a linebacker for a touchdown.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting studying this game to see if the Saints can work out of negative game script given Brees and his penchant for the short ball. So far, one drive ended because of a negative play.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-lions">Cowboys @ Lions</h2>

<p>Jeff Driskel is one hell of a mobile quarterback himself. Not like Lamar Jackson, but still pretty good in his own right.</p>

<p>Driskel&rsquo;s decision-making is suspect. Opted to throw the ball instead of running for what might have been a first-down.</p>

<p>Detroit&rsquo;s defense is just not physical enough compared to this Dallas offense. Jason Witten caught a ball against a defensive back in his hip pocket. Amari Cooper made a catch against a pass that should have been picked off by Darius Slay. Blitzes are just not hitting home. Dak Prescott is breaking out of sacks long enough to throw completions.</p>

<p>Detroit rushing only 3 people on a critical 3rd down is just pathetic. Matt Patricia thinks way too highly of his coverage people.</p>

<p>Dallas is trying to close out this game on an aggressive note, interestingly enough. Dak is handling the ball much more than Zeke.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="patriots-eagles">Patriots @ Eagles</h2>

<p>Dallas Goedert stepping on a big screen.</p>

<p>Philadelphia&rsquo;s secondary is holding up well against the Patriots receiving corps now that they&rsquo;re healthy.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="broncos-vikings">Broncos @ Vikings</h2>

<p>Denver coming out with a creative offensive concept on a shovel sweep.</p>

<p>Courtland Sutton is the man.</p>

<p>Broncos showing confidence in Brandon Allen, having him throw 3 straight times on a goal-to-go situation.</p>

<p>Some fantastically creative play-calling from the Broncos offensive coaching staff. A wildcat play transformed into an end-around that then became a successful passing play. Then Denver ran a similar play right afterwards with mostly the same personnel, but ran the ball this time around.</p>

<p>Defensive tackle Purcell has been a beast against the run for the Broncos.</p>

<p>Two horrible passes from Brandon Allen on red-zone-to-go drives. Second pass resulted in an interception. Dropback football is not his strength.</p>

<p>Broncos defensive line not yielding at all against the run.</p>

<p>Devontae Harris may be a serious liability in pass coverage. Big throws in his direction resulted in a Vikings touchdown.</p>

<p>Vikings adjusted in the second half by doubling Courtland Sutton on key downs.</p>

<p>Denver and their 3-man pass rushes&hellip;..why? You let up a big pass that sustained a Vikings drive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chiefs-vs-chargers-mexico-city">Chiefs vs Chargers (Mexico City)</h2>

<p>Philip Rivers&rsquo; depth of target has been unusually short so far. Though as I write this, Rivers finally threw a deep ball to Mike Williams. That pass was underthrown though.</p>

<p>Rivers just threw an interception on an intermediate throw. Think it might be time for him to retire?</p>

<p>The Chargers&rsquo; rookie left tackle may be a liability.</p>

<p>If the Chargers are to win this game, the win will have to come through the ground game unfortunately.</p>

<p>The Chargers love to drain that play clock for some reason.</p>

<p>Patrick Mahomes with the excellent touch passing.</p>

<p>Chargers shooting themselves in the foot now with defensive penalties, including a penalty that negated a fumble recovery.</p>

<p>Two legitimate pass interference penalties against the Chiefs paved the way for a Chargers touchdown.</p>

<p>Chargers are just a sloppy bunch. Not to mention their defense seems too happy to drop back deep. Though it may be worth noting the linebackers may only be dropping back deep in order to counter Mahomes&rsquo; penchant for the big play.</p>

<p>Pass defense from the Chiefs have stepped up tremendously.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-dolphins">Bills @ Dolphins</h2>

<p>Josh Allen doing serviceably well matriculating the ball through short and intermediate passes.</p>

<p>Vince Biegel of the Dolphins stepping up in defensing the run.</p>

<p>The Bills front seven are shuffling quite a bit around the line of scrimmage, creating confusion and opening up blitz opportunities right up the middle.</p>

<p>Miami is just hopeless at running the ball, apparently. Their wildcat plays, on the other hand, are promising.</p>

<p>Buffalo has been playing pretty aggressive here, even in the 4th quarter up by two scores.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jaguars-colts">Jaguars @ Colts</h2>

<p>Nick Foles did not do a good job of sniffing out a blitz from the Colts. Good job by the Colts, though, blitzing against an overmatched Jaguars offensive line.</p>

<p>The Jaguars are pretty awful at defensing the run. Notably, the linebackers seem easily duped on misdirection plays.</p>

<p>Nick Foles seems too overdependent on DJ Chark to catch his passes.</p>

<p>Leonard Fournette is truly terrible running from a shotgun look. Abandons the inside zone entirely on a handoff from Foles.</p>

<p>Wide receiver screens are a favored play on third downs for this Jaguars offense.</p>

<p>Jacksonville&rsquo;s linebackers are incredibly slow and easy to fool, once again.</p>

<p>Two poor decisions by Foles. Missing open receivers that he should have perhaps picked up on pre-snap. His throws on short crossing routes also tend to be high.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-49ers">Cardinals @ 49ers</h2>

<p>49ers defensive backs are playing off the receivers, almost as if San Francisco&rsquo;s defensive coaches have pegged Arizona is a team known for their deep passing instead of their quick releases and run game trickery.</p>

<p>Sherman failing to adequately cover Christian Kirk on two downs led to big plays that put the Cardinals in a goal-to-go situations on both occasions.</p>

<p>Wide receiver screens are killing this 49ers defense. San Francisco just faced this Arizona squad two weeks ago. Did they not learn anything about this Cardinals offense in that first outing?</p>

			<h4 id="saints-buccaneers-5-5"><em>Saints</em> @ Buccaneers (+5.5)</h4>

<p>Not the biggest fan of taking road favorites, but the Saints are coming off a horrific loss to an opponent that really had no standing to beat them. New Orleans clearly lost focus coming off the bye. That focus should be in place after the loss.</p>

<p>Now cue this game against the Buccaneers. As I noted before, Tampa Bay has a tendency to struggle against division opponents. While I can&rsquo;t say for sure why, it may be related to the fact that division opponents have more inside information about Jameis Winston and his sloppy tendencies. Carolina shellacking the Buccaneers in their second go-around is evidence of this, though it&rsquo;s worth noting that game took place in London.</p>

<p>Regardless, I expect those same struggles to surface again here against a capable Saints defense, even if it&rsquo;s missing the services of its best defensive back in Marshon Lattimore.</p>

<p>The only thing that concerns me is Drew Brees&rsquo; unwillingness to throw deep against this season. It seems age caught up to him. Either way, he&rsquo;ll need to throw deep against a secondary riddled with weak points all over should New Orleans want to win comfortably.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="falcons-panthers-5-5"><em>Falcons</em> @ Panthers (-5.5)</h4>

<p>Does Kyle Allen really deserve to be a 5.5 point favorite against anybody in this league aside from the Bengals? Maybe he&rsquo;ll prove me wrong Sunday, but I doubt it. He still has his issues, though he does tend to play better at home.</p>

<p>But this Panthers defense has been suspect for some time now and I expect the Falcons to put up points so long as Julio Jones can shed James Bradberry off him and Calvin Ridley can step up now that Austin Hooper will be out indefinitely. It also helps that Atlanta is so much better against their division rivals than against other teams - Quinn&rsquo;s approach of spending more time in practice focusing on their division cohorts has paid off here.</p>

<p>Besides, Dan Quinn&rsquo;s recent hands-on approach with the coaching of the defensive line has already yielded promising results against the Saints last week. Even if the Falcons pass rushers don&rsquo;t enjoy the same success they saw in Louisiana last week, it shouldn&rsquo;t take as much pressure to rattle an unseasoned quarterback like Kyle Allen.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="texans-ravens-4">Texans @ <em>Ravens</em> (-4)</h4>

<p>I shied away from this match initially as both teams are too good for me to have any confidence betting one side. But upon further examination, the Ravens have the better head coach, the better set of pass rushers, the home field advantage, and the better overall energy. Generally put, Baltimore is the better team here.</p>

<p>That being said, it does worry me a bit that the Texans are coming into this game with the comeback kid at quarterback and his full complement of receivers. Deshaun Watson has been damn near phenomenal in his short career so far whenever he mounts comebacks. And he could do the same here against a Ravens team trying to salt this game away late in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>Still, Baltimore had experience this season defending against a sensational quarterback in Russell Wilson. That game ended up being Seattle&rsquo;s worst showing this year, as the Seahawks lost control of the game in the fourth quarter. The Ravens coasted to a victory in that match. Maybe the same happens here&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="cardinals-49ers-11">Cardinals @ <em>49ers</em> (-11)</h4>

<p>Give me the elite defense here hurting off a bad loss and playing against a rookie quarterback limited by a playbook built mostly around quick passes and misdirection plays. If the 49ers force the Cardinals to play classical dropback football here, things won&rsquo;t end well for Arizona.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="chiefs-vs-chargers-3-5">Chiefs vs <em>Chargers</em> (+3.5)</h4>

<p>Always a risk to pick against a good team in Kansas City, but the Chiefs are not stout at all on defense. The offense will need to outgun opponents to win decisive matches, but the Chargers are difficult to outgun given their talent on offense, starting with quarterback Philip Rivers.</p>

<p>Besides, I do respect Anthony Lynn&rsquo;s attempts to prep his team to play this game in the high altitudes of Mexico City. Unlike Andy Reid, who seems content letting his team practice as if this were any other game, Anthony Lynn is forcing his team to practice in the heights of Colorado Springs in order to condition them for the hypoxemia that&rsquo;ll hit them as the game wears on.</p>

<p>On top of that, the Chargers taking more than three points makes them all the more tempting.</p>

			<h2 id="bills-browns">Bills @ Browns</h2>

<p>Finally, Baker is re-establishing a rapport with Jarvis Landry.</p>

<p>Three downs to move the ball one yard in order to keep the chains moving. Kitchens opts for three straight passing plays, despite having one of the best halfbacks in the game. Only on the fourth down do you try play action. Amazing.</p>

<p>Cleveland&rsquo;s offensive line cannot play power football. Six rushes roughly three or less yards away from the goal line and the Browns were hopeless on just about every single run, especially against a team that has not been so stout against the rush.</p>

<p>Bills are dangerous with their designed quarterback runs. Two big runs on one drive led to a touchdown.</p>

<p>The Browns&rsquo; goal-to-go play package may have been deciphered by this Bills defense. Cleveland is just absolutely hopeless when just a few yards away from the goal line.</p>

<p>Baker Mayfield is overrated. Not only that, but this Cleveland has screwed up now on two forward pitches, something science initially deemed impossible. I&rsquo;m never betting on this Browns team again.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="giants-jets">Giants @ Jets</h2>

<p>Jets using zone blitzes to try and confuse Daniel Jones. We&rsquo;ll see whether Jones can weather Gregg Williams&rsquo; trickery.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-steelers">Rams @ Steelers</h2>

<p>The Steelers seem to like to spread their linebackers out towards the edge of the tackle box, leaving the defense more vulnerable to runs up the middle.</p>

<p>The Rams defense is intent on having the Steelers play from negative game script. Apparently, Los Angeles is convinced Mason Rudolph and the offense struggle to recover from negative plays.</p>

<p>Mason Rudolph himself has acknowledged his own inability to throw the deep pass. So far though, it seems the man is making more of an effort to generate more air yards, committing himself more to throwing intermediate routes.</p>

<p>McVay&rsquo;s self-scouting is to be taken with a grain of salt. His unwillingness to really change his system up much during the offseason is testament enough that the Rams lack the willpower to truly change and remain ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>Clay Matthews stepping up as the complimentary pass rusher to Aaron Donald.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-cowboys">Vikings @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>Cowboys relying on dropback passing to matriculate the ball instead of play-action and runs.</p>

<p>Screens are eviscerating this Cowboys defense. The Vikings are taking advantage of this overzealous Cowboys defensive front.</p>

<p>Mike Hughes staking his name as the best cornerback on this Vikings secondary.</p>

<p>Worth noting that slight pressure from Michael Bennett threw Cousins off on a big play.</p>

<p>Harrison Smith is the featured blitz defender for the Vikings.</p>

<p>Vikings are committed to their plan of stopping Zeke first and foremost. By large, the Cowboys&rsquo; success on offense has come courtesy of Dak Prescott. Let&rsquo;s see if the Cowboys smarten up and counter through carefully executed play-action concepts.</p>

<p>Poor decision by Kirk Cousins on a free play. Worrisome.</p>

<p>Amari Cooper with his toe-tap receptions is damn near magical.</p>

<p>The Vikings deciphered the Cowboys and their running game. Zeke was neutered here. Other coaches should be looking at this game as a template on how to stop the Cowboys from rushing the ball at will.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="seahawks-49ers">Seahawks @ 49ers</h2>

<p>Seahawks coming out strong with the press coverage.</p>

<p>Jadaveon Clowney stepping up and not falling for any of the trickery of the 49ers offense.</p>

<p>49ers making money off slants against Seattle&rsquo;s man coverage.</p>

<p>Jimmy Garoffalo is sailing his passes tonight. His errant passing is throwing this game for the 49ers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-buccaneers">Cardinals @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>The Cardinals have been wowing me with initial set of misdirection plays on their first drive.</p>

<p>But then in the red zone, things quickly fall apart. For some reason, Arizona lacks imagination when it comes to red zone plays. Their season red zone scoring percentage seems to be a testament to this.</p>

<p>The Cardinals are winning the battle in the trenches against the Buccaneers offense. Tampa Bay is struggling to run the ball and pass protect against Arizona&rsquo;s pass rushers.</p>

<p>Still, Tampa Bay was able to work the ball down into the end zone through fortunate penalties, a fantastic catch by Mike Evans, and the Cardinals simply being inept in their prevent defense.</p>

<p>Kliff Kingsbury seems to be scheming things so that Kyler Murray gets rid of the ball quickly.</p>

<p>Arizona&rsquo;s offensive line failed in their run-blocking and pass protection discipline on a sequence of four plays, killing a promising drive.</p>

<p>On a late-game drive, Tampa Bay only saw success on a scramble from Jameis on a 3rd-and-long situation and two chain-moving throws to receivers NOT named Mike Evans.</p>

<p>Arizona with the wicked fake punt to keep the drive alive.</p>

<p>Kyler Murray is being given options on these plays. On one play, the rookie opted out of a wide receiver screen to throw a deep out route to Larry Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay&rsquo;s run defense is stout, thanks in no small part to players like Vita Vea and Jason Pierre-Paul.</p>

<p>Godwin turning into the Bucs&rsquo; de facto second receiver.</p>

<p>Arizona&rsquo;s conditioning towards the end of the game is a cause for concern. Missed tackles and sloppy form.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="panthers-packers">Panthers @ Packers</h2>

<p>Carolina initiating things with a run-heavy drive.</p>

<p>Packers moving the ball down on the Panthers with a couple touch throws from Rodgers. His pass protection has held up remarkably.</p>

<p>Kyle Allen can be mobile.</p>

<p>Green Bay&rsquo;s receivers seem to have trouble gaining separation from defensive backs.</p>

<p>Two sideline throws to Davante Adams have been key to getting the Packers in position for touchdowns.</p>

<p>The Panthers&rsquo; left tackle is a liability in protection. He was largely the reason a promising drive ended prematurely.</p>

<p>Luke Kuechly has been strangely off in his defense against the run. His decisions are flatly wrong. On one drive, the Panthers gave up a little over 40 yards rushing en route to a Packers touchdown. Part of the reason why is the linebackers not executing on their responsibilities to guard against the run.</p>

			<h5 id="cardinals-buccaneers-4-5"><em>Cardinals</em> @ Buccaneers (-4.5)</h5>

<p>A little wary of this pick, as Tampa Bay tends to play better against non-division opponents. And really, the Buccaneers should have covered last week against Seattle, which means this spread should be a touch higher.</p>

<p>Still&hellip;Arizona has been remarkably competent over the past couple weeks. Kliff Kingsbury&rsquo;s willingness to tweak his air raid philosophy over the past few weeks and incorporate more rushing plays into the offensive playbook has paid off in spades. Kyler Murray and this Cardinals team have found their rhythm and played well, even putting up an admirable performance against the league&rsquo;s best defense last week. I expect the good times to keep on going, especially if Patrick Peterson and Buddha Baker are out there in the secondary picking off some of Jameis Winston&rsquo;s errant throws.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="falcons-saints-13">Falcons @ <em>Saints</em> (-13)</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of taking the Saints as double-digit favorites, as the team has a habit of taking games off every now and then. But against a hated division rival, I do expect New Orleans to play hard here, especially if the potential is there to run up points against a Falcons defense made out of cardboard cut-outs.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="lions-bears-2-5">Lions @ <em>Bears</em> (-2.5)</h5>

<p>The Bears are just awful. Simply awful. But this Lions team isn&rsquo;t really much better, even though Stafford&rsquo;s commitment to deeper throws has made this offense look better. It&rsquo;s the milquetoast defense that&rsquo;s the problem - the Lions are awful at generating pressure with their front four linemen and pretty predictable with their man coverage schemes. If Nagy can scheme up enough plays to expose Detroit&rsquo;s predictability on defense, Chicago can scrape by here with a win.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="dolphins-colts-10">Dolphins @ <em>Colts</em> (-10)</h5>

<p>Even though Indianapolis has yet to win a game by more than 7 points this season, it seems this would be the perfect game to run away with the points. Unlike the careful Jacoby Brissett, Brian Hoyer is more willing to take chances and fling those home run balls. Those opportunities will be there against one of the league&rsquo;s worst pass defenses, especially if T.Y. Hilton is healthy.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="rams-steelers-3-5">Rams @ <em>Steelers</em> (+3.5)</h5>

<p>It seems a little odd to me that the Rams would be significant road favorites against a decent Steelers team. Yes, Pittsburgh&rsquo;s offense isn&rsquo;t quite the same with Mason Rudolph at its helm&hellip;but then again, has the Rams offense been the same since the Super Bowl last season? I think people here are too quickly falling back in love with McVay after his team posted back-to-back wins against bottom-tier teams.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that the Rams offensive line still presents a liability here, one that can be exploited by one of the league&rsquo;s better pass-rushing units.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="bills-browns-3">Bills @ <em>Browns</em> (-3)</h5>

<p>The Bills ridiculously poor run defense will not serve them well here against Nick Chubb. Now if Cleveland can stop shooting themselves in the foot&hellip;</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<h2 id="texans-jaguars-london">Texans @ Jaguars (London)</h2>

<p>Leonard Fournette being a power runner doesn&rsquo;t bode well for a Jaguars team playing from behind.</p>

<p>Remind me to never side with a rookie quarterback in his second outing against a division opponent. The Texans are not getting any pressure on Minshew, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter as Houston seems to have gotten a beat on the Jaguars passing tendencies. The Texans&rsquo; coverage schemes are taking away many of the offensive concepts Minshew has gotten comfortable executing. Without those easy throws, Minshew is left spooked.</p>

<p>Then again, it also hurts that Minshew is lacking a playmaker in Dede Westbrook today.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="colts-steelers">Colts @ Steelers</h2>

<p>Jabaal Sheard may be the Colts&rsquo; best defensive linemen. Making stops against the run and against 4th down trick plays too.</p>

<p>The Colts offensive line is incredibly dominant. The Steelers pass rush is nearly nonexistent. Brian Hoyer is being given too much time to pick apart the Steelers zone defense.</p>

<p>Zone defense is too risky when you don&rsquo;t have the horses to execute that style of defense. And the Colts matriculating the ball downfield with ease tells me that the Steelers don&rsquo;t have those horses.</p>

<p>The Colts defense played so well on the last drive, forcing the Steelers into short passes that essentially drained clock. Had it not been for an overzealous Darius Leonard, the Steelers would have done nothing on that last drive. Frank reich and Matt Eburfleus have this team excellently coached.</p>

<p>Calling more blitzes in the second half will be the key difference for the Steelers should they pull out the win here. Still, their offensive play-calling is not helping matters either today. Randy Fichtner picks the wrong times to be conservative. Not to mention some of his play-calls have been less than inspiring.</p>

<p>This Steelers team is so frustrating. It&rsquo;s no wonder why Pittsburgh has only won against losing teams and have yet to claim victory against winning teams before today. It seems Pittsburgh is a team trying to show itself to be more talented than they actually are.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="buccaneers-seahawks">Buccaneers @ Seahawks</h2>

<p>Not much of a surprise, but Jameis genuinely plays better against teams not as familiar with him.</p>

<p>It also helps that the Seahawks are unable to generate any pressure with their pass rushing specialists alone. Having to resort to the blitz leaves passing lanes open that Jameis can exploit more often than not.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Seahawks decide to throw some big passes on a drive that could have been a closing drive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="browns-broncos">Browns @ Broncos</h2>

<p>Broncos are mercilessly killing this Browns defense on one drive using heavy play action on multiple first downs.</p>

<p>Browns tackling is absolutely sloppy. Why did I take this team again as road favorites? Never take bad teams on the road, especially when they&rsquo;re giving points to the other side.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-chiefs">Vikings @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Tyreek Hill&rsquo;s ability to beat bracket coverage is really something. Kudos to Matt Moore for throwing a good pass.</p>

<p>Cousins is not as effective as he was the last three weeks.</p>

<p>The Chiefs have done an excellent job bottling up the run so far in the first quarter. In fact, something tells me the defense has gotten a beat on the way the Vikings run the football.</p>

<p>Solid defensive play-calling to kill a Chiefs drive late in the game. Sending more men over the weak side of the line ended up putting a good bit more pressure on Matt Moore.</p>

<p>The Vikings defense has hit home a few times when it comes to pressuring the passer, but Matt Moore threw two key balls over to Tyreek Hill on a drive that ended in a critical field goal. Tyreek Hill is a game-changer.</p>

<p>The Chiefs defensive tackles are consistently winning their battles against the interior of the Vikings offensive line.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-panthers">Titans @ Panthers</h2>

<p>Panthers are horrid at defending against the run.</p>

<p>The interior of the Titans offensive line may be a point of weakness.</p>

<p>Solid coverage by the Panthers defensive backs.</p>

<p>Tennessee&rsquo;s defense on the other hand leaves much to be desired. Being gifted a few interceptions by Jameis Winston last week seems to have left them overconfident. The only good thing the defense is doing is getting pressure on the quarterback. Yet that pressure means little if you let the Panthers convert on downs like 3rd and 14. The worst part is that Carolina moved the chains on that down with a wide receiver screen that was only designed to net several yards and set up an easier field goal.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="lions-raiders">Lions @ Raiders</h2>

<p>So far on this Lions first drive, Detroit is cutting through this Oakland defense like swiss cheese.</p>

<p>But a bungled handoff from Stafford to McKissic leads to a lost fumble, killing that drive.</p>

<p>Josh Jacobs is something special. Up there with Dalvin Cook and Alvin Kamara in terms of shiftiness and agility.</p>

<p>Daryl Worley is a major point of weakness in the Oakland defensive backfield.</p>

<p>Derek Carr playing smart, making quick decisions even in weird situations.</p>

<p>Lazy coverage, sloppy zone execution from linebackers&hellip;Oakland&rsquo;s pass defense is a mess.</p>

<p>No punts in the first quarter and a half. Says something about the relative quality of the offenses against these defenses.</p>

<p>Trey Flowers coming up big on two consecutive plays, effectively killing an Oakland drive.</p>

<p>Johnathan Hankins making a difference against the run in particular.</p>

<p>The Raiders defense seems to have adjusted in the second half by blitzing more. Seems to be working out so far&hellip;</p>

<p>Carr bailed out of the pocket too early on 3rd down, essentially limiting his options and killing the drive.</p>
