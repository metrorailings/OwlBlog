			<h2 id="tier-4"><strong><em>Tier 4</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Jameis Winston</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Mike Evans (WR), O.J. Howard (TE),</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Chris Godwin (WR), Breshad Perriman (WR), Peyton Barber (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Ndamukong Suh (DT), Jason Pierre-Paul (OLB),</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Jason Licht (GM), Bruce Arians ( New HC), Byron Leftwich (New OC), Todd Bowles (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>The entire offensive coaching staff has been revamped under new head coach, Bruce Arians. Arians sweeps in with an entirely new coaching staff, starting with Byron Leftwich as the offensive coordinator and Todd Bowles at defensive coordinator, followed by a whole slew of fresh position coaches working underneath them.</p>

<hr />

<p>Last year, I correctly billed this team as a bottom-feeder. Jameis Winston disappointed, as expected. The defense didn’t live up to its potential as well, resulting in Mike Smith getting canned midseason.</p>

<p>This year though&hellip;I do expect a bit of a renaissance for Tampa Bay. Sure, the team lost some talent on both sides of the ball - linebacker Kwon Alexander, wide receiver Adam Humphries, and star defensive tackle Gerald McCoy are no longer with the team. But the team’s potential here stems from its solid coaching staff and the surprise factor involved with the arrival of a new coaching regime. I have faith in Bruce Arians being able to correct Jameis and most of his bad habits. I have faith in Todd Bowles conjuring up a defense that’s greater than the sum of its parts. Maybe best of all, I have faith in the history between Arians and much of his coaching staff. There’s a reason why Arians refused to come out of retirement unless he was able to bring many of his former associates with him to Tampa. The rapport that many of the new coaches have with one another (and more importantly, with Arians) will help speed the regime transition along.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that Jameis Winston is so much more likely to thrive under Arians. If there’s one thing both men love, it’s the deep ball. After all, Winston’s recklessness with the football stems from his pathological love of big plays. Even though Dirk Koetter labored to turn Jameis into a more traditional quarterback with structured reads, it didn’t work - his eyes would always trend towards receivers running deeper routes. But Bruce Arian offenses are known for their religious devotion to the big pass play. So unlike most other coaches, Arians would actually encourage Jameis to embrace his risky tendencies and throw the ball deep. In other words, we may end up seeing a surprisingly strong marriage between these two.</p>

<p>I actually think the Buccaneers can get more than six wins this season. In fact, the Buccaneers have an outside shot at winning the division outright. Honestly, I’d be so much more confident declaring Tampa Bay a solid team if this defense wasn’t so woefully lacking in talent. But if younger players like Vita Vea finally step up this year, then this defense may be serviceable.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-6"><strong><em>Tier 6</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Mitch Trubisky</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Mitch Trubisky (Mobile QB), Tarik Cohen (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Allen Robinson (WR), Cordarrelle Patterson (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Akeem Hicks (DT), Khalil Mack (DE), Kyle Fuller (CB), Roquan Smith (LB), Danny Trevathan (LB), Buster Skrine (CB), Prince Amukamara (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Ryan Pace (GM), Matt Nagy (HC), Mark Helfrich (OC), Chuck Pagano (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, the staff has remained fully intact, with the addition of Brad Childress as an advisor.</p>

<p>On defense, we have nearly the complete opposite. Only the defensive line coach and a quality control assistant managed to survive the transition from the Vic Fangio era to the Chuck Pagano era. It is worth noting that the quality control coach that was kept from last year has been reassigned as the safeties coach this year. It’ll be interesting to see if this defense can reassume elite form this year given the defensive coaching overhaul.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Bears impressed last year, finally returning to the playoffs as division champions after an eight-year hiatus. This year, it’ll be a steep uphill battle to defend their position atop the North.</p>

<p>One thing that concerns is that coaching overhaul on defense. The new defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano cut his teeth serving as a defensive backs coach for the better part of his NFL career. While he’s successfully trained up cornerbacks and safeties over the years, his track record managing linebackers and defensive linemen has been rather spotty. Furthermore, coaching regime shifts can sometimes be messy, especially if we have new regimes overseeing a unit that was remarkably successful in its last year. And given the success this Chicago defensive outfit saw last year, I wouldn’t be all too surprised to see some tension between the Bear defenders and their new coaches, especially if these coaches insist on having these players do things that run counter to the style of football that made them so dominant last year.</p>

<p>The other thing that concerns me more is Mitch Trubisky. I look at Mitch and I see another Blake Bortles in the making. Mitch is atrocious as a passer. His fundamentals are out of whack. His throws lack accuracy. His decision-making is still questionable. Sure, he played sensationally in his first playoff game against the Eagles last year&hellip;but so did Blake when the Jaguars marched into the postseason two years ago. Those Jaguars actually fought their way to the conference championship thanks to a few masterful performances from Bortles. And yet, Bortles flunked out of Jacksonville last year, as some analytical experts rightfully predicted.</p>

<p>Can Trubisky improve this year? Sure. Unlike Bortles, Trubisky is still a young buck that has one of the NFL’s better offensive minds coaching him. Maybe Matt Nagy can channel his inner Anne Sullivan and transform Mitch into a functional quarterback&hellip;but my intuition here tells me that Nagy’s efforts will be in vain. That being said, I don’t expect this team to regress as badly as the Jaguars last year. After all, that defense has some spectacular talent. And the Jaguars were special in the way they blew up last year - it wasn’t so much a regression to the mean as it was a catastrophic meltdown. What are the chances of another meltdown happening so soon?</p>

<p>All that being said, another trip to the playoffs is incredibly unlikely for this team, let alone any team with a dysfunctional offense.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Matthew Stafford</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Kenny Golladay (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Kerryon Johnson (RB), Marvin Jones (WR), Danny Amendola (WR), T.J. Hockenson (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Darius Slay (CB), Trey Flowers (DE), Damon Harrison (DT), Mike Daniels (DT)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Bob Quinn (GM), Matt Patricia (HC), Darrell Bevell (New OC), Paul Pasqualoni (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Despite hiring a new offensive coordinator to helm the offense, the Lions didn’t flip much at the position group level, only replacing the coaches overseeing the quarterbacks and running backs.</p>

<p>On defense, things have remained mostly intact from last year.</p>

<hr />

<p>Last year was a disappointment. Matt Patricia came in and took a very eccentric approach to the way he conducted things as a head coach, even going as far as telling a beat reporter to sit up straight at a press conference. And now this year, the man is proud to have his team straight up touted as the Detroit Patriots, given all the things he’s done to emulate the Patriots’ approach to football and team-building. Apparently, Patricia doesn’t understand that emulating a winning formula is not enough to actually build a winning team. Every organization must foster their own culture and develop their own way of doing things in order to succeed. It’s fine to borrow elements from other organizations, but to cop another team’s style entirely smacks of naivete.</p>

<p>Besides that, Matt Patricia also gambled on the run game last year, opting to make his Lions a run-first team. It wasn’t a prudent decision. Detroit bottomed out of the division in his first year as a head coach. In his defense, one could argue that the Lions lack the raw talent necessary to engineer a dominant rushing attack. But does that even matter? In today’s game, it should be obvious that the air game is so much more valuable compared to the run game. So prioritizing the latter at the expense of the former once again smacks of naivete.</p>

<p>This year, the Lions may see a bit more life on offense under new offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell, but let’s not forget Bevell was run out of Seattle for good reason. Bevell had a strange playbook that mixed good and bad concepts in equal parts. That inconsistency makes failure a very real possibility here. The defense doesn’t seem much better, though it’s worth noting that since scooping up Mike Daniels, the Lions now feature one of the league’s heavier defensive fronts. That should bode well against other teams that need to rush the ball to open up the offense.</p>

<p>All things said, I have a hard time finding positive things worth mentioning about this team. Matt Patricia may be a good coordinator, but his actions as a head coach leaves me baffled. I cannot be high on a team when its head coach perplexes me. Expect a losing season here. It’s very possible for the team to end up as a bottom feeder as well.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-2"><strong><em>Tier 2</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Kirk Cousins</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Adam Thielen (WR), Stefon Diggs (WR), Dalvin Cook (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Kyle Rudolph (TE), Ameer Abdullah (RB), Chad Beebe (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Everson Griffen (DE), Danielle Hunter (DE), Linval Joseph (DT), Anthony Barr (LB), Anthony Kendricks (LB), Harrison Smith (SS), Xavier Rhodes (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Rick Spielman (GM), Mike Zimmer (HC), Kevin Stefanski/Gary Kubiak (New OC), George Edwards (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Even though the interim offensive coordinator has been formally hired into his role this year, things are significantly different on offense. I suspect that’s mostly because of Gary Kubiak coming onboard as an offense guru and the assistant head coach under Mike Zimmer. Other than the running backs coach and an offensive line assistant, the entire staff has been replaced from last year.</p>

<p>On defense, however, things have remained the same. The only change has come with the addition of Terence Newman as an assistant defensive backs coach. While Newman didn’t exactly light the world on fire as a cornerback, the former player understands the finer aspects of Zimmer’s system and has the experience needed to mentor younger defensive backs.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Vikings last year had their postseason hopes dashed due to some awkward performances from Kirk Cousins, some horrendous pass protection from an underwhelming offensive line, and some bad coaching from then offensive coordinator John DeFilippo. Mike Zimmer thankfully fired DeFilippo near the end of the season the moment it became obvious that the team could not count on him to coach a consistently viable offense. In his place went Kevin Stefanski, who impressed enough to keep his job this year, even as the team brought Gary Kubiak onboard as an advisor.</p>

<p>Honestly, now that I look at this Vikings team&hellip;.I’m looking at a Super Bowl contender here. Minnesota has the makings of a championship team - a solid coaching staff, a roster loaded with quality players across the board, a franchise quarterback, and a respectable home field advantage.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the team is without weak points. One major downside that concerns me is the offensive line - Minnesota lacks any decent depth along the trenches on offense. Even though the Vikings spent a first-round draft pick this year on a center, it’s still going to take some time for the rookie to get up to speed. Furthermore, the Vikings released most of their guards from last year, leaving them cripplingly thin along the interior of the line. The signing of Josh Kline and the drafting of Dru Samia provides some superficial depth, but one injury along the line could cause havoc and trigger a reshuffling, in which linemen will once again be forced to play out of their natural positions in a desperate attempt to field a workable offensive line. Kirk Cousins would suffer the most if the Vikings are forced to reorganize the offensive line, as the man needs all the help he can get.</p>

<p>We also see some major overhaul along the offensive coaching staff, courtesy of Gary Kubiak. It usually takes some time for a new coaching staff to synergize with the players. But new coaching regimes have taken teams to the Super Bowl before. It does help to have a strong defense that can back up an offense still adjusting to a new scheme. Not only that, but Kubiak has won a Super Bowl in his own right with the Broncos several years ago. So I wouldn’t be too worried about the new offensive coaches here - they should be able to find their bearings sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>I expect this team to win the North and contend with the Eagles and the Saints for the NFC crown.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-5"><strong><em>Tier 5</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Aaron Rodgers</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Davante Adams (WR), Aaron Rodgers (Mobile QB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Aaron Jones (RB), Jimmy Graham (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Za’Darius Smith (DT/LB), Preston Smith (OLB), Rashan Gary (OLB), Adrian Amos (SS), Jaire Alexander (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Brian Gutekunst (GM), Matt LaFleur (New HC), Nathaniel Hackett (New OC), Mike Pettine (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, only the running backs coach from last year managed to survive the Packers’ transition away from the Mike McCarthy era.</p>

<p>On defense, even though Mike Pettine was retained as the defensive coordinator, most of the assistants underneath him have been flipped. Only the defensive line coach and the secondaries coach have been kept from last year. Interestingly enough, none of the defensive coaches have been designated as run game or pass game coordinators - it seems the end of the McCarthy era means no more defensive sub-coordinators to complicate the coaching structure.</p>

<hr />

<p>Note that the Packers are favored to end the season on a winning record. I find that fascinating.</p>

<p>On one hand, it’s not that difficult to make a great case for the Packers doing well this year. Aaron Rodgers is still one of the best quarterbacks in the game, injuries be damned. The defensive roster this year better reflects Mike Pettine’s vision of an ideal defense. Matt LaFleur’s approach to offensive football is refreshingly different from that of Mike McCarthy’s.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, pessimists can make the argument that all these coaching, philosophical, and personnel changes are too much for any team to grasp in the matter of a few months - in other words, it’ll take time for these Packers to bond with one another, let alone adopt a new style of offense that’s significantly different from the offense they’ve been running over the last several years under McCarthy.</p>

<p>The pessimist argument rings truer to me then the optimist’s outlook. Sure, I’m more inclined towards arguments that sow doubt over hope&hellip;but the reality is that the Packers have made so many dramatic changes heading into this season. All these new parts that were brought into the fold this year need some time to settle into place. So expect a slow start followed by steady improvement. A postseason berth is not completely impossible here, but it’s going to require some serious misfortune befalling on their division rivals and the emergence of a second wide receiver that can complement Davante Adams.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-8"><strong><em>Tier 8</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Case Keenum, Dwayne Haskins</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>N/A</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Jordan Reed (TE), Vernon Davis (TE), Josh Doctson (WR), Adrian Peterson (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Matt Ioannidis (DE), Montez Sweat (OLB), Ryan Kerrigan (OLB), Landon Collins (SS), Josh Norman (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Bruce Allen (GM/Exec), Jay Gruden (HC), Kevin O’Connell (New OC), Greg Manusky (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, we have a peculiar situation. The offensive coordinator from last year has been demoted to an offensive assistant this year. In his former role goes last year’s quarterbacks coach, Kevin O’Connell. O’Connell is apparently a bit of a rising star within the organization. All the other coaches on the offensive staff have been retained, save for Wes Phillips, who likely left the organization voluntarily to join his pal Sean McVay and his dad Wade Phillips over in Los Angeles. In his place goes a new face that wasn’t on the team before.</p>

<p>On defense, Greg Manusky managed to keep his job and most of his staff. The inside linebackers and defensive backs coaches from last year have both been replaced this year with veteran coaches that have served as coordinators, albeit with muddled degrees of success.</p>

<hr />

<p>These Redskins are a goddamn mess. Frankly, I’ll be gobsmacked if this team doesn’t end the season with one of the worst records (if not <strong><em>the</em></strong> worst record).</p>

<p>One thing that baffles me is their decision to demote last year’s offensive coordinator instead of outright firing him. Why keep your old offensive coordinator around in a lesser role? Not only is it demoralizing, but that move potentially jeopardizes any efforts by the team’s senior management to bring harmony back into the organization after a disastrous season last year.</p>

<p>On defense, things are only slightly better from a coaching perspective. Greg Manusky managed to survive despite his defense’s sorry performances last year. However, the Redskins brain trust are trying to help him by hiring two veteran coaches in Rob Ryan and Ray Horton. Both men will serve under Manusky as position coaches and thankfully not as assistant coordinators - neither have succeeded as coordinators themselves. If these three coaches could actually function well together, this defense may actually be serviceable for once. But with Rob Ryan having a bit of a history as a firebrand and Ray Horton not having had much success in his most recent stints, I can’t be certain that these defensive coaches will sync with one another.</p>

<p>Beyond coaching, things don’t get much better. On offense, the Redskins look less like a professional football team and more like a war-torn country. Neither Case Keenum nor Dwayne Haskins look ready to assume control of the offense. That offensive line is in shambles, especially now that Trent Williams seems intent on holding out indefinitely out of concern for his health. And worst of all, Washington lacks any notable skill players. Notice that I didn’t name even a single player as a definitive vector on offense. The Redskins are the only team that lack reliable playmakers on offense. Instead, we have an assortment of players that have only showed up every now and then. If two of the skill players manage to break out as reliable producers, I’ll be impressed, especially given the team’s sad situation at quarterback.</p>

<p>The defense isn’t that bad, but it isn’t necessarily good either. Questions remain about whether this defense can bounce back after a disastrous season last year. The biggest question comes up front, as the defense lacks solid pass rushers now that Preston Smith left for greener pastures over in Wisconsin. Kerrigan cannot carry this pass rush by himself.</p>

<p>All that being said, I expect the Redskins to be one of the worst teams in football.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Eli Manning, Daniel Jones</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Sterling Shepard (WR), Saquon Barkley (RB), Golden Tate (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Evan Engram (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Janoris Jenkins (CB), Michael Thomas (FS), Jabrill Peppers (SS), Dalvin Tomlinson (DT)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Dave Gettleman (GM), Pat Shurmur (HC), Mike Shula (OC), James Bettcher (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>The Giants have kept their whole offensive coaching staff from last year.</p>

<p>On defense, only about half the coaches have been retained. The assistant linebackers coach and the two defensive backs coaches have been replaced this year, likely in an attempt to improve the lagging passing defense in a league predisposed to airing the ball out.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’ll actually be interesting to see how the Giants do this year. Despite Dave Gettleman’s criminal mismanagement of this organization, the roster still features some considerable talent. Pat Shurmur has kept many of his coaches from last year too, so nothing much changes from a schematic standpoint - players should have an easier time settling into their groove this year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Giants have a major problem at quarterback - Eli Manning. The man is a danger to this team. His unwillingness to throw the ball any further than ten yards severely limits the team’s potential on offense. And in today’s NFL, a team that cannot effectively air the ball out is doomed to failure. Listen, I love Eli and I’ll always cherish him for bringing two Super Bowl rings to the team. 2011 was the year I fell in love with football, and it was all because Eli single-handedly dragged these Giants to the championship that season. It was a season that forever cemented his legacy as a Giant great. But all great men fall victim to father time sooner or later - Manning is no different. His era has passed. It’s time for Daniel Jones to succeed him as the franchise quarterback.</p>

<p>That being said, it’ll take time for Jones to adjust to life in the NFL. Rookie quarterbacks almost never see immediate success their first year in the league. And according to the experts, Jones is still rough around the edges coming out of college - if so, then expect the man to take a year or two making quite a few mistakes as he hones his talents.</p>

<p>It also doesn’t help that the team is absolutely gutless at the pass rush. After dealing Olivier Vernon to the Browns, Gettleman has left this team completely bare along the edges of the defensive line. The hope here is that Lorenzo Carter and Markus Golden can serviceably fill in that void, what with the former having a full year of experience under his belt and the latter having thrived before under James Bettcher back when Bettcher was the defensive coordinator for the Cardinals. But we’ll need to wait and see whether this plan pans out.</p>

<p>You know what though&hellip;if there is one good thing to be said about New York’s defensive front, it’s that the Giants are fielding some big bodies along the trenches. B.J. Hill, Dalvin Tomlinson, and Dexter Lawrence lend some serious size to that defensive line, and that’ll be key at stopping opposing rushers from running buck wild up the middle.</p>

<p>The Giants are still rebuilding. That defense will need roughly two to three years to regain top form now that most of their major players from recent years past have been shipped out or unsigned. And that’s fine, as Daniel Jones will need a few seasons to sharpen his skills as a passer. It’s possible the team could pull as many as six wins this season, but expect nothing more than that.</p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Jerry Jones (GM), Jason Garrett (HC), Kellen Moore (New OC), Rod Marinelli (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, quarterbacks coach Kellen Moore was promoted this year to offensive coordinator, replacing the beleaguered Scott Linehan. Jon Kitna will take over his former position on the coaching staff.</p>

<p>On defense, nothing has changed from last year.</p>

<hr />

<p>I feel silly billing this team as Super Bowl contenders last year. Even though the Cowboys won the division and clawed their way to the division round in the postseason, it wasn’t an inspiring season to say the least. The Cowboys notched too many wins by slim margins last year - take away the game against Jacksonville and Dallas’ point differential for the season dips into the negatives.</p>

<p>A few good things have been done during the offseason. In an effort to turn around an offense that was stagnant for much of the season, the team wisely let Scott Linehan go. Kellen Moore has been promoted in his stead. And promisingly enough, Moore seems more willing to try new things this year, even giving lip service to this idea of letting Dak run around with the ball at times. It was a tactic that was glaringly missing from Linehan’s playbook last year. Still, I do have my doubts about whether Moore <em>is actually allowed</em> to unleash Dak if necessary - I’m not sure if Jason Garrett or Jerry Jones are able to tolerate the risk of Dak sustaining injury as he’s running around the field. Many folks were calling for more scramble plays last year too, but the Cowboys insisted on keeping Dak situated in the pocket.</p>

<p>And really, that leads me to the major issue at hand here - I question Jason Garrett as a head coach. Hell, I even question Jerry Jones as a general manager. Before the regular season even started last year, it was a known fact that the Cowboys were deficient on quality receivers. I thought the team’s brain trust was well aware of the issue and would find a fix early into the season. Instead, it took an expensive trade for Amari Cooper late into November to jump-start the air game. And Cooper, as talented as he may be, is only one man. Coming into this season, this team still hasn’t done much to alleviate their receiver concerns. Randall Cobb was brought into the ranks over from Green Bay, but I honestly see this as more a lateral move given Cole Beasley’s departure over the offseason. The only upward move may have been resigning the aging Jason Witten, though doubts linger about whether he can perform even passably after taking a year off from the game. On top of that, Sanjay Lal still remains the team’s wide receivers coach, despite overseeing a unit that fell far short of its potential last year.</p>

<p>But while question marks still persist on offense and coaching, the defense looks to be solid yet again this year. Consistency in personnel and coaching this year should help the defense settle back quicker into its groove this year. And even though that defensive front only has one elite talent in its ranks, Rod Marinelli seems to find ways to have that defensive line outperform the sum of its individual parts. More importantly, the back seven remains as strong as ever, headlined by the linebacking duo of Leighton Vander Esch and Jaylon Smith. It’s these two that set the tone for the rest of their comrades. Barring multiple injuries to key players, the defense should once again carry this team to a few wins.</p>

<p>So where do I stand here? I see the Cowboys as a middling team that could break into the postseason once more, depending on luck and whether Kellen Moore is allowed to weave more creativity into the offensive playbook. Or maybe it all depends on how hard Jason Garrett will be clapping when his team needs him the most&hellip;</p>
