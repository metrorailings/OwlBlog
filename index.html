			<p>Rather than do quick statements discussing the Patriots and their victory over Kansas City to retain possession of the AFC crown&hellip;I&rsquo;ll be doing a deep dive here in order to more correctly illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this New England team as they head into the Super Bowl.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="1st-quarter">1st Quarter</h4>

<p>The first play of the day sets the tone for the Patriots on offense. Against a seven-man box, Sony Michel still manages to chew off 11 yards behind some excellent blocks by his offensive linemen, his fullback James Develin, and tight end Rob Gronkowski. And now it begins to dawn on me - what good is a fantastic pass rush if the defensive line is completely inept at stopping the run?</p>

<p>That first drive was just domination by the Patriots. The Chiefs had forced New England into a 3rd and long position near the end of the drive, but for some awful reason, the Chiefs decided to put their best edge rusher in coverage against the Patriots&rsquo; best receiver. Even though Dee Ford was able to hold his own against Julian Edelman for a few seconds, the Chiefs&rsquo; neutered pass rush was unable to even so much as breathe on Tom Brady, allowing for an easy completion over the middle.</p>

<p>Poor coaching will be a repeated emphasis here. People have ridiculed Andy Reid for his record of failure in the postseason. Some have even theorized that the man is simply unable to lead a team to the promised land. And I&rsquo;m starting to believe that. Andy Reid and Bob Sutton were thoroughly out-coached here, as I&rsquo;ll point out time and time again.</p>

<p>On the Chiefs&rsquo; first drive, I think it&rsquo;s becoming clear Patrick Mahomes is racked by nerves coming into this match. Why is he insisting on throwing the ball to Sammy Watkins twice in a row? On that first play, Travis Kelce was more open than Watkins. On the second play, Watkins was held in check by the Patriots&rsquo; best cornerback in Stephon Gilmore. I understand Tyreek Hill is being blanketed in double coverage, but then the next man up should be either Travis Kelce or your speedy halfback in Damien Williams&hellip;.not Sammy &lsquo;asshat&rsquo; Watkins.</p>

<p>I think the Patriots have keyed in on an awful tendency in Mahomes&rsquo; passing game - the sophomore quarterback is addicted to throwing the ball deep. Take away his best deep threat in Tyreek Hill and he&rsquo;ll respond by targeting Sammy Watkins instead. It makes sense - Watkins is supposed to the other skill player complimenting Hill in the deep passing offense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to Andy Reid to iron this tendency out from his young quarterback, but it&rsquo;s clear the veteran coach has not yet fixed this aspect of Mahomes&rsquo; game. It&rsquo;s still not too late to make Patrick see the error of his ways, but as we&rsquo;ll see, very little will change as we progress in this game.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hits on Mahomes: 2</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="2nd-quarter">2nd Quarter</h4>

<p>The first Chiefs drive this quarter saw the Patriots pressuring Mahomes on two plays. Despite that, Kansas City was in a position to move the chains, but Damien Williams failed to punch ahead for one yard on 3rd down.</p>

<p>The second Chiefs drive could have ended in a touchdown. After a beautiful bomb to Tyreek Hill, Kansas City was in prime scoring position. On the very next play, the Patriots called a six-man blitz, leaving all the skill players in single coverage situations. Had Patrick Mahomes thrown a slightly better ball, Damien Williams would have had a touchdown reception here. Instead, it seems New England&rsquo;s pass rushers were able to suffocate pocket just enough to compel Mahomes into throwing an awkward pass. The result will go down as an incompletion, but it really was a missed opportunity to tie up the game against New England. On third down, the Patriots called yet another blitz that finally hit home and resulted in a sack that took Kansas out of field goal range. It was a sad end to the Chiefs&rsquo; most promising drive up to this point.</p>

<p>New England, meanwhile, was able to move the ball seemingly at will. Luckily, two of their drives in the quarter ended with no points, thanks to bad plays from Tom Brady and James White. The former threw a silly interception in the end zone and the latter couldn&rsquo;t reel in a screen pass that would have likely gone for significant yardage.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what though, that last New England drive was a master class in coaching. Not only did the Patriots commit to running the ball in order to wipe as much time off the clock as possible, but New England made fools out of this Kansas City defensive line on two occasions with well-timed screens. Once again, I have to emphasize the coaching here - the Patriots have some phenomenal coaches here. I have to commend them for instilling some discipline here in their their defensive players - the Patriots box defenders rarely fell for Kansas City&rsquo;s attempts at misdirection and trickery.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hits on Mahomes: 4</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="3rd-quarter">3rd Quarter</h4>

<p>The Chiefs fire out of the gate with a four-play touchdown drive. Most notably, Mahomes wasn&rsquo;t touched even once on this drive, not even on a critical 3rd down when the Patriots only sent three rushers to try and pressure him. A big pass to Sammy Watkins despite Stephon Gilmore in coverage put the Chiefs in the red zone. Then the next play was well-designed - Travis Kelce was positioned on the right while Tyreek Hill was stationed to the left of Mahomes. Knowing the Patriots would send their safety to Hill&rsquo;s side of the field, Andy Reid essentially schemed things so that Kelce would only be guarded by one defensive back. It didn&rsquo;t take long for Travis to win his match-up and catch the ball for a touchdown.</p>

<p>One thing that&rsquo;s becoming clear to me as I watch the Chiefs this quarter is that Bob Sutton finally made some adjustments on defense to slow down the Patriots&rsquo; rushing attack. Sutton now has three of his men lining up as tackles along the middle of the line of the scrimmage. It&rsquo;s much harder for the Patriots to gain any leverage in runs now. However, the additional reinforcement along th edefensive line comes at the expense of the linebackers&rsquo; corps - instead of fielding two players as conventional linebackers, the Chiefs now only field only one player behind their defensive linemen.</p>

<p>On the last play of the 3rd quarter, Mahomes missed Kelce on what would have been a fairly easy touchdown. To be fair though, his target was open as well, but that throw was significantly more difficult to make. Kelce literally ran across the formation into empty space behind two other receivers running their routes. A simple lob in his direction was all that was needed for a touchdown on that play.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hits on Mahomes: 3</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="4th-quarter">4th Quarter</h4>

<p>Watching the 4th quarter, it&rsquo;s clearly becoming evident to me that the Chiefs defensive line is turning into a vulnerability. The problem with the Chiefs is that the line is only capable of two modes - run stopping mode and pass rush mode. When the line tightens up with bigger bodies towards the middle, the Chiefs become effective defensing the run, but the pass rush loses its teeth. When the line widens into a more traditional four-man look and the Chiefs have all their stud defensive linemen out there, Kansas becomes effective rushing the passer, but then the rush defense loses virtually all of its efficacy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s dawning on me that I overrated this Chiefs defensive line. After all, what good is a phenomenal pass rush if the defensive line and the linebackers behind them are completely inept in containing opposing rushers? Therefore, any analysis I conduct in the future on a playoff team&rsquo;s defense has to account for their ability to stop the run with their box players.</p>

<p>By the way, if I haven&rsquo;t mentioned this before, then I&rsquo;ll bring it up here - Sony Michel has played mostly terrific this game. His decision making  and cuts have been on point so far. It appears the rookie is finally realizing some of that first-round potential.</p>

<p>Following the Patriots giving the ball up on downs several minutes into the fourth quarter, the Chiefs had an opportunity to finally gain some momentum. All they needed was a successful drive from their offense that ends in some points. But what we get instead is a three-and-out. A failed run on first down and two poor passes from Mahomes put a quick kibosh on the drive. Really, Mahomes is worrying me here. It&rsquo;s clear as hell that the Patriots were in a Cover-0 formation on 3rd down, but the Chiefs signal caller was awkwardly late throwing the ball to Tyreek Hill. Had he recognized that Hill was in a position to exploit the defense immediately after the snap, he could have actually moved the chains here with a quick sideways pass to Hill.</p>

<p>The Chiefs catch another break, as an errant pass by Brady results in an interception. On the second play, Reid finally dialed up a beautiful play, moving Mahomes to the right only to have him throw the ball against the grain to the left side of the field to a wide open Damien Williams. Running behind three offensive linemen, the rookie rusher sauntered into the end zone.</p>

<p>With the Chiefs now ahead, the opportunity is there to close out the game. And now, <strong><em>finally</em></strong>, the Chiefs opt to play some good defense. Aggressive press coverage against the Patriots receivers forces Brady to hold on to the ball a touch longer. Unfortunately, the pass rush is unable to hit home. Granted, you have a few players coming close here and there, but Brady still has far too much time in the pocket to breathe comfortably. It&rsquo;s worth noting Chris Jones is sidelined at this point with injury, so the only stud rushers lining up along the line are Justin Houston and Dee Ford. Still, neither one  of these two are slouches, so Kansas shouldn&rsquo;t be having much issue nailing Brady. The problem is that these defenders are being chipped or outright  stone-walled by multiple Patriot blockers. As a result, neither of these edge rushers are unable to even work the pocket until it&rsquo;s too late. The coaches aren&rsquo;t helping much either - neither Houston nor Ford are straying from their wide-nine position. Edge blitzes aren&rsquo;t being called much either.</p>

<p>It also hurts that Tom Brady is playing his best football to close out the game. Without much of a rushing game to carry the offense, the team vested their faith in Brady&rsquo;s arm. And that trust paid off tremendously, as Brady made some key throws to receivers like Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan and Rob Gronkowski to keep the chains moving. Within the red zone, the Patriots were able to count on Sony Michel punching the ball across the goal line on two separate occasions.</p>

<p>The Chiefs answered back with their own scores and a field goal to tie the game up, but a favorable coin toss put the ball back in Brady&rsquo;s hands in overtime. The rest is history. Overtime does not need to be discussed here.</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Rather than list bullet points quickly explaining the Rams victory in the NFC championship game, I&rsquo;ll be doing a deep dive, keeping notes here as I watch coaches&rsquo; film of the game.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="1st-quarter">1st Quarter</h4>

<p>The Saints started out hot, thanks to a smartly executed tight-end screen, Alvin Kamara running wheel routes, and Michael Thomas making catches against tight coverage.</p>

<p>Still&hellip;there were indications the Saints&rsquo; success would be a little unsustainable. First off, Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh were constantly winning battles at the line of scrimmage - the two defensive tackles not only managed to harassed Drew Brees on a few of his pass attempts, but also limited Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram on run plays. Even against six-man boxes, the Rams were able to hold their own against New Orleans&rsquo; rushers thanks to the play of those two key playmakers along the defensive line. Second, Los Angeles wholly committed themselves to double-teaming Michael Thomas whenever possible. Even though Thomas was able to produce in the first quarter, it would only be so long before Los Angeles would finally put the clamps on him.  And without Thomas, the Saints would have no receivers to depend upon in the passing game. Now if Drew Brees was an elite quarterback, he&rsquo;d eventually find other receiving outlets as the game progressed&hellip;but we&rsquo;ll talk more about that later.</p>

<h4 id="2nd-quarter">2nd Quarter</h4>

<p>The Rams offense finally got going after a successful fake punt deep in their half of the field. Immediately after the chains moved, McVay called in some of his best plays and sped up the tempo in order to try and ensure that fake punt would not be in vain. And it worked. The Rams were able to chew off major yardage on this drive. Thanks to McVay&rsquo;s game management, Jared Goff marshaled his offense down the field in a hostile environment. And even though this drive would only result in a field goal, it helped calm him down.</p>

<p>Drew Brees and company would get the ball back only to go three and out. First down was a failed run that was blown up in the back field courtesy of Aaron Donald. On second down, Brees was trying to hit a receiver running a deep dig route behind another skill player running upfield. But Aqib Talib rushed over from his zone on the other side of the field to cut off the dig receiver at the catch point, forcing Brees to pull the ball back and dump the pass off to a tight end in an act of desperation. On third down, the Saints thought they could flare Kamara out behind two skill receivers, but the Rams reacted too quickly and kept him from even catching the ball cleanly.</p>

<p>Brees would get the ball back soon after following a Rams punt. And the drive was looking positive at first&hellip;until Suh and Dante Fowler started wreaking havoc in the backfield. A fresh series of Saints downs began with Suh blowing by the guard to sack Brees for a 6-yard loss. On the next play, Fowler curled around right tackle Ryan Ramcyzk, invading Brees&rsquo; personal space and throwing him into a panicky state that essentially ended any promise the play might have had. 3rd down, the Saints were content waving a white flag and playing for field position instead on the ensuing punt.</p>

<p>The Rams&rsquo; last drive of the half ended successfully in a touchdown. Goff deserves some major credit on this drive - playing against nickel coverage in obvious passing plays, he still led his team down the field, his best moment being a dime pass 36 yards downfield to Brandin Cooks against man coverage. On top of that, the New Orleans pass rushers were simply unable to get any consistent pressure on Goff. The only time Goff felt any heat came on blitzes. The Rams adjusted pretty quickly and called max protection sets to ensure Goff had a bit more time in the pocket.</p>

<p>The quarter had eerie similarities to last week&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="3rd-quarter">3rd Quarter</h4>

<p>The Rams started off on a weak note, striking out on their first drive without even gaining a single yard. The Saints, on the other hand, came out strong. Some adjustments are obvious here:</p>

<ul>
<li>No longer are the Saints halfbacks running headlong towards Suh and Donald. Most of the run plays were angled away from those two.</li>
<li>Alvin Kamara became the team&rsquo;s bell cow in the pass game. Sean Payton must have noticed the Rams were a little too giddy with the man coverage on the back end of their defense. Which means coming out of the backfield, Kamara would almost always find himself matched up against a linebacker. Brees was more than happy exploiting that obvious mismatch.</li>
</ul>

<p>The drive ended in a touchdown. The Rams were put in a bad spot - crap out on the next drive and the Saints would have seized all the momentum in the game. But Goff and Brandin Cooks saw to it that their team wouldn&rsquo;t fall too far behind. When the Rams offense stepped back out onto the field, the two connected on three big passes. The Saints&rsquo; coverage defenders were simply unable to keep pace with Cooks. Eli Apple and Marshon Lattimore didn&rsquo;t even bother pressing the speedster at the line of scrimmage. And in a zone look on one play, not one Saint could track Cooks as he scurried behind his offensive linemen on a bootleg release. Speaking of which, the Saints defensive front fell way too hard for the bootleg on two different occasions, leaving Goff way too comfortable to air the ball out to Cooks.  No surprise then that Los Angeles came away with a touchdown to keep this game within three points.</p>

<p>The Saints started the ensuing drive on a very positive note, moving the chains twice. Then Aaron Donald blew up two consecutive plays to put the Saints into a long 3rd down situation. Given that the referees in the game were content letting defensive backs mug receivers in coverage, it&rsquo;s not much of a surprise that the Saints failed to convert against aggressive man coverage. Once again, the Rams defensive line forced another punt out of the Saints.</p>

<h4 id="4th-quarter">4th Quarter</h4>

<p>The last three drives stand out in this quarter. On the third-to-last drive, Goff was sensational on two big passes, including one on a long scramble out of the pocket. It&rsquo;s clear New Orleans had no respect for Goff&rsquo;s mobility - the third-year quarterback made them pay dearly for that disrespect here. Now this drive should have ended in a touchdown, but Sean McVay made the unusual move of not chancing a goal-line push on 4th and 1. Apparently, the man was content simply notching the game into a tie at that point. I&rsquo;m not happy with the decision - the playoffs reward those coaches that make bold wagers. With only one yard to go, McVay needed to show confidence in his offense at that moment.</p>

<p>On the next drive, the Saints desperately needed some positive gains to score and, more importantly, close out the game without giving the ball back to the Rams. After a desperation lob to Alvin Kamara to move the chains, Drew Brees hooked up with Ted Ginn on a huge throw to put the Saints in position for an easy field goal. But then the next play may have been proof positive of something a few astute analysts have noted - Brees has lost some of his magic recently. The veteran passer was simply supposed to complete an easy pass to Michael Thomas on the next down. It was a play designed to keep the clock moving and throw the Rams defense off.</p>

<p>But the throw was <em>limp</em>. It was <em>weak</em>. So weak that even the sure-handed Thomas couldn&rsquo;t reel in the ball. It&rsquo;s a damn shame too, as not only did the clock stop, but the Saints lost a down at such a critical moment. So how did Brees fail to make such an easy pass? Is it possible the man has been dealing with a hidden shoulder injury that&rsquo;s been nagging him over the past few weeks? If so, was that shoulder injury aggravated on that big throw? A silent injury would not only explain his lack of strength on this throw, but it would also shed light on his mundane numbers over the past several weeks. Ever since that great midseason run when the Saints distinguished themselves as the top team in the league, Brees hasn&rsquo;t been sharp. His deep passes lacked touch and whatever rapport he&rsquo;s developed with his secondary receivers was lost.  The Saints were still able to lock themselves in as the top seed of the NFC, but something was off with their star signal caller. An injury would explain things quite nicely. It would also explain why even on that deep pass, the ball was wickedly underthrown.</p>

<p>Anyway, second down was a failed run. Third down ended with an incomplete pass that should have been flagged as defensive pass interference. And even though some people insist that the Saints had the game stolen from the at that very moment, it&rsquo;s clear to me that the Rams were the better team. Even if the referees called that play properly and New Orleans went on to grind the clock out to a Super Bowl berth, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a good win. New Orleans was <strong>clearly</strong> the weaker team in this match-up.</p>

<p>But with some abetting from the referees, the Rams were still in position to contest the result of this team. A touchdown would have resulted in a decisive Rams victory. A field goal would send this game into overtime.  But the Los Angeles offense would need to push the ball at least 40 or so yards down the field to put themselves in position to post points on the board.  Before the game, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect Goff to perform well in such a tense moment. But the man was mostly fantastic, connecting on two big passes to place his team in position for a mid-range field goal. Only way he could have done better is if he threw a cleaner pass towards Robert Woods on a 3rd down conversion. Had he thrown a better ball, it&rsquo;s possible Woods would have motored into the end zone for a touchdown to end the game once and for all. But instead, the Rams settled for a field goal to push the game into extra time.</p>

<h4 id="overtime">Overtime</h4>

<p>Two key things that I&rsquo;ve emphasized time and time again in this analysis once again emerge in the waning minutes of this game - the Rams&rsquo; suffocating defensive line and unexpectedly amazing play from Jared Goff.</p>

<p>The Saints, despite being the first team to possess the ball, was unable to do anything here, as the Rams&rsquo; pass rushers forced Drew Brees into throwing an ugly interception early into the drive. It was a fitting end for a defensive line that dominated the trenches for most of the game.</p>

<p>All Jared Goff and his offense needed was about 20 or so yards to put his team in position to kick a field goal. And the Rams&rsquo; signal caller made fantastic passes against heavy duress. Despite Saints&rsquo; defensive linemen bearing down on him on two separate plays, Goff was still able to complete passes towards his safety valves, putting his team on the cusp of field goal range. McVay, showing some gutsy trust in his kicker, decided to attempt the field goal anyway, knowing that a missed kick would leave his defense in dire straits. But that trust paid off, as Zuerlein was able to kick the ball through the uprights from 57 yards out, effectively kicking his team to the Super Bowl.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>People are making a ruckus over the refs missing an obvious pass interference call against the Saints that would have allowed them to close out the game. And sure, New Orleans has the right to hold a grudge against Bill Vinovich and his crew for years to come&hellip;but it&rsquo;s clear that the Rams were the better team in this contest.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say the Saints were awful from start to finish - New Orleans had sporadic flashes of brilliance, but on most other plays, the team was just stagnant. It&rsquo;s clear Brees is not that great quarterback that was playing at a near-historic level earlier in the season. Something happened to him - it could have been injury, it could have been age finally catching up to him suddenly, it could have been him failing to practice quarterbacking fundamentals late in the season&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know. But the man had no business being considered an elite quarterback.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Ndamukong Suh may have finally broken out as an elite defensive lineman. Before the postseason, I thought Aaron Donald was the only Los Angeles&rsquo; pass rusher worth recognizing as an elite pass rusher. It&rsquo;s clear I was wrong and Suh deserved some recognition as well. Honestly though&hellip;Suh&rsquo;s done little throughout the regular season to justify elite status. It wasn&rsquo;t until the game against Dallas in the divisional round that Ndamukong finally rounded back into top form - maybe playoffs truly brings the very best out of him?</p>

<p>If I could go back in time to readjust the comparison chart I drew up while previewing this game, I&rsquo;d dock a few points away from New Orleans, as Brees could no longer be considered an elite passer. Furthermore, I&rsquo;d add an additional category to the chart to account for pass rushers like Suh and Dante Fowler, pass rushers that did not really impress in the regular season, but could present themselves as game-changers in the playoffs.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Patriots @ Chiefs Preview</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The New England Patriots meet the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium for the AFC Championship game.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Championship Round Analysis - Patriots @ Chiefs.jpg" alt="" />The Patriots have underwhelmed this year compared to years past. On the road this season, the team has only managed three wins. And frankly, only one of those victories came against a quality team.</p>

<p>While the Patriots were able to beat the Chiefs in the regular season, that was a home game against Patrick Mahomes early in the year.  Mahomes has gotten better since then. And frankly, it can even be argued that Kansas City was the better team in that contest - if the Chiefs made more of an effort to cut down on the silly mistakes that game, then we&rsquo;d be talking about a Kansas team with one more victory under its belt this season.</p>

<p>Both teams come into this rematch down a key player on offense. The Chiefs are missing Kareem Hunt coming out of the backfield while the Patriots can no longer count on Josh Gordon catching deep passes. But Kansas City has a promising replacement for Hunt in Damien Williams - the former Dolphin has been racking up some solid numbers over the last several weeks. Meanwhile, New England has yet to find that deep threat capable of replicating Gordon&rsquo;s production. Gronkowski might come the closest to being that player, but age has finally caught up with him this year - the man isn&rsquo;t what he&rsquo;s once been. So if anything, the Chiefs carry the slight edge here in terms of overall offense.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one area where Kansas City can definitively declare an advantage in this match-up, it&rsquo;s on the defensive line. Kansas City has one of the best defensive lines in the league thanks to a trio of elite pass rushers in Chris Jones, Dee Ford, and Justin Houston. So long as the Chiefs&rsquo; secondary can force Tom Brady to hold the ball just a touch longer, I have faith that their defensive front will be harassing the GOAT on a regular basis. And really, if there&rsquo;s a surefire way to throw great quarterbacks off their game, it&rsquo;s relentless pressure on the quarterback. There&rsquo;s a reason I place so much emphasis on the pass rush when analyzing postseason games. It was the Giants key to success in 2007 and 2011, it was Denver&rsquo;s key to success in 2015, and it&rsquo;ll likely serve the same role for Kansas when they win the Super Bowl this year.</p>

<p>As for coaching, I have nothing but high regards for Bill Belichick. But even Belichick can only do so much with what he&rsquo;s given. Yes, he out-coached the royal hell out of Anthony Lynn last week, but Andy Reid is no Anthony Lynn - the man can adjust on the fly. Belichick needs to concoct a fantastic game plan here should he want to take his Patriots to their third consecutive Super Bowl. But given his team&rsquo;s limitations on both sides of the ball, Belichick will find it damn near impossible to devise a winning plan here. So expect the Patriots&rsquo; season to end today.</p>

			<p>The NFC championship will be the Los Angeles Rams visiting the New Orleans Saints in a rematch from the regular-season.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Championship Round Analysis - Rams @ Saints.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Rams finally adjusted and began running the ball more, this time with CJ Anderson as the lead halfback. Gurley was the better rusher last week on a yards-per-rush basis, but CJ Anderson was without doubt the team&rsquo;s bell cow in the run game. And Anderson will need to go off again for his team to have any hope of winning in a hostile Superdome this week.</p>

<p>As I noted last week, it&rsquo;s pointedly difficult to win on the road in the postseason. A team needs to be stacked to have a real chance at winning, and the Rams fall short in that regard. Without Cooper Kupp, Los Angeles is one man down from having at least three reliable weapons on offense. It&rsquo;s a problem made all the more worse when you don&rsquo;t have an elite quarterback that can improvise and function under stressful circumstances - let&rsquo;s be real, Goff isn&rsquo;t that player that can put a team on his back, so he desperately needs some help here. On defense, Los Angeles lacks another pass rusher that can truly compliment Aaron Donald. Donkey Kong Suh was fantastic last week, but he&rsquo;s been unable to play at a consistently high level all throughout the season. I don&rsquo;t foresee him carrying over his success from last week into this game&hellip;unless a silent injury that&rsquo;s been nagging him the whole regular season has been suddenly lifted going into the postseason.</p>

<p>I feel pretty comfortable taking New Orleans here, especially given the competence of their coaching staff.  After the Eagles exploded out of the gate with two consecutive scores last week, the Saints&rsquo; coaches adjusted defensively, rendering Philly&rsquo;s offense impotent for the rest of the game. It takes some damn good coaching to adjust that quickly. So Sean Payton and his crew won some credibility in my eyes that day.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to realize that road teams need to be truly stacked if they&rsquo;re going to be making a run in the postseason. Road teams need an elite quarterback, at least 3 different weapons on offense, and at least 2 stud pass rushers. Quality coaching is a necessity as well, but coaches can only work with the resources they&rsquo;re given.</p>

<p>So anything less than that and a road team will see its offense eventually stalled or its defense eventually victimized in the postseason. You can survive a few road games with talent deficiencies at those key positions, but eventually these road teams will run into astute coaches like Bill Belichick that know how to exploit those deficits.</p>

<p>The Chargers were eaten alive today in New England, mostly because their offense was limited and their defensive pass rush was virtually nonexistent. Belichick worked his magic and schematically shut down Keenan Allen and Melvin Gordon. Without either of those two producing on his offense, Philip Rivers had a hell of a time trying to score points for his team. His will to win is second to none, but the man can only go as far as his options let him. On defense, Joey Bosa revealed his true colors as a bust. I made a mistake considering him elite. It was an assumption rooted in his performance from last year, but injuries have rendered him rather ordinary this season. So without a a second major pass rusher to concern them, the Patriots were able to focus more resources on Melvin Ingram, effectively keeping Brady clean on the vast majority of his snaps.</p>

<p>The Eagles were handled in the Big Easy, as I discussed at length in my post-game comments on that game. What hurt Philly more than their spotty pass rush or questionable coaching calls&hellip;was their limited offense. The Eagles only field two solid weapons at offense. Take the both of them away and Nick Foles was left helpless. It also hurt that some of his passes were criminally under-thrown.</p>

<p>There is one thing that might factor into the road teams&rsquo; favor though - inexperienced quarterbacks. Inexperienced quarterbacks were a major reason we saw 3 road upsets this year in the postseason - all 3 teams that lost at home were fielding quarterbacks making their playoff debut. And it&rsquo;s without question that this inexperience played a major role in at least 2 of those 3 games.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t stop there - go back to 2016, when the Cowboys claimed the top seed in the NFC after a sensational year from their two rookie stars in Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott. But a run wasn&rsquo;t in the cards for the Cowboys that season - Dak was very sluggish in the first half of the playoff game against Green Bay. He made some silly mistakes that allowed Green Bay to run up the score by several touchdowns. The Cowboys tried to stage a comeback in the second half, but thanks to some heroics from Aaron Rodgers, it was a little too late.</p>

<p>So road teams can be helped in that regard, but experience becomes a moot issue in the championship round and the Super Bowl. Once again, for a road team to win the Super Bowl, there is absolutely no question that the team has to be stacked.</p>

			<p>The Saints have bested the defending champions and have one more game to play before their trip to the Super Bowl. But first a couple thoughts&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the 3rd quarter, the Saints sustained a drive that lasted 11 and a half minutes. 11 and a half fucking minutes. It was amazing. It was a grueling crawl down the field, but the Saints were finally able to punch one past the goal line after 18 plays. Philadelphia needs to be admonished here, because the defensive line was completely walled during the whole drive. Had any of the pass rushers hit home just one or two more times, it might have been enough to prevent the Saints from posting 7 more points on board.</p></li>

<li><p>That being said, the Eagles&rsquo; pass rushers did have their moments from time to time. Arguably, it was thanks to the pass rush that the Eagles were able to stage one final drive to seize the game away from New Orleans. Unfortunately, that drive ended in a horrendous miscue from their top receiver, Alshon Jeffery. On top of that, the Eagles defensive line was absolutely vicious in the first half, stuffing runs at the line of scrimmage and haranguing Brees on a regular basis.</p></li>

<li><p>The biggest thing here is that the Eagles offense stalled from the second quarter onwards. After surrendering two touchdowns on defense early in the game, the Saints must have made a few adjustments on defense. From the second quarter onward, Philadelphia&rsquo;s longest drive lasted only 2 and a half minutes. One of the adjustments I did see happen involved putting the clamps on Alshon Jeffery by having Marshon Lattimore trail him in coverage. Marshon&rsquo;s physical dimensions actually make him better suited to defend jump-ball catchers like Jeffery.</p></li>

<li><p>But the reason why the Eagles ultimately stalled is because the offense was not dynamic enough. Even though Golden Tate shined last week, I was right in my initial assessment of him and other depth receivers on this team - Philly doesn&rsquo;t have anybody else that could solidly compliment the likes of Zach Ertz and Alshon Jeffery. Take those two players away and Nick Foles found himself holding on to the ball way too long for his own good.</p></li>
</ul>

			<p>It&rsquo;s only halftime, but the Patriots are going to win this one. The game was over by the 2-minute warning in the first half.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Patriots are once again putting on a coaching clinic here. New England saw Los Angeles&rsquo; putting smaller bodies out there to defend the flat and decided that these smaller defenders would have trouble handling crushing runs right up the middle.</p></li>

<li><p>Outside of a single batted pass, Ingram and Bosa have been blanked in the first half. It&rsquo;s not easy dealing with the Patriots and their clever use of misdirection and quick passes, but both edge rushers have had opportunities to make their presence known and neither player has taken advantage of those opportunities. I think I&rsquo;ve been too generous classifying Bosa as an elite edge rusher. The reality is that he&rsquo;s not the same agent of havoc from last year.</p></li>

<li><p>The Chargers&rsquo; zone defense is worthless so long as the defensive front cannot muster any pressure. Elite quarterbacks like Brady will sit back and pick apart zone schemes.</p></li>

<li><p>It alarms me that this Los Angeles team that&rsquo;s getting so badly out-coached this game is the same team that dominated against the Ravens last week. It indicates to me that the Ravens sucked more on offense than I thought. Either that or run-first offenses can be easily stunted, especially if you&rsquo;re played that rush-heavy offense earlier in the season.</p></li>
</ul>

			<p>The Philadelphia Eagles return to New Orleans in their quest to repeat as champions.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Division Round Analysis - Eagles @ Saints.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Eagles do not deserve to be such crazy underdogs in this match-up.  I know, I know Philadelphia was shellacked earlier in the year when these two teams met in the Superdome&hellip;but the postseason is different from the regular season. In the regular season, teams ebb and flow. And the Eagles were clearly trending down that week while the Saints were staking their claim as the cream of the crop in the NFC. Besides, Nick Foles wasn&rsquo;t even playing in that game!</p>

<p>Philadelphia has the more complete team while New Orleans has home field advantage. Yes, that&rsquo;s right&hellip;Philadelphia enters this contest with the better overall roster. Even though both teams only have two players on their offense worthy of being tagged as reliable offensive weaponry, the Eagles have more serviceable depth on that side of the ball compared to the Saints. Last week against the Bears, Golden Tate finally started proving his worth, catching 5 passes off 8 targets, including 1 reception for the game-winning touchdown. On top of that, Nelson Agholor has had a few brilliant moments over the past few weeks, especially on deep catches. As for the Saints, they don&rsquo;t really have many potentially solid depth receivers behind Michael Thomas. Only Tre&rsquo;Quan Smith has shown flashes here and there over the season, but it remains to be seen whether the rookie can contribute meaningfully in big-time situations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, compare the defensive lines on both teams. The Saints have two promising players lining up alongside Cameron Jordan - Sheldon Rankins and Marcus Davenport. But unlike Jordan, neither can be considered elite pass rushers this season. Meanwhile, the Eagles have three great pressure rushers, two of which I&rsquo;ve already classified as elite - Michael Bennett and Fletcher Cox. And it&rsquo;s vey debatable as to whether Chris Long should be considered a top-tier edge rusher as well. His pressure numbers would certainly justify such classification.</p>

<p>Coaching is a wash here, as both Sean Payton and Doug Pederson are great coaches, so neither team can claim an advantage there. So honestly, the spread for this game should be set far closer than what the books have listed. My biggest bet of the weekend will be on the Eagles spread. And in fact, Philadelphia can also win this game too, but only if the Eagles defensive linemen are able to consistently win the battle at the line of scrimmage. If the Saints defensive linemen have more of an impact than their Philly counterparts, the Saints should then start booking flights to the Super Bowl after the game ends.</p>
