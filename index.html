	<div class='postTitle'>Chargers @ Patriots - Division Round Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Chargers fly again to the east coast this weekend, this time to contend against the New England Patriots.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Division Round Analysis - Chargers @ Patriots.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Chargers nearly have a complete team. And it puts them in position to pull off an upset here. New England can still win this game, but it will not be easy. Los Angeles comes into this game with the superior pass rush, headlined by Melvin Ingram and Joey Bosa. I expect Tom Brady to be harangued regularly.</p>

<p>Hunter Henry also makes his season debut in this game. While his snap count will be limited, Henry could have a major impact, as the Chargers are missing that dependable tight end that can run all sorts of routes from the book-ends of the offensive line. Antonio Gates has been trying his best to fulfill that role this year, but age has caught up to him. It is worth noting though&hellip;that Gates was simply fantastic last game against the Ravens. His receptions on third down kept the chains moving on 3 of the Chargers&rsquo; scoring drives. Rivers came to rely on Gates more than Keenan Allen on third downs! So if anything, Los Angeles has some legitimate hope at the tight-end position - if Gates and Henry can work in tandem to provide Philip Rivers a reliable target at tight end, then Los Angeles winning is a very <em>very</em> real possibility.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not ready to crown Los Angeles as the favorite here. New England still deserves to be the favorite in this game. For all their shortcomings this year, the Patriots do have one thing that the Chargers don&rsquo;t have - the best head coach in the game. Bill Belichick is a legend. And I&rsquo;m not sure if Anthony Lynn is ready to match wits with Belichick. To his credit though, Lynn and his defensive coordinator Gus Bradley drafted a phenomenal game plan against the Ravens last week. So if anything, I&rsquo;ll be treating this game as the real litmus test to determine how far Anthony Lynn has come along the last few years as head coach. To be honest, I had little faith in the man before the season started. But this year&rsquo;s Chargers are a different beast, and the man needs to be given his due for the team&rsquo;s resurgence this season.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Rams over Cowboys - Post-Game Thoughts</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Some thoughts on the Rams first playoff win in the Sean McVay era&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Finally, the Rams have returned to their old successful ways from earlier in the season. With a healthier Todd Gurley and CJ Anderson finally brought up to speed on McVay&rsquo;s playbook, Los Angeles was able to pound the ball on the turf for 273 yards.</p></li>

<li><p>Being able to run the ball also opened up that other thing McVay loves to call - the crossing routes. And really, the man coverage schemes that Dallas runs on defense are mighty susceptible to those types of routes, especially if the linebackers are too preoccupied defending the run. As I expected, Jason Garrett and Rod Marinelli were averse to shifting defenders into zone coverage, even if playing zone would have put the defensive backs in better position this game.</p></li>

<li><p>Neither team was able to mount much of a pass rush, but the Rams&rsquo; defensive linemen generally saw more success than their Cowboys&rsquo; counterparts. Aaron Donald had his moments, as did Ndamukong Suh and Dante Fowler. Collectively, the defensive line&rsquo;s best play came on a 4th down late in the game, when Ezekiel Elliott was stuffed at the line of scrimmage.</p></li>

<li><p>Home field advantage is a hell of a thing sometimes. It&rsquo;s pretty clear the Rams were gifted a touchdown late in the game - the referees did not call holding on a Los Angeles offensive lineman that was pretty damn clearly holding a Cowboys defensive end illegally. Had the game been played in Dallas, I think the referees would have been bold enough to throw that flag.</p></li>
</ul>

	<div class='postTitle'>Chiefs over Colts - Quick Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Just a few points to make about the Chiefs and their division round victory over the Colts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Any doubts I may have had about the Chiefs&rsquo; championship prospects have been quieted. All 3 of their star pass rushers made their presence known throughout the game. Mahomes played with some admirable composure in his first real postseason game. The running game came back alive behind Damien Williams. If the run game stays alive, Kansas City is easily the most complete team alive in the postseason.</p></li>

<li><p>The penalty bug seems to have passed from Houston over to Indianapolis. The Colts committed so many silly pre-snap penalties, some of which sustained key scoring drives for the Chiefs.</p></li>

<li><p>Andrew Luck and the offense seem&hellip;discombobulated? It looks to me that the Colts lost that offensive mojo that so many people and gamblers found so endearing. Andrew Luck had trouble connected with all of his major playmakers, especially T.Y. Hilton. Maybe Hilton&rsquo;s injuries finally caught up with him today? Or maybe it was the cold weather and snowy conditions that threw the Colts off into disarray.</p></li>
</ul>

	<div class='postTitle'>Cowboys @ Rams - Division Round Preview</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Ladyboys travel to Los Angeles to face off against the second-seeded Rams.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Division Round Analysis - Cowboys @ Rams.jpg" alt="" />The Rams are justifiably the favorites here. In all categories outside of coaching and home field advantage, the Cowboys manage draw even against Los Angeles. But it&rsquo;s that latter exception that should concern Dallas. Jason Garrett is still a questionable coach, especially on the road. His refusal to incorporate his quarterback&rsquo;s mobility into his offense is idiotic. The Cowboys desperately need another dimension of offense early in the year, but Garrett and offensive coordinator Scott Linehan simply refused to leverage the speed of their Dak Prescott&rsquo;s running ability. Even with Amari Cooper factored into things here, the Cowboys need more diversity on offense should they want to survive road playoff games. Now I did see Dak execute a few designed run plays last week against the Seahawks, but I still doubt whether Garrett truly wants his captain on offense running around.</p>

<p>Besides that, Jason Garrett made a few other questionable decisions over the course of the season. His refusal to be bold on 4th down at various points through the season, his willingness to play most of his starters the last week of the regular season&hellip;it&rsquo;s made me doubt him.</p>

<p>On the other side, you have Sean McVay, who has done a yeoman&rsquo;s work in hiding his quarterback&rsquo;s deficiencies for much of the season. Jared Goff has some fantastic statistics this season, but his games in Chicago and against Philadelphia have shown me that the second-year player has some notable drawbacks in his play. Without the benefit of a strong run game and playing from behind, the man wilts from the pressure. Todd Gurley is more important to the offense than Jared Goff, simply put. I don&rsquo;t mean to minimize Goff&rsquo;s role here, but Gurley is the foundational piece that motivates the entire offense.</p>

<p>So this game seems to have come down home field advantage and coaching, and I&rsquo;d much rather side with the wunderkind and Wade Phillips over Jason Garrett and his ilk.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Division Round Preview - Colts @ Chiefs</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>An exciting rematch of a thriller from not too long ago, when Andrew Luck staged one of the greatest postseason comebacks in history.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Division Round Analysis - Colts @ Chiefs.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So this is a very interesting match. Both teams have distinct advantages over one another. The Chiefs are rolling into the contest with 3 elite pass rushers and home field advantage. The Colts, meanwhile, come to Arrowhead Stadium with the more experienced quarterback and a more dynamic offense.</p>

<p>On coaching, you have a coach of the year candidate in Frank Reich versus Skinny himself, Andy Reid. Reid is a fantastic coach - his coaching tree is a testament to his brilliance as a head coach. But the problem is that the man has had a losing record in the playoffs dating back to 2008. Just the past couple years alone, the Chiefs have only posted a pathetic 1-4 record in the postseason. Their lone playoff win came against a Texans team led by a second-string quarterback and an idiot coach. So it&rsquo;s fair to say that Kansas City has yet to win a truly meaningful playoff game under Reid, leaving many people convinced that Andy is simply unable to shepherd a team through the postseason.</p>

<p>However in his defense, Reid never had an elite quarterback since he assumed control of the Chiefs back in 2013. Even in his best year, Alex Smith was nothing more than a second-tier quarterback. Mahomes actually presents an exciting opportunity for Reid here - for the first time, the Chiefs can now execute any play Andy draws up, as the team is no longer limited at quarterback. So if anything, <strong><em>this year</em></strong> is the real litmus test as to whether Andy Reid is doomed to fail in the playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Colts actually stand a good shot at upsetting the top-seeded Chiefs here, given their offensive advantages. It&rsquo;s weird to think that the Chiefs are short-handed at offense given some of their performances this season, but ever since the team forced Kareem Hunt out, Kansas has not been able to find that third option that can provide an added dimension to the offense. That being said, if Patrick Mahomes is able to shake off any postseason jitters early into the game, the Chiefs should carry this game and advance toward the conference championships. How fast it will take the presumptive MVP to ward off nerves depends in part on Andy Reid&rsquo;s ability to manage his star player&rsquo;s emotions. So this is your moment to shine, Andy.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Eagles over Bears - Quick Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Some quick points&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Incredibly hard-fought match. I would say Matt Nagy out-coached Doug Pederson here. Lining Allen Robinson up over cornerback Avonte Maddox and having him run double moves on the young defensive back yielded big gains in the pass game. The Eagles took a little too long to fix that issue.</p></li>

<li><p>Mitch Trubisky handled his nerves well. He threw two bad throws early on that should have been picked if the Eagles&rsquo; cornerbacks were just a bit more sure-handed. One of those passes could have actually been returned by the Eagles for a defensive touchdown. Still, it&rsquo;s clear to me that whatever jitters he may have had were shaken off by the end of the second quarter.</p></li>

<li><p>The Eagles&rsquo; pass rush was limp on most plays. I understand the Eagles were deathly concerned about Trubisky&rsquo;s tendency to scramble wildly, but not much emphasis was placed on even pressuring the young quarterback. From what I noticed, the Eagles were too content just bull rushing the pocket and sending only four men to rush the passer. Trubisky was way too comfortable in the pocket at times. Bull rushes only work on offensive lines that flat out suck. The Bears have one of the best offensive lines in the league and it seems as if Philadelphia&rsquo;s brain trust wasn&rsquo;t aware of that.</p></li>
</ul>

			<p>Some quick points&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For once, I was right on the money with my quick little analysis. Lamar Jackson&rsquo;s inexperience held him back for most of the game.</p></li>

<li><p>More importantly, the Chargers drafted a much better game plan in this rematch. Los Angeles dedicated so many more defensive resources to the run this time around. The SuperChargers were daring the Ravens to throw the ball and Lamar Jackson simply shriveled up under the postseason spotlight.</p></li>

<li><p>Melvin Ingram had his way with the offensive line here. Joey Bosa had his moments as well, particular when lining up against the guards/center. But Ingram was fantastic. The Ravens seemed almost powerless against him.</p></li>

<li><p>The Ravens&rsquo; best moments on offense came towards the end, where Lamar was forced into constant passing situations. Not only did Lamar have an easier time throwing the ball against prevent defense schemes, but the uptempo pace also helped to slow down that Chargers pass rush.</p></li>
</ul>

			<p>So the first two games are done and I&rsquo;m technically 1-1. While I was <strong>horrifically</strong> off in my assessment of the Colts-Texans game, the Seahawks managed to cover the spread in the last minutes of the game. But in all honesty, I deserve to be 0-2. Had the Seahawks not lost their kicker to injury at the end of the first half, Seattle would likely have lost by 3 points instead of 2 points. Instead, they opted to go a two-point conversion after their last touchdown, as Pete Carroll had no confidence in the backup kicker.</p>

<p>I was initially using a points system to compare teams that were going against one another. That points system hasn&rsquo;t been documented here, but honestly, it was a bit too complicated for its own good. Clearly, it&rsquo;s no good&hellip;the system actually anticipated the Texans to win big today. But come game time, it was the Colts taking the wood to Houston instead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use another system that compares teams to one another among different categories. Each category is equally weighted to one another - no one category takes precedence when determining which team is more likely to win.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to revise my picks for tomorrow using this new system.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="chargers-ravens-3">Chargers @ Ravens (-3)</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/Wild Card Analysis - Chargers @ Ravens.jpg" alt="" />The Chargers and Ravens are fairly even here. Whereas the Chargers claim an advantage here in terms of quarterbacking experience/performance, the Ravens have the better set of offensive weapons as well as home field advantage. The game plans each team draws up will be critical in determining the win. Given that the Chargers are being given 3 points&hellip;I&rsquo;ll go with the Chargers here.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Chargers (+3)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="eagles-bears-6-5">Eagles @ Bears (-6.5)</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/Wild Card Analysis - Eagles @ Bears.jpg" alt="" />By my estimation, the Bears have nothing over the Eagles outside of home field advantage. The Eagles carry two categories here though - quarterback performance and playoff experience. Given that the two teams draw even in every other category, the Eagles should not only cover the spread, but also win the game.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Eagles (+6.5) &amp; Eagles (ML)</strong></p>
