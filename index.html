	<div class='postTitle'>Week 8 - Early Thoughts</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'><p>Time to give out some quick thoughts on the slate of games for the eighth week of the regular season&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="philadelphia-eagles-london-jaguars-3">Philadelphia Eagles @ London Jaguars (+3)</h5>

<p>If this was taking place in Philadelphia, I would giddily take the Eagles, even if the spread was inflated up to 6.5 points in their favor.</p>

<p>But London has a sort of rejuvenating effect on these Jaguars and especially on Blake Bortles. And that may be enough to overcome the coaching and quarterbacking deficits the Jaguars face here in this particular match-up.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: None</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="ravens-panthers-2">Ravens @ Panthers (+2)</h5>

<p>Not sure yet. I need to watch the game between the Ravens and the Saints to see how Baltimore&rsquo;s defense game-planned against a legitimate offense. I also need to study up more on Cam Newton&rsquo;s progress as a pocket passer under the tutelage of Norv Turner.</p>

<p>But it is tempting to side with a solid team that&rsquo;s a home underdog.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: Slightly Panthers</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="browns-steelers-8">Browns @ Steelers (-8)</h5>

<p>So tempting to take the Steelers here. The Browns are so awfully coached. Hue Jackson is just horrendous at his job - his criticism of his <strong>own</strong> offense in last week&rsquo;s loss against the Buccaneers was damn near comical.</p>

<p>But the Steelers need to steal away more than a touchdown here to cover the spread, and it is a bit risky laying so many points with a team that&rsquo;s not quite so elite.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: Slightly Steelers</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="broncos-chiefs-10">Broncos @ Chiefs (-10)</h5>

<p>Another tempting favorite here. The Broncos are coached by a dead man walking in Vance Joseph. And playing away from their home field <em>should</em> impact their play considerably, but their recent performance at Arizona seems to say otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: Slightly Chiefs</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="jets-bears-7">Jets @ Bears (-7)</h5>

<p>Way too many points being laid by a team led by Mitch Trubisky. Then again, I&rsquo;m having a hard time siding with a team led by a rookie quarterback that seems to struggle mightily against above-average defenses.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: None</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="redskins-giants-pk">Redskins @ Giants (PK)</h5>

<p>The Giants seem much more concerned about attaching price tags to their players than actually trying to salvage the damn season. At this point, I would say Jay Gruden is the better coach as of now. Likewise, Alex Smith is a better quarterback compared to Eli Manning, a fact that pains the hell out of me to even admit. If a pick is made here, then i think I&rsquo;d have to pick the team with better people at the biggest positions and more upside in general.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: Redskins</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="seahawks-lions-3">Seahawks @ Lions (-3)</h5>

<p>Interesting match-up here. Something about games where both teams are good make you want to bet on them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d lean a little towards the Lions, but my understanding of both teams is limited, to be honest.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: None</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="buccaneers-bengals-4-5">Buccaneers @ Bengals (-4.5)</h5>

<p>Tempted to go with the Bengals, despite their pathetic showing last week in primetime. The Buccaneers cannot be trusted so long as Jameis remains their quarterback. The pass rushers stepped up, even without star Gerald McCoy being on the field - Carl Nassib in particular showed up to play against the team that spurned him in the offseason.</p>

<p>But their emotional showing last week may leave them a little fatigued against a team that will be looking to play better after a humiliating showing last week.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: Bengals</strong></p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 7 - Supercontest Picks</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'><p>And here we are, after a 3-1-1 showing last week in the Supercontest. I actually feel good, even though my odds of landing in the money are pretty damn slim at this point. Still, let&rsquo;s see if we can hit at least 4 wins this week. So with that said, let&rsquo;s proceed with my picks.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="browns-buccaneers-3">Browns @ Buccaneers (-3)</h5>

<p>A little hard for me to put top American dollar on Jameis Winston, but the Buccaneers have too much of an offensive edge over the Browns here, despite the recent emergence of Baker Mayfield as the franchise quarterback the Browns have sought for generations now. Mayfield is still a rookie finding his sea legs, and he hasn&rsquo;t had much help as of late given that his receiving weapons have been letting him down recently. On top of that, the team is managed by the worst coach in the league in Foo Jackson, and I&rsquo;d be shocked if he actually made some serious adjustments to try and rectify his team&rsquo;s offensive woes.</p>

<p>The reality is that the Buccaneers are simply better coached and better able to produce yards compared to the Browns. Now I know, I know&hellip;.that defense. That defense can&rsquo;t stop leaves blowing gently in the wind, let alone professional NFL offenses. But with that being said, the firing of Mike Smith on Monday may be the impetus this defense needs to actually step up and perform well, if only for one week. A decent man lost his job because of their sorry performance, and that cannot sit well with them.</p>

<p>One more thing worth noting&hellip;Jameis Winston showed some maturity after being slammed down roughly by a Falcon defender last week. Instead of stoking hostilities, Winston was actually holding one of his linemen back from starting a violent confrontation. So I do think Jameis may be trending in the right direction this year.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="titans-6-5-chargers-london">Titans (+6.5) @ Chargers (<em>London</em>)</h5>

<p>The Titans were humiliated in wicked fashion last week in their shut-out loss against the Ravens. Nothing illustrates the magnitude of their loss better than the fact that Tennessee gave up 11 sacks while only completing 10 passes. Savage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Chargers are fresh off a dominant win over the Browns. Not only were the Chargers fairly proficient on offense last week, but that defensive line finally found its groove again, racking up nine hits on Baker Mayfield.</p>

<p>That being said&hellip;the Elo model is in love with the Titans here. And I understand why. The Chargers stock is at a season high, whereas the Titans stock is at a season low. If let-down spots are truly a thing in the National Football League, then this may be one such spot for the Chargers. Especially as I have serious doubts about Anthony Lynn&rsquo;s ability to coach his team to succeed consistently. Its during weeks like these when coaching becomes really critical. And the second-year head coach will be challenged to keep his team level-headed as they travel across several time zones to a foreign land full of distracting tourist locales. Add in a Titans team smarting from a ugly loss and don&rsquo;t be surprised to see the Titans be in contention throughout this entire game.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="vikings-3-jets">Vikings (-3) @ Jets</h5>

<p>As I write this, the Vikings are actually sitting as 3.5-point favorites. Initially, I was feeling the Jets in this spot. The Elo model seemed to be siding with New York too, as they were coming off two solid wins. Even though people think of this Minnesota team as a defensive powerhouse, I have always maintained that these Vikings were an overrated bunch. Their embarrassing showing against the <em>Josh Allen-led Bills</em> and then their defense getting routed by the Rams offense&hellip;both of those outcomes were signs that these Vikings were more average than good.</p>

<p>But then when I look at this game from a contrarian perspective&hellip;I realized the Vikings have had their good moments this season as well. Even though that defense was shellacked against Los Angeles three weeks ago, the offense was keeping pace with the Rams&rsquo; electric offense. Then came a statement win against the Eagles, despite Cousins finding himself constantly beset from Philadelphia&rsquo;s pass rush. And after that came an easy win over a team that frankly had no business contending against Minnesota.</p>

<p>What really sells me here on Minnesota is the coaching match-up here. Mike Zimmer has a tendency to frustrate rookie quarterbacks with false looks and last-second movement. Even though Darnold has had a few good weeks now, the fact remains that he&rsquo;s still a rookie quarterback cutting his teeth in the big leagues. Carson Wentz was doing solid as a rookie too, up until the Vikings finally dismantled him. I expect Darnold to suffer the same fate.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="bills-7-5-colts">Bills (+7.5) @ Colts</h5>

<p>This may well be my favorite pick of the week, which is a little unnerving - I try not to rely on bottom-feeders when I place my bets. But the Bills are contending against a scum-tier Colts team that&rsquo;s not performing nearly as well as their final scores may indicate. Despite them falling only eight points short against the Jets, New York easily had wrist control for most of that match, courtesy of several miscues from the Colts&rsquo; offense.</p>

<p>To be frank, those miscues show me that these Colts are a goddamned mess without the sure-handed T.Y. Hilton. Luckily for them, the man is expected to step back into action this week. But Buffalo has the defensive caliber to keep him bottled up for most of the game.</p>

<p>Really, when people pick against the Bills, they do so for their complete lack of offensive prowess. But here&rsquo;s some good news - a fresh face steps in this week to helm the offense. Derek Anderson may only have four career starts over the past five years, but the Bills may benefit from him being a bit of an X-factor. Not much tape is out there on him - the Indianapolis defense will not be entirely too certain what to expect. Yes, I know the Colts run a fairly bland defensive scheme anyway given their lack of truly talented personnel. Still, Indy&rsquo;s defense will have to play more conservatively as they feel out Derek Anderson on his foray back into football&hellip;and that will only help Buffalo here.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="cowboys-2-redskins">Cowboys (+2) @ Redskins</h5>

<p>The Cowboys have finally rejuvenated themselves last Sunday against one of the better defenses in the league. Sure, I may be a bit biased, but the Cowboys were my sleeper pick for the Super Bowl, in part because of the defense&rsquo;s elite potential. The defense has certainly lived up to my high expectations, but the offense has been completely <em>flaccid</em>. And I truly mean flaccid in every sense of the word - watching Dallas try and pass the ball makes me floppy down there. The air game is absolutely pathetic - Cole Beasley is the only true receiver worth his salt on the roster, and the guy is arguably a poor man&rsquo;s Julian Edelman.</p>

<p>It took <a href="https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/7271421184005/2015/1/e58865d5770cc4c54aa514fdd1ccde20/Jason-Garrett-Dallas-Cowboys-nearing-5-year-deal.jpg" title="The Clapper">The Clapper</a> (thank you, Michael Lombardi) a few eons, but the man and offensive coordinator Scott Linehan finally found a way to spark this offense - let Dak run. By letting Dak Prescott run the ball at will, the offense incorporated another dimension to their game plan. Combined with a strong ground game, the offense actually looked somewhat competent last week. Not all of the Cowboys problems were solved (the passing game is still anemic outside of Cole Beasley), but the team has shown considerable progress.</p>

<p>That being said, the Redskins are not a bad team either, though their win last week was rather weak. Even after turning the ball over three times and effectively abandoning their ground game, Carolina fell just several yards short of mounting a successful comeback. Washington&rsquo;s saving grace was its strong start combined with the Panthers lazily stumbling out of the gate coming off a bye. Sure, Jay Gruden deserves some credit for some smart playcalling on Washington&rsquo;s final drive, but I expected a better overall performance from the Redskins coming off an embarrassing primetime defeat. So that being said, I&rsquo;m expecting a bit of a letdown from Washington that will be further exacerbated by the Cowboys and their unrelenting pass rush.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>49ers @ Packers - Quick Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'><p>Here&rsquo;s the story of how I lost a couple units betting on what I thought would be <em>easy money</em>. As degenerate gamblers like myself learn time and time and time again&hellip;the NFL does not provide many opportunities for <em>easy money</em>.</p>

<p>To be fair, it was a solid game, considering people were expecting a slow-developing blowout. Through the first half, the 49ers actually managed to scrounge up a total of 24 points - a complete shocker considering the books had their <strong>final</strong> score set around 17 points. As the second half began, I saw the live line for their total score was actually set at 32.5 points. Three minutes into the third quarter, the total shifted 1 point downward (to 31.5) as the Packers managed to cap a drive with a field goal.</p>

<p>Think about that&hellip;31.5 points? Only 31.5 points?!? The 49ers already posted 24 points on the board. All they needed was a single touchdown and a lousy field goal to soar past that total. The Niners should be able to round up those points easily given the way they were chewing off yardage in the first half. Even if the Packers defense adjusted a little in the second half, the 49ers should still be able to motor along and collect three field goals over 25-ish minutes of playtime. Seemed like a solid bet, so long as the 49ers carried over their fantastic and aggressive playcalling from the first half.</p>

<p><em>Except they didn&rsquo;t.</em></p>

<p>Just look at the table below - it displays the run/pass split for each of San Francisco&rsquo;s 11 drives.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Week 6 - 49ers Drive Analysis.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The problem might not look all too obvious at first, but some additional context is needed. Look at the extended drives - those drives that feature more than five offensive plays. In the first half, the 49ers only sustained two such drives - the 1st and 6th drives. Notice the run/pass splits are fairly even between both drives. In the second half, the 49ers once again managed only two extended drives - the 7th and 8th drives. The 7th drive was another series where runs and passes were evenly called. Now the 8th drive&hellip;.the 8th drive is the reason why the 49ers lost the game.</p>

<p>Notice that the 49ers committed themselves wholly to the run on that 8th drive? CJ Beathard was called upon to throw the ball only twice through that entire series. It seemed like the 49ers were simply content trying to run the ball the rest of the way and escape Green Bay with a victory. Not necessarily a bad strategy when the end of the game is fast approaching and a team is in the lead. But this drive started <em>at the end of the third quarter.</em> Green Bay still had an entire quarter to stage a comeback&hellip;in a pivotal game that determined the fate of their season. And yet, despite this context&hellip;Kyle Shanahan was all too content running clock before the final quarter even started.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, after that drive, things went awry for San Francisco. CJ Beathard lost all the rhythm he developed from the first eight drives of the game. Come time to try and finally seal a road victory against the Packers, Beathard lost his mojo and collapsed under the pressure. As a result, the last three 49er drives ended in three-and-outs. Not surprisingly, the Packers were able to pull off a comeback with a Mason Crosby field goal that was set up thanks to some fantastic quarterbacking from Aaron Rodgers.</p>

<p>I guess the lesson here is to not trust Kyle Shanahan to keep a lead, at least not when his quarterback is CJ Beathard. Either Shanahan does not fully trust Beathard enough to sustain a lead or the man is simply still trying to hone his game management skills in his second year as a head coach.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Rams @ Broncos Halftime Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'><p>So I sided with the Broncos (+6.5) here in the SuperContest, expecting a bounce-back from Denver after suffering a humiliating defeat against the Jets. On top of that, I expected the cold weather and thin air to stunt the Rams attack somewhat.</p>

<p>So the Rams are making a living off the ground game here, but the Broncos defense has played <em>just</em> <em>well enough</em> to keep their team in the game. Really, it&rsquo;s the offense here that has completely soured.</p>

<p>Two things are really holding back the Broncos - the offensive line and Case Keenum. Let&rsquo;s start off discussing the former - the weak links on that offensive line are being exposed and the coaches are doing little to try and assist their beleaguered linemen with chips and additional blockers. On one of the few times a halfback actually stayed in the pocket to pass protect, a blitzer still managed to bowl him over for a drive-ending sack.</p>

<p>But really, Case Keenum is the one player holding the team back. His deep throws have been off-mark and ill-advised. I understand that you&rsquo;d want to throw deep against a secondary that has been carved up the past two weeks&hellip;but the Rams coaches have clearly worked on patching up some deficiencies on that side. And Keenum has been unable to alter his game in response. On the few times that a player is open in the defensive backfield, Keenum tends to throw some inaccurate passes.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Colts @ Jets - Halftime Quick Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'><p>So didn&rsquo;t do a Supercontest write-up here, but the Colts (+2.5) were one of my picks And it looked somepromising in the first quarter. Despite an unfortunate pick-six on the second play of the game, Andrew Luck and the Colts were producing yards and moving the ball fairly smoothly through the air.</p>

<p>But the Colts went out of their way to prove that the first turnover was no fluke. A fumble in the second quarter helped the Jets post seven more points on the board. Then an interception (induced by tight man coverage) led to three more points for the Jets prior to the second quarter ending. New York now sits as 10-point leaders going into halftime.</p>

<p>Long story short, the Colts receivers are a truly pathetic bunch. And I include the runningbacks in there as well. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe Indy&rsquo;s skill players decided to coat their gloves with butter for shits and giggles, but the team is having a damn hard time possessing the ball, let alone running free from a Jets secondary that are not world-beaters by any means.</p>

<p>I hope Frank Reich is verbally whupping some ass in the locker room as I type this.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 5 Supercontest Picks</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'><p>A 3-2 result last week&hellip;not too shabby. It could have been a 5-0 had a couple plays rolled out a bit better for me! But then again, the 3-2 record was justified to be frank. I try to avoid picking games where the outcome of the game (relative to the spread) is still uncertain in its final minutes.</p>

<p>The real sharps should be picking games where a resolution is comfortably reached well before the game ends. And I was able to do that on three different instances last week, thankfully. I feel as if I&rsquo;m getting my mojo back.</p>

<p>This week though&hellip;it&rsquo;s going to be a little difficult. I feel very confident <strong>only</strong> in two of my picks.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="denver-broncos-new-york-jets-1">Denver Broncos @ <em>New York Jets (-1)</em></h5>

<p>Quite a few people were shocked when this line was initially revealed. How could a fairly promising team like the Broncos be one-point underdog against a Jets team that&rsquo;s been humiliated three damn weeks in a row? Even my Elo model has the Jets pinned as slim underdogs.</p>

<p>Well, here&rsquo;s one of the reasons why - teams that have sustained consecutive losses are more likely to bounce back, provided the spot is right. And this spot should be right. Denver has to travel across two time zones on a short week for an early afternoon game. So I do not expect the Broncos to be playing at full potential, especially coming off a big primetime showing against a division rival.</p>

<p>On a bit of a different note, this Broncos team disappoints me for a couple different reasons. One, the team&rsquo;s head coach and its offensive coordinator have failed to field a serviceable offense for the past year and a half, which is unacceptable given that they have a proven commodity at quarterback. Second, Von Miller has had two consecutive games now where he&rsquo;s failed to do much. It&rsquo;s beginning to worry me, considering he&rsquo;s supposed to be a first-class edge rusher. Maybe those two games were just a blip&hellip;or maybe those two games were indicative that something is off with Von Miller this year. This game will determine which of those two statements is true.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="los-angeles-rams-7-seattle-seahawks"><em>Los Angeles Rams (-7)</em> @ Seattle Seahawks</h5>

<p>This may be my shakiest pick. Even my Elo model is screaming for me to side with the Seahawks here.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way that hot teams are hot for a reason. Every season, we have at least one team catch fire and burn through opposing teams on their schedule, covering spreads repeatedly in the process. The Panthers pulled this feat off three years ago. Then the Cowboys were the &ldquo;it&rdquo; team two years ago. And then the Eagles were the hot team last year. Now the Rams look to be that team spitting hot fire this year. And I hope this team steamrolls a Seahawks defense that&rsquo;s clearly in a rebuilding phase. Sure, Russell Wilson and his skill players can step up and start notching points on the scoreboard to keep up with the Rams, but that offense under Schotty looks&hellip;lost. It doesn&rsquo;t have that same scrappy attitude that I&rsquo;ve seen from the past couple years. And that bodes well for my Rams pick here!</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="minnesota-vikings-philadelphia-eagles-3">Minnesota Vikings @ <em>Philadelphia Eagles (-3)</em></h5>

<p>On the other hand, this is my <strong><em>best</em></strong> pick this week. I&rsquo;m so confident in this pick that I&rsquo;ll be betting more than five units on this.</p>

<p>Literally, little has changed between these two teams since their postseason meeting last year. The only real change is at quarterback. Whereas the Eagles are fielding a better passer this time around in Carson Wentz, the Vikings have slid backwards a bit with Kirk Cousins helming the offense. Think about that - despite starting a lesser quarterback, the Eagles managed to blow the Vikings out last season.</p>

<p>And now, the Eagles are only laying a field goal here, even though Philadelphia will now be the team fielding the better passer. On top of that, the Eagles are coming back home off an emotional loss, which makes this a great spot for them.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="dallas-cowboys-houston-texans-3">Dallas Cowboys @ <em>Houston Texans (-3)</em></h5>

<p>The Cowboys and Texans are meeting in an exciting match, at least to me.</p>

<p>To my surprise, people seem to be taking the Cowboys&rsquo; prospects seriously in this match-up. And I don&rsquo;t know why. Yes, the Cowboys have the better defense here, but the Texans feature the <em>better quarterback</em> here. And playing on home field in primetime should juice up that Texans pass rush, which should hopefully mask the deficiencies in their defensive backfield. Then again, even if Houston was fielding corpses to man the secondary, does it honestly even matter? Dak Prescott and his wide receivers have yet to discover a consistent passing game.</p>

<p>Ezekiel Elliott will find ways to eat up yards in this game. But it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine a runningback alone keeping his team in contention. Maybe the Cowboys defense steps up and keeps the Texans attack at bay. But at home in primetime, I&rsquo;m willing to put money on Houston.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="washington-redskins-6-5-new-orleans-saints"><em>Washington Redskins</em> <em>(+6.5)</em> @ New Orleans Saints</h5>

<p>Frankly, the Redskins may be too undervalued here. I understand the Saints are a highly proficient team on offense, but the team showed some limits on offense last week against the Giants. Don&rsquo;t let their score fool you - the Saints were largely bottled up for much of the game. It was only from Alvin Kamara&rsquo;s heroics that the Saints were able to drive the score upwards. Michael Thomas spent a good bit of the game bracketed in coverage, leaving Brees without much in terms of receivers. Drew Brees is relying on Michael Thomas as a crutch. So long as Washington can blanket Thomas, Brees will struggle at points.</p>

<p>More importantly, Washington (under Jay Gruden) has a bit of a tendency to respond well when they&rsquo;re big underdogs. Considering that this is a primetime match-up, I expect the Redskins to be more than ready for the Saints in this game. A win may be a stretch, but a cover here looks good to me.</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'><p>I do not like to waste time, so let&rsquo;s kick off this blog by keeping people current on my upcoming SuperContest weeks.</p>

<p>FYI, my Westgate SuperContest record is 6-9-0. It blows, I know&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="houston-texans-indianapolis-colts-1">Houston Texans @ <em>Indianapolis Colts (-1)</em></h5>

<p>The Texans were gobsmacked by the Giants last week. Despite New York fielding its worst pass rush over the last couple years, the Giants were able to rough Deshaun Watson up on several occasions. If that isn&rsquo;t enough to convince you this Houston offensive line is a damned mess, then consider that this offensive line is blamed for surrendering 50 quarterback pressures over the past 3 weeks, according to Pro Football Focus.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to fix a bad offensive line, particularly against good pass rushers. And the Colts feature a solid bunch of them in Jabaal Sheard, Darius Leonard, and Margus Hunt, the last of whom is well on his way to being considered elite.</p>

<p>On offense, the Colts suck. It&rsquo;s clear Andrew Luck is still held back by his shoulder, given his lousy yards-per-pass stat. But the team has demonstrated that they could still win, even with a noodle-armed Luck under center.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="san-francisco-49ers-10-san-diego-los-angeles-chargers"><em>San Francisco 49ers</em> <em>(+10)</em> @ <del>San Diego</del> Los Angeles Chargers</h5>

<p>Is Jimmy Garoppalo really worth 6 points against the spread? I don&rsquo;t think so&hellip;.but the next few weeks will truly reveal whether Jimmy G&rsquo;s absence truly impacts this team&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<p>My hunch tells me C.J. Beathard should be able to fill in serviceably. It&rsquo;s worth noting that his sorry numbers from last year can be somewhat excused as he was an unpolished third-round rookie. Spending a full year in Shanahan&rsquo;s system should help him better manage this offense.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it helps he&rsquo;ll be making his season debut against the Chargers, a team incapable of rushing the passer without its star edge rusher, Joey Bosa. And on top of that, the 49ers should be able to grind out quality yards against a team that has struggled to contain the run.</p>

<h5 id="new-york-jets-jacksonville-jaguars-7-5">New York Jets @ <em>Jacksonville Jaguars (-7.5)</em></h5>

<p>Ah&hellip;.the Jets. The team has lost its mojo after that phenomenal showing against the Lions to open the season. It took two consecutive poor performances to remind us that Sam Darnold is going to have to go through some growing pains as he adjusts to life in the NFL.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for him, this is not a good spot for the young man to righten himself. This Jaguars defense is particularly vicious when they play in Jacksonville. I don&rsquo;t expect Darnold to maintain his composure for long.</p>

<p>Now if Bortles actually bothered to study game tape this week, Jacksonville&rsquo;s offense may actually be productive this week. I would hope the man shows up to play after a horrendous outing last week against the Titans.</p>

<h5 id="kansas-city-chiefs-denver-broncos-5">Kansas City Chiefs @ <em>Denver Broncos (+5)</em></h5>

<p>This is an Elo pick. My Elo ratings seem to indicate that Vegas is overrating the Chiefs by <em>at least</em> 5 points in this game. Which make sense. The bookmakers know well enough that the betting public loves to hammer teams with sensational offenses. A Monday night game featuring an offensive juggernaut is going to attract quite a few bettors, no doubt.</p>

<p>With Denver coming off a terrible overall performance and playing at home in primetime, I am convinced the Broncos hold the emotional edge over the Chiefs here. I expect some good things from these Von Miller, Case Keenum, and the rest of their fellow Broncos on Monday.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="detroit-lions-dallas-cowboys-3">Detroit Lions @ <em>Dallas Cowboys (-3)</em></h5>

<p>A pick that I feel is correct subjectively and from an Elo standpoint. The current spread essentially declares both the Lions and the Cowboys as equal. And honestly&hellip;that&rsquo;s too much of an overreaction from last week, when the Cowboys floundered pathetically while the Lions won triumphantly in front of a national audience. The Cowboys are still pretty damn good at running the ball with Ezekiel Elliott, and the Lions are frankly awful at slowing down opposing rushers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Lions are coming off an emotional high whereas the Cowboys are coming off an emotional low. If there&rsquo;s any team that has reason to play harder this week, it would be the Cowboys.</p>

<hr />

<p>One thing worth noting&hellip;my first week of the Supercontest, I went 3-2. My second week, 2-3. And last week&hellip;1-4. If mathematical trends are truly a thing in gambling&hellip;.god help me.</p>
