	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>My favorite holiday of the year. Not because of the turkey or the food or anything, fuck that. It&rsquo;s all about having the day off to make bets on three consecutive primetime football games.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look through each game and find some bets to like. I feel good about these slate of games too.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="chicago-bears-detroit-lions-2-5-point-total-43-5">Chicago Bears @ Detroit Lions (+2.5) (Point Total: 43.5)</h4>

<p>The spread cleared below the key number of 3 earlier today as word finally got around that Mitch Trubisky was highly unlikely to play.</p>

<p>But would that really change much? Mitch Trubisky hasn&rsquo;t exactly been lighting the world on fire, despite what his raw numbers may initially indicate. His passing performance has been panned by analytical outlets and respectable commentators alike. What has been his saving grace has been his ability to run circles around defenders. And Chase Daniel doesn&rsquo;t have that talent, unfortunately. Nor is he much of a passer, obviously.</p>

<p>The Bears can still put up points courtesy of some fantastic scripted plays from Matt Nagy, but even he can only draw up so many plays before that well of creativity dries up.</p>

<p>Seems like a good time to bet on the Lions, no? Except the Lions will now be missing the services of <strong>both</strong> Marvin Jones and Kerryon Johnson. Kenny Galliday and Theo Riddick will now be the bellcows of Detroit&rsquo;s passing attack. And I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s enough to keep this game competitive against the NFL&rsquo;s best defense.</p>

<p>That under is looking sexy though&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Bet: Under 43.5</strong></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="washington-redskins-dallas-cowboys-7-point-total-40-5">Washington Redskins @ Dallas Cowboys (-7) (Point Total: 40.5)</h4>

<p>The books seem to think the Redskins will take a step back after Alex Smith&rsquo;s tragic season-ending injury last week. But Alex Smith was never a solid fit in the offensive system Jay Gruden was trying to institute. Colt McCoy, on the other hand, has demonstrated some comfort in Gruden&rsquo;s system. So it&rsquo;s very possible (even likely) that Washington will actually perform better with Colt McCoy at the helm of the offense. In fact, the offense actually came alive a bit when Colt stepped in - his first pass was a touchdown throw to Jordan Reed.</p>

<p>On top of that, these Cowboys are a little overrated. That win over the Falcons last week was driven mostly by Ezekiel Elliott. And unlike Atlanta&rsquo;s bottom-ranked defense, the Redskins defense have the chops to limit the havoc he wreaks. Not to mention the Redskins boast a bunch of quality pass rushers that can force the easily-flustered Dak Prescott into throwing some bad passes.</p>

<p><strong>Bets: Redskins +7, Redskins ML, &amp; Michael Gallup to Score a TD</strong></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="atlanta-falcons-new-orleans-saints-13-point-total-59-5">Atlanta Falcons @ New Orleans Saints (-13) (Point Total: 59.5)</h4>

<p>I went into some length in a <a href="https://www.owlpicks.com/posts/reviewing-atlanta-s-loss-against-the-cowboys/" title="post">post</a> yesterday about why the Falcons stand a good chance of covering against the Saints. Towards the end of that post, I also alluded to the fact that both teams should be able to feast against one another. Atlanta is struggling badly against the run, which bodes well for a Saints team that loves to pound the ball on the ground. But at the same time, the Saints defense isn&rsquo;t really anything special. While their run defense has been quite good so far, their secondary needs some work. Marcus Lattimore has lost some of his magic from last year. Eli Apple is shaping up into a decent cornerback, but he&rsquo;s only one man in a secondary ridden with holes everywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>Bets: Falcons +13 &amp; Over 59.5</strong></p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Reviewing Atlanta&#39;s Loss Against the Cowboys</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>To nudge myself out of the funk I was in Sunday night, when I barely missed hitting a lucrative five-team parlay (may the gods smite Kirk Cousins for the rest of his life), I decided to review game tape from the Falcons loss to the Cowboys earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Two major takeaways&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Matt Ryan found himself flustered by Dallas&rsquo; pass rush, especially when they blitzed. His worst throws of the day came against blitzes.</li>
<li>The Falcons have serious issues bottling up opposing rushers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those two reasons are why the Falcons fell to Dallas. While Atlanta stands little chance of making it to the postseason, it&rsquo;s still worth taking note of their advantages and shortcomings so that we can continue betting on their remaining games this season. Speaking of which&hellip;this Thanksgiving, the dirty birds will be traveling to New Orleans to face off against the Saints&hellip;<em>as 13-point underdogs</em>. Think of that - the Falcons as double-digit underdogs, despite Matt Ryan playing comparatively well.</p>

<p>So the question becomes whether the Saints are likely to cover. And honestly, I&rsquo;d say no.</p>

<p>First off, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Elo spread and the Vegas spread have <strong>finally</strong> drifted apart. It took quite a few blowouts, but the books have finally begun inflating the Saints&rsquo; handicap in anticipation of the public inevitably coming in heavy on them.  So we know the line for this game is a little skewed.</p>

<p>But really, where the Falcons gain an edge here is in pass protection. The absolute best way to stall Matt Ryan is to field a strong pass rush augmented with well-timed blitzes. The Cowboys have the horses to pull that off - New Orleans, not so much. Despite some positive numbers from Sheldon Rankins and their first-round rookie, Marcus Davenport, the reality is that the Saints should be producing much more pressure given that their opponents are playing from behind so much of the damn time. The Eagles from last year are a textbook example of ramping up the pressure when playing with a lead.</p>

<p>Now New Orleans boasts a powerful ground game that will expose the Falcons and their soft run defense. Still, Atlanta should be able to eat as well in this game, making this spread just a tad bit too ridiculous for my liking.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 11 - Risky Propositions</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>In this series, I&rsquo;ll details bets that are a little risky for my blood.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="panthers-lions">Panthers @ Lions</h5>

<p>Such a beautiful spot for the Lions here. Coming off three embarrassing losses, Detroit is primed to play better now that they&rsquo;ve returned back home and their season is on the line. And last week&rsquo;s game against Chicago shows me that the team can defend against the run when it&rsquo;s a central focus of their defensive game plan. Snacks Harrison manning the nose position has brought their rush defense up a notch.</p>

<p>If the Panthers cannot run the ball with reckless abandon here, Carolina may actually struggle to move the chains, let alone put up points. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a terrible bet to put some money on the Lions here, but <em>Marvin Jones</em> will be ruled out of the game on injury. The offense was gimpy without Golden Tate, but now you take their best receiver off the field as well? Too risky.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="cowboys-falcons">Cowboys @ Falcons</h5>

<p>The Falcons were depressing last week. Matt Ryan loses a step as a passer whenever he plays outside a dome. On top of that, that defense was carved up by Baker Mayfield and his skill players.</p>

<p>Now, the Falcons are currently fielding the league&rsquo;s worst run defense, on a yards-per-carry basis. But in fairness, that dishonor can be attributed to a 92-yard run Nick Chubb ripped off for a touchdown last week. Take away that play and the Falcons would instead be ranked as the tenth worst team against the run. Still, the point is that Atlanta is susceptible against the rush, which should be sweet music to a Cowboys team that rediscovered their ground game last week against the Eagles. If Ezekiel Elliott was able to chew off 150 yards on 20 carries at Philadelphia in primetime, the man should be ready to feast again on a Falcons defense that&rsquo;s equally inept at defending the run.</p>

<p>Then again, the Falcons do have one thing going for them - the fact that the team plays a few orders of magnitude better within the confines of their dome. In particular, take Matt Ryan - his passes see much more air in Atlanta than anywhere else. Likewise, I&rsquo;d think that defense plays with more energy in front of their home crowd. So it&rsquo;s a bit difficult to take a side here, especially when Dak Prescott insists on playing stupid from time to time.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 11 - Solid Bets</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>All right, so the Supercontest is a lost cause. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m treading water at exactly 50%. Statistically, I&rsquo;m no better than a coin. A fucking coin.</p>

<p>But at the very least, each season offers up lessons for me to internalize. I like to believe I improve as a bettor every year. To be honest though, my best year as a sports gambler has been the first year I&rsquo;ve actually started wagering serious money. Sooner or later, I will eventually match my sensational performance from that year.</p>

<p>Until then&hellip;week 11.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="vikings-2-5-bears"><em>Vikings (+2.5)</em> @ Bears</h5>

<p>The few outlets and NFL writers I respect have all sided with Minnesota here. And I will too.</p>

<p>Mitchell Trubisky is overrated. Analytical outfits continue to trash him week after week, despite his glowing passer rating. Careful observers have noted Trubisky&rsquo;s shortcomings, particularly against the blitz. And Mike Zimmer, as one of the best defensive minds in the game, has a history of exposing bad quarterbacks.</p>

<p>So at the very least, expect the Bears offense to finally stall this week, despite Matt Nagy&rsquo;s best attempts to scheme around a quarterback with limited ability.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="buccaneers-giants-2-5">Buccaneers @ <em>Giants (-2.5)</em></h5>

<p>The Buccaneers are losers. To rack up over 500-ish yards on offense only to post 3 measly points&hellip;it&rsquo;s pathetic. The Buccaneers are a damn mess on offense. Neither Jameis nor Fitzpatrick are serving the team well.</p>

<p>The Giants on the other hand have stepped up their game last week. Sure, Eli Manning was not as impressive as his statistics from last week may imply&hellip;but Eli still managed to finish drives, one of which won the game.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay should be able to score a few times in the game, but I expect the Giants to rack up even more points. Reviewing the game tape from last week, it seems Tampa Bay is happily content playing a soft zone defense. And these defenses tend to be exposed by offenses fielding a solid bunch of receivers. So the Giants have no excuse to lose this game in their quest to win out the rest of the season.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="eagles-saints-8-5">Eagles @ <em>Saints (-8.5)</em></h5>

<p>Seems odd to see the reigning Super Bowl champions be such heavy underdogs. But the Elo model thinks it&rsquo;s well-deserved.</p>

<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m shocked that the sportsbooks haven&rsquo;t set the line even higher, considering the Saints are coming off three consecutive covers against solid competition. I&rsquo;d honestly expect the books to set the line a little higher than usual in order to pull underdog money against such an elite team. Either the books are fine pricing the Saints appropriately or the spread is kept lower than usual to entice bets on a public darling in the Saints. If the latter is the case, that means the books are taking a chance on the Eagles here in this match. And that&rsquo;s a risky proposition in my book.</p>

<p>The Eagles are far from being that team that took the league by storm last year. Michael Lombardi gave me some phenomenal insights in his observations about the team. Last season, the team was converting third downs at an unbelievable clip.  This season, statistical regression finally reared its ugly head - Philadelphia is struggling to overcome third-down from six yards and out. Worse yet, the Eagles cannot run the ball, leading to their offense being one-dimensional. A pass-only offense is not necessarily a terrible thing so long as the quarterback has several weapons reliably catching his passes, but Philly&rsquo;s even lacking horses there. Nelson Agholor has regressed to mediocre form while Alshon Jeffery has been hampered by injury for much of the season.</p>

<p>To be fair, their acquisition of Golden Tate should even things out a bit, but I honestly wonder whether that would be enough to keep pace with the league&rsquo;s hottest team on their home soil.</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Good week last week from a betting perspective, even if two of my Supercontest picks were losers. A superteaser hit landed me a pretty penny. Anyway&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="saints-6-bengals"><em>Saints (-6)</em> @ Bengals</h5>

<p>Give me the Saints all day long.</p>

<p>The Bengals biggest problem on offense has always been that they lack reliable weapons that have won over the trust of their quarterback, Andy Dalton. And now you tell me his <em>most trusted receiver in AJ Green</em> is out? I couldn&rsquo;t care less about Joe Mixon - AJ Green is fundamentally integral to this offense. Without him, Cincinnatti&rsquo;s passing game loses much more than just a step.</p>

<p>The only thing that worries me is this potentially being a let-down spot for the Saints after two momentous wins against NFC heavyweights. But I&rsquo;ll chance it here with one of the NFL&rsquo;s more prolific offenses.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="falcons-5-browns"><em>Falcons (-5)</em> @ Browns</h5>

<p>I respect the Falcons and I respect their potent offense. But I disrespect the Browns so much more. The Browns had all the emotional fuel last week to cover against as 8-point underdogs against the Chiefs&hellip;and they still blow it.</p>

<p>The Browns will lose, with or without Hue Jackson. Losing is in their DNA this season. And even better, Gregg Williams seems intent on making sure the team stays true to their destiny this year.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="patriots-titans-6-5">Patriots @ <em>Titans (+6.5)</em></h5>

<p>Sure, the Titans come into this contest a little banged up off a short week, but I&rsquo;ll take my chances with Marcus Mariota and Mike Vrabel in Tennessee. This year&rsquo;s Patriots are not as intimidating as the Patriots of last year. More importantly, the team has played decisively worse on the road than at home.</p>

<p>The game will be decided on whether the Titans offensive line can hold Trey Flowers, Adrian Clayborn, and Deatrich Wise long enough for Marcus Mariota to throw some dimes.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="jaguars-colts-3">Jaguars @ <em>Colts (-3)</em></h5>

<p>Interesting line. I used to be a big fan of the Jaguars earlier in the season, especially after they stomped the Patriots and Jets early in the season. But after that Chiefs game, the team has turned into an unmitigated disaster. Blake Bortles has regressed to joke form, the defense is tussling with one another in the locker room, defensive backs are doing some incredibly stupid things off the field, the coaches are not even fully aware of the injury situations of their starters&hellip;</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Colts are on the up-and-up, having lit up the scoreboards the last two weeks (albeit against incredibly poor competition). Two positive games hint at a trend, but a third solid game tells me that the team is for real. Given that Indy has Andrew Luck at quarterback and Frank Reich as head coach, I do believe this Colts team is for real.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="cowboys-eagles-6-5">Cowboys @ <em>Eagles (-6.5)</em></h5>

<p>Not the biggest fan of this pick, but the Supercontest mandates I pick five games a week, and I like to pick teams led by a good head coach and a good quarterback. It also helps that the Eagles boast one of the best set of pass rushers in the league. And I&rsquo;d much rather side with Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham matching up against a beleaguered Cowboys offensive front and a struggling quarterback.</p>

<p>Then again, I&rsquo;m not liking these Eagles players constantly chirping about their distaste for the Cowboys. You&rsquo;re only giving Dallas more emotional fodder by being so public with your trash talk of the Ladyboys here.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Bucs @ Panthers - Some Quick Game Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Just some real quick analysis&hellip;.</p>

<p>The Panthers played phenomenal here, much to my surprise. And yet, a part of me still has questions of whether the Panthers are actually a legitimate playoff threat.</p>

<p>Their success in the last game was predicated on two things - devilishly creative play-calling and an eagerness to blitz against an offense that has <em>absolutely</em> no ability to read an incoming blitz.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me? Well, let me show you a few plays that stood out to me.</p>

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:55.05%'>
    <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/PastViciousKoi' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' 
            height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Look at that double-reverse. You don&rsquo;t see many teams running that type of play, but the Panthers have the exact right personnel to run that type of play - a threatening rusher in Christian McCaffrey and two swiss-knife playmakers in DJ Moore and Damiere Byrd. The Bucs defense was completely out of sorts by the time  DJ Moore began motioning uphill.</p>

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:55.05%'>
    <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WeeklyDearestAntipodesgreenparakeet' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' 
            height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Look at that blitz being telegraphed prior to the ball being snapped. And yet the Panthers pass rushers on that play still manage to throw Fitzpatrick into a tizzy.</p>

<p>The Buccaneers began coming back in the second half, in part because Tampa Bay managed to neutralize the blitz every now and then (maybe by luck?). Still, the team let their quarterback be abused far too many times in the second half - Fitzpatrick deserves a purple heart for trying to mount a comeback in those circumstances.</p>

	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<h5 id="packers-5-patriots"><em>Packers (+5)</em> @ Patriots</h5>

<p>Listen, it&rsquo;s always risky betting against the Patriots, but their defense is a little too tepid for my liking. The Packers will cover so long as Bill Belichick&rsquo;s defense fail to keep Aaron Rodger&rsquo;s receivers bottled up under man coverage. As I keep saying, the Packers can be routed so long as you have a defensive secondary that can hold up well in man-to-man defense. If you don&rsquo;t have such a secondary, expect Rodgers to run up some scores on you.</p>

<p>That being said, the only truly solid corner the Patriots bring to field is Stephon Gilmore, which would normally be a cause for concern if New England was coached by anybody but Bill Belichick. But the Darth has a way of bringing out better performances from his defensive personnel on certain weeks. Now would be the week for his defensive backs to step up and make Aaron Rodgers hold the ball long enough so that Trey Flowers to hit home.</p>

<p>Now even if the Packers see some of their drives stall through the game, Green Bay can still cover the spread. The Packers boast a quality pass rush that can throw Brady off on some of his drives. So I like Green Bay quite a bit here.</p>

<p>Of course, whenever I end up liking a side a <em>little too much,</em> the betting gods find a way to fuck me. So beware here&hellip;</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 9 - Best Bets</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>My best bets of the week. Last week, I went 2-3. Two of those three losses came courtesy of the Chiefs and Rams failing to cover their spreads. BAH! I would not consider either of those picks to be terrible&hellip;but it is pretty clear neither team deserved to cover their respective spreads last week. And this week, I will be rooting against one of them to flat out lose.</p>

<p>Here are five of my six picks.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="lions-vikings-4-5">Lions @ <em>Vikings (-4.5)</em></h5>

<p>Rivers McCown of Football Outsiders did an <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/any-given-sunday/2018/any-given-sunday-seahawks-over-lions">excellent piece</a> on the Seahawks-Lions game last week. As part of his research, he looked into the Lions rushing attack this season and drew up a chart showing a peculiarity about the consequences of their run game.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Screen Shot 2018-11-02 at 11.58.08 PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>DVOA ratings are the proprietary metrics that Football Outsiders developed to grade teams on any facet of their game. Basically, if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with DVOA, just know that in the particular case of this chart, a higher DVOA means a better performance from the offense.</p>

<p>The Lions rushing attack only graded out positively two weeks this season. And those two weeks brought out the absolute best in their offense as well. And when their rush game isn&rsquo;t quite on point? Their offense suffers dearly.</p>

<p>I expect their offense to stall against a Vikings defense that&rsquo;s one of the best at limiting yards per carry. Sure, Minnesota may end up missing the services of Stefon Diggs in this game, but I trust Mike Zimmer will have other people step up in his stead and contribute effectively enough. And on top of that, I do expect the Lions offense to regress a little now that Stafford will have to live life without Golden Taint.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="chiefs-browns-under-52">Chiefs @ Browns <em>(Under 52)</em></h5>

<p>Holy hell. I love this pick. I absolutely do.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes when I saw such a high total. Although I suppose I understand why the sportsbook set the total past 50&hellip;we have a Chiefs team that can seemingly score at will.</p>

<p>But the Browns just promoted their defensive coordinator to interim head coach earlier in the week, right as the AFC&rsquo;s top team comes to town. The situational context may be enough for the Browns defense to keep the Chiefs at bay for much of this game.</p>

<p>Likewise, I expect the Browns offense to stall as well, as Baker Mayfield will likely be harangued by the Chiefs potent pass rush. And even if the Browns offensive line manage to win in pass protection for much of the game&hellip;will the offense even be serviceable under the stifling thumb of Gregg Williams?</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="steelers-3-ravens"><em>Steelers (+3)</em> @ Ravens</h5>

<p>Bah. Going with the Steelers here, as two major analytics outfits (Pro Football Focus and Football Outsiders) have both flagged the Steelers as a hot pick this week.</p>

<p>It does make sense though. A divisional rematch against a hated rival tends to favor the loser of the first match, especially if that loser is taking points in the second match. On top of that, the Steelers have shown some promise over their last couple games, particularly in their ground game. The Ravens, on the other hand, have shown us reason to doubt them in their game last week against the Panthers.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="buccaneers-6-panthers"><em>Buccaneers (+6)</em> @ Panthers</h5>

<p>Give me the Bucs all day here. Yes, the Panthers proved that they were a damn good team in their win last week against the Ravens, but it seems to me that win was buoyed in part by a flaccid performance from Flacco and an emotionally-fueled performance from their offensive and defensive lines. If you believe in let-down spots, this is a solid let-down spot, what with the Panthers playing at home against a bottom-feeder going through some turmoil at the quarterback position.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Screen Shot 2018-11-04 at 12.07.51 PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To be fair, my ELO model above has actually booked this game in favor of the Panthers by 8 points. And I understand why - the Panthers have been consistently winning against solid competition whereas the Buccaneers have been flailing for the past several weeks. But the Buccaneers offense have proven they can scrounge up points, regardless of whether Jameis Winston or Ryan Fitzpatrick sits at its helm. And I do expect them to round up scores against a Panthers defensive secondary that can be picked upon.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="rams-saints-1-5">Rams @ <em>Saints (-1.5)</em></h5>

<p>The Rams frustrated me last week, mostly because I had quite a bit of money on them. They were lucky to escape their own coliseum with a win after Ty Montgomery decided to go rogue and run the ball out of the end-zone on a kickoff.</p>

<p>What last week showed me is that the Rams lack quality defensive personnel, particularly in the backfield. Wade Phillips knows damn well how to stop Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay offense - blanket their receivers in man coverage and count on Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh to wreak havoc on the frontlines. He successfully implemented a similar game plan against Green Bay as defensive coordinator of the Broncos during their Super Bowl year.</p>

<p>But the Packers receivers were running buck wild around the field because the defensive backs were simply unable to compete. And if those defensive backs are unable to hang with an average set of receivers, Drew Brees and Michael Thomas should have their way against the secondary, especially if those linebackers focus wholly on Alvin Kamara.</p>

<hr />

<p>The sixth pick will be revealed later tonight&hellip;.</p>
