			<p>Some quick points&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Incredibly hard-fought match. I would say Matt Nagy out-coached Doug Pederson here. Lining Allen Robinson up over cornerback Avonte Maddox and having him run double moves on the young defensive back yielded big gains in the pass game. The Eagles took a little too long to fix that issue.</p></li>

<li><p>Mitch Trubisky handled his nerves well. He threw two bad throws early on that should have been picked if the Eagles&rsquo; cornerbacks were just a bit more sure-handed. One of those passes could have actually been returned by the Eagles for a defensive touchdown. Still, it&rsquo;s clear to me that whatever jitters he may have had were shaken off by the end of the second quarter.</p></li>

<li><p>The Eagles&rsquo; pass rush was limp on most plays. I understand the Eagles were deathly concerned about Trubisky&rsquo;s tendency to scramble wildly, but not much emphasis was placed on even pressuring the young quarterback. From what I noticed, the Eagles were too content just bull rushing the pocket and sending only four men to rush the passer. Trubisky was way too comfortable in the pocket at times. Bull rushes only work on offensive lines that flat out suck. The Bears have one of the best offensive lines in the league and it seems as if Philadelphia&rsquo;s brain trust wasn&rsquo;t aware of that.</p></li>
</ul>

	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Some quick points&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For once, I was right on the money with my quick little analysis. Lamar Jackson&rsquo;s inexperience held him back for most of the game.</p></li>

<li><p>More importantly, the Chargers drafted a much better game plan in this rematch. Los Angeles dedicated so many more defensive resources to the run this time around. The SuperChargers were daring the Ravens to throw the ball and Lamar Jackson simply shriveled up under the postseason spotlight.</p></li>

<li><p>Melvin Ingram had his way with the offensive line here. Joey Bosa had his moments as well, particular when lining up against the guards/center. But Ingram was fantastic. The Ravens seemed almost powerless against him.</p></li>

<li><p>The Ravens&rsquo; best moments on offense came towards the end, where Lamar was forced into constant passing situations. Not only did Lamar have an easier time throwing the ball against prevent defense schemes, but the uptempo pace also helped to slow down that Chargers pass rush.</p></li>
</ul>

			<p>So the first two games are done and I&rsquo;m technically 1-1. While I was <strong>horrifically</strong> off in my assessment of the Colts-Texans game, the Seahawks managed to cover the spread in the last minutes of the game. But in all honesty, I deserve to be 0-2. Had the Seahawks not lost their kicker to injury at the end of the first half, Seattle would likely have lost by 3 points instead of 2 points. Instead, they opted to go a two-point conversion after their last touchdown, as Pete Carroll had no confidence in the backup kicker.</p>

<p>I was initially using a points system to compare teams that were going against one another. That points system hasn&rsquo;t been documented here, but honestly, it was a bit too complicated for its own good. Clearly, it&rsquo;s no good&hellip;the system actually anticipated the Texans to win big today. But come game time, it was the Colts taking the wood to Houston instead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use another system that compares teams to one another among different categories. Each category is equally weighted to one another - no one category takes precedence when determining which team is more likely to win.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to revise my picks for tomorrow using this new system.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="chargers-ravens-3">Chargers @ Ravens (-3)</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/Wild Card Analysis - Chargers @ Ravens.jpg" alt="" />The Chargers and Ravens are fairly even here. Whereas the Chargers claim an advantage here in terms of quarterbacking experience/performance, the Ravens have the better set of offensive weapons as well as home field advantage. The game plans each team draws up will be critical in determining the win. Given that the Chargers are being given 3 points&hellip;I&rsquo;ll go with the Chargers here.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Chargers (+3)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="eagles-bears-6-5">Eagles @ Bears (-6.5)</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/Wild Card Analysis - Eagles @ Bears.jpg" alt="" />By my estimation, the Bears have nothing over the Eagles outside of home field advantage. The Eagles carry two categories here though - quarterback performance and playoff experience. Given that the two teams draw even in every other category, the Eagles should not only cover the spread, but also win the game.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Eagles (+6.5) &amp; Eagles (ML)</strong></p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Cowboys over Seahawks - Quick Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Just a few points to make about the Cowboys win over the Seahawks&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>If the definition of insanity is doing something over and over again expecting different results&hellip;then the Seahawks offensive game plan is the quintessential example of insanity. Constantly running the ball up the middle of this Seahawks defense did not work was nothing but  exercises in futility.</li>
</ul>

<p>-
* Dallas had the more dynamic offense here. The Cowboys involved were able to incorporate receivers other than Amari Cooper into the offensive game plan. Michael Gallup caught a tough fade for a touchdown and Cole Beasley converted a few key 3rd downs. Honestly, the Cowboys offense was better coached compared to the Seahawks offense. This loss is largely on Pete Carroll and his stubborn insistence on running the ball.</p>

<p>-
* But Dallas deserves credit too. Dak Prescott avoided making mistakes. Despite Seattle&rsquo;s best attempts, Dak avoided fumbling the ball or throwing a silly interception. His only interception came on a defensive pass interference that the referees did not call.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Colts over Texans - Quick Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Several quick points to make here&hellip;.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bill O&rsquo;Brien is a terrible coach. Too many times, I saw Indianapolis had a beat on the Texans&rsquo; offensive schemes before the snap. Honestly, the Colts knew Houston&rsquo;s playbook better than some of Houston&rsquo;s own skill players.</p></li>

<li><p>Penalties. The Texans committed too many sloppy pre-snap penalties, two of which sustained drives that led to Colt touchdowns. Not only are these players stupid for drawing these penalties, but Houston&rsquo;s coaching bears some blame here for letting these guys play so undisciplined.</p></li>

<li><p>Deshaun Watson was shook for much of the game. I thought his recent experience playing in the college championship would help him adjust quickly to the playoff atmosphere&hellip;but I was wrong. Watson constantly threw passes short or wide of the mark. Furthermore, any chemistry Deshaun developed with his skill players over the season was completely absent this game. Watson threw several passes that should have been picked off had the Colts&rsquo; defenders been a touch quicker.</p></li>

<li><p>The Colts burst out of the gate with three straight scoring drives. I was an idiot for thinking Indianapolis would play sloppy early on given their relative inexperience. The reality is that Indianapolis&rsquo; playoffs began last week against the Titans. That was the game for Indy to untangle itself of any postseason jitters. Truth be told, Indy played almost mistake-free in this game. The Colts only turned the ball over once, and that was on a batted pass.</p></li>

<li><p>Clowney was disappointing. The man was blanked when it came to rushing the quarterback. No sacks, hits, or batted passes.</p></li>
</ul>

			<h3 id="colts-texans-1">Colts @ Texans (-1)</h3>

<p>Loving the Texans here. The Texans are the team with more talent, more playoff experience, and home field advantage. Houston <em>should</em> win rather commandingly here.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Texans (ML)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="seahawks-cowboys-2-5">Seahawks @ Cowboys (-2.5)</h3>

<p>Both teams are roughly even on defense. However, the Cowboys are playing with home field advantage, whereas the Seahawks come into this contest with an elite quarterback and a more dynamic offense. Not quite certain what will play a bigger role in this game, but the Seahawks carry another advantage over the Cowboys here - coaching. Pete Carroll is the craftier coach in this match-up.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Seahawks (+2.5)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="chargers-ravens-3">Chargers @ Ravens (-3)</h3>

<p>The hardest game for me to predict this week. Both defenses are stocked with talent. Yes, the Chargers bring a far better quarterback to the table, but the Ravens offense have more weapons with which to attack <del>Los Angeles</del> San Diego&rsquo;s defense. But in the end, what should make all the difference in the world here is that this game is taking place in Maryland instead of Los Angeles.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Ravens (ML)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="eagles-bears-6-5">Eagles @ Bears (-6.5)</h3>

<p>My other favorite pick this week will be the Eagles. Yes, the Bears have had an outstanding season. But the lack of playoff experience and the liability playing at quarterback will drag them back, especially against a team as stacked as the Eagles.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Eagles (+6.5)</strong></p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The dynasty team finds its way into the playoffs yet again, this time as the second seed in the American Football Conference.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-tom-brady">Quarterback: <em>Tom Brady</em></h4>

<p>One year removed from being crowned the league MVP, Tom Brady is still very much an elite player. That being said, his play has regressed a bit. His deep ball accuracy percentage sunk downward from 46.5% to 43%. His passing yards per attempt has dropped by about three-tenths of a yard. He&rsquo;s also scored fewer touchdowns this year, opting to throw slightly more interceptions instead.</p>

<p>But the question that needs to be asked here is whether this regression can be attributed to Brady aging or his fellow teammates failing him. And honestly, it&rsquo;s a difficult question to answer. Tom Brady is past retirement age, so he&rsquo;s long overdue for a downfall, but the Patriots skill players are no longer these weapons that can reliably produce. Chris Hogan is no longer the slasher he was the last couple of years. Nor is Rob Gronkowski anywhere close to being a dominant tight end anymore. Brandin Cooks being shipped off to Los Angeles didn&rsquo;t help things either, as the offense lacked a deep receiving threat to start the season. Midway through the year, it seems the Patriots finally found that trusted deep threat in Josh Gordon, but the man&rsquo;s personal demons were too much for the team to handle. So without Gordon, the Patriots are back in the same situation they were in at the beginning of the season.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-james-white-julian-edelman">Offensive Weapons: <em>James White, Julian Edelman</em></h4>

<p>As the only player to have garnered over 1000 yards from scrimmage this season, James White deserves top billing on this list. The Patriots love their wheel routes and no other halfback on this team runs those routes as smoothly as James White.</p>

<p>Likewise, Julian Edelman deserves to be on this list as well, simply for being Brady&rsquo;s favorite receiver. Brady truly thrives when he has a receiver that can run all sorts of directions from the slot position. Over the years, Edelman and Brady have developed a rapport that no other current receiver on the team can match. That relationship will be critical if the Patriots are to reach the conference championships.</p>

<p>Now&hellip;notice Gronk is not on this list?  Well, this year may have been Rob Gronkowski&rsquo;s worst year in football, statistically speaking. For a guy that was averaging over 76 yards a game for the past five years, his 52.5 yards per game this year is shockingly low. Furthermore, scoring only 3 touchdowns over 13 games is not a good stat for a man that was heralded as one of the league&rsquo;s best red zone weapons. It&rsquo;s become clear to many people that Gronkowski is no longer the beast he was in years past, running amok along the middle of the field while undersized defensive backs tried hopelessly to keep him contained. And as a result, he can no longer be counted on as a dependable offensive weapon.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-trey-flowers">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Trey Flowers</em></h4>

<p>For the second year in a row, Trey Flowers has been the team&rsquo;s star at rushing the quarterback. With 20 quarterback hits and 32 solo tackles, Flowers has made his presence known in quite a few games this season.</p>

<p>The only other edge rusher worth consideration here is Deatrich Wise Jr. But numbers alone are sufficient to come to a conclusion here. Last year, the man posted 19 quarterback hits, 5 sacks, and 16 solo tackles. This year, he only notched 16 quarterback hits, 4.5 sacks, and 15 solo tackles. If I did not consider him to be an elite pass rusher last year, why the hell would I consider him one this year when the numbers paint a weaker picture?</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>The Patriots roll into the postseason with several new faces, but the major players on the team are all well-versed in playoff football. The only major starters lacking playoff experience are running backs Sony Michel and Cordarrelle Patterson, corner Jason McCourty, and left tackle Trent Brown.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-bill-belichick-hc-josh-mcdaniels-oc">Coach: <em>Bill Belichick (HC), Josh McDaniels (OC)</em></h4>

<p>The wunderkind Sean McVay is definitely a great coach, if simply for making Jared Goff look like an MVP candidate for a couple weeks. With the right personnel, his offensive schemes produces excellent results. Likewise, Wade Phillips is a fantastic defensive coordinator in his own right. Even if his unit has not been anything worth raving about this year, the man holds distinction as a defensive mastermind. So I trust the Rams are in good hands with these two leading the team.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>In years past, the Patriots were almost always Super Bowl contenders. This year is a different story. With a pedestrian defense and a reduced offense, the Patriots may not even win one playoff game this year.</p>
