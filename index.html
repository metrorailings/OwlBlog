	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Kansas City Chiefs</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Chiefs entered the postseason unexpectedly with a bye. Let&rsquo;s analyze them down using the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>, shall we?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Maybe? After Mahomes went down with a dislocated knee, the team did pretty well without their star player, taking out the Vikings and putting up one hell of a fight against the Packers.</p>

<p>Then again, it&rsquo;s tough to say. The odd thing about Reid is despite his offensive brilliance, his teams tend to lack that inherent fortitude that&rsquo;s really necessary to survive against tough competition in the playoffs. Too many times has his team been routed unceremoniously or earlier than expected in the postseason. Just from his tenure with the Chiefs alone, he&rsquo;s only won twice in the postseason while losing four times. Three of those losses in particular were pretty embarrassing - one to a Colts team they were leading by 28 points at one point, another to an undermanned Titans team led by Marcus Mariota, and yet another to a Steelers team that scored nothing but field goals. Two of those three losses were at home!</p>

<p>Honestly, if I had to lean one way here, it would be no. Reid doesn&rsquo;t quite have what it takes to build a team that can grit their way through a row of difficult matches.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Spagnuolo has actually done pretty well here. After Bob Sutton was fired, the Chiefs hired Steve Spagnuolo as defensive coordinator to repair what was effectively a broken unit. With a little help, Spagnuolo was able to turn this unit into one of the best defenses in the league in terms of pass coverage. Nothing sums this up better than the fact that blitzing went up by nearly 50% compared to last year, all while keeping the yardage given up per passing attempt pretty low.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes, every single starter has significant playoff experience.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes. Mahomes hasn&rsquo;t been the same MVP-caliber quarterback compared to last year, but he&rsquo;s still elite. His deep ball is still arguably the best in the league.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>No doubt here. Andy Reid is a goddamn offensive mastermind, especially with the right talent at offense. The Chiefs certainly have the talent to fully realize Andy&rsquo;s vision of a dynamic offense predicated on pre-snap movement and unusual formations.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>Only one player I can definitively assert as an elite pass rusher - <strong><em>Chris Jones</em></strong>. His numbers are all the more impressive considering he&rsquo;s an interior defensive lineman.</p>

<p><strong><em>Frank Clark</em></strong> could prove himself elite during the postseason, but he hasn&rsquo;t done enough during the regular season to fill me with confidence. His numbers are decent, but roughly half of his quarterback hits came against two teams. His numbers turn pedestrian when you take away his games against the Chargers and Broncos. You can&rsquo;t say the same about Chris Jones, on the other hand.</p>

<p>Maybe if the Chiefs are lucky, <strong><em>Terrell Suggs</em></strong> experiences a rebirth in Kansas City and steps up as the team&rsquo;s second complimentary pass rusher.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Tyreek Hill</em></strong> is just dangerous as an all-around receiver.</p>

<p><strong><em>Travis Kelce</em></strong> would likely be considered the best tight-end in the league if George Kittle didn&rsquo;t have such a monster year with the 49ers.</p>

<p>Besides those two, things get a little bit more murky here. <strong><em>Mecole Hardman</em></strong> is another player worth considering here, though his role in the offenses seems more limited to being Tyreek Hill&rsquo;s understudy. <strong><em>Sammy Watkins</em></strong> started the season strong, but his production has tapered off since, save for some decent games against the Patriots and Titans. <strong><em>Damien Williams</em></strong> may be the only other player worthy of vector status here, given his penchant for breaking tackles. Injury seems to have slowed him during the regular season though, so let&rsquo;s see if his health concerns persist into the postseason.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but (likely) only during the divisional round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Not too sure. Butker missed three field goals, all in games that can be considered close. To his credit, he&rsquo;s been perfect the second half of the season out.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Yes, Tyrann Matthieu has been damn good following in Eric Berry&rsquo;s footsteps and then blazing his own path.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Chiefs have quite a bit of talent and solid coaching. But three critical deficiencies present themselves here - their seeding, the lack of a second outstanding defensive pass rusher, and the lack of resolve. The last drawback is especially concerning, as Andy Reid&rsquo;s teams have been doomed too many times in these playoffs precisely for that reason. Without that mental strength, a team must have complete home field advantage and be stacked in every other major aspect covered here to have a good shot at the Super Bowl.I</p>

<p>In this case though, Kansas is missing a second pass rusher worth his salt as well as total home field advantage. The Chiefs only have slim hopes of winning the AFC title, let alone the championship.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - San Francisco 49ers</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The 49ers enter the postseason as the top seed. So let&rsquo;s examine their prospects using my trusty old rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Unsure. The last three weeks of the season were bizarre. One game was lost to an underwhelming Atlanta team riding the coattails of Julio Jones. The other two games were unnecessarily close. Yes, I acknowledge that key pieces of their defense were sidelined due to injury but it still doesn&rsquo;t sit well with me.</p>

<p>Then again, San Francisco did go on a rough five-week stretch in which they faced off against four playoff teams. While their record for those weeks includes two losses, those losses were hard-fought.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>No. I still contend that Robert Saleh cannot be considered an elite coach. The team&rsquo;s success on defense comes so much more from talent rather than scheme. In fact, Saleh&rsquo;s approach to defense has been notoriously failing for other teams around the league, whether in Jacksonville or Atlanta or Los Angeles or even Seattle.</p>

<p>On top of that, the Arizona Cardinals managed to ring up points against this defense in two (almost) back-to-back meetings, even though their scheme on offense is pretty obviously configured to favor short passes.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>No. Jimmy Garoppalo lacks meaningful playoff experience. Likewise, Deebo Samuel and George Kittle, two of the most valuable skill players, lack postseason experience.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>No. The passing offense on this team has seen some great success courtesy of scheme and raw talent instead of quarterback competence. Credit due to Garoppolo though - he&rsquo;s been excellent in his direction of Kyle Shanahan&rsquo;s system. So was Matt Ryan the year the Falcons went to the Super Bowl with Shanahan at offensive coordinator - Ryan&rsquo;s play was taken to whole another level. I feel the same applies here as well, in that Garoppalo&rsquo;s numbers have been inflated thanks to a system that prides itself on misdirection and unpredictability. While Jimmy has shined in his execution of this system, he hasn&rsquo;t even come close to matching the same success Ryan had running these same concepts.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Without a doubt. Kyle Shanahan has whipped this offense into something magical. Only Baltimore has a scarier offense, to be honest.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h2>

<p><strong><em>Nick Bosa</em></strong> is this team&rsquo;s premiere pass-rusher.</p>

<p>After him, <strong><em>Arik Armstead</em></strong> presents a strong case here, given his numbers alone. Past the numbers, I&rsquo;ve observed Armstead constantly making plays throughout the season, justifying his designation here as an elite pass rusher.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dee Ford</em></strong> is potentially another name worth adding to this list, though things remain uncertain given his complicated injury history this season.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The team&rsquo;s single best weapon on offense is its tight end, <strong><em>George Kittle.</em></strong> George Kittle&rsquo;s numbers alone sell his case as the team&rsquo;s biggest offensive threat. <strong><em>Deebo Samuel</em></strong> and <strong><em>Emmanual Sanders</em></strong> are other receivers that can be noted as vectors here, especially the former given his ability to run like Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>

<p>When it comes to their offensive backfield, the 49ers have two additional vectors - the fullback <strong><em>Kyle Juszczyk</em></strong> and their committee of tailbacks (<strong><em>Raheem Mostert / Tevin Coleman / Matt Breida</em></strong>). Juszczyk&rsquo;s numbers don&rsquo;t necessarily justify his designation as a vector, but the man&rsquo;s ability to catch the ball out of the backfield is especially valuable for an offense looking to exhaust defenses and their limited coverage resources.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, all through the NFC playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p><em>Arguably</em> yes. Aside from a bad game in which Gould shanked two kicks and had one blocked and another game that was played in some horrific weather, Gould has been pretty good. Maybe I&rsquo;m making too many excuses for him here, but I&rsquo;ll give him the benefit of the doubt given his history.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Richard Sherman has been one of the best cornerbacks in the league this year, so yes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The 49ers are missing the services of a brilliant defensive mind and a quarterback that can play his way out of negative game script. Not to mention their lack of experience will hurt them as well against the Vikings. Even though I&rsquo;ve been pretty damn awful at predicting postseason outcomes so far in these write-ups, I&rsquo;ll continue doing so because I&rsquo;m a dumb fuck - I do think the Vikings will upset the 49ers here.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Baltimore Ravens</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Ravens enter the postseason as the top seed of the American Football Conference. Let&rsquo;s break them down using my good old rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Without a doubt. John Harbaugh has a history of fostering mental fortitude in his teams. That and the way this team dominated their competition after their bye week is enough to show me that this team is not shy on resolve.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Wink Martindale has been a genius in constructing this defense. Having a backfield full of stud defensive backs that can cover has allowed him to blitz the passer with reckless abandon. Despite their lack of dominant trench players, Baltimore can still pressure opposing quarterbacks thanks to the complexity of their blitz packages.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes. Lamar Jackson and most of the offense has postseason experience dating back to last year. Only the receiver corps are a little green in this area.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes. Lamar Jackson isn&rsquo;t necessarily the best passer of the football in the league, but he&rsquo;s been phenomenal running the ball and captaining an offense that&rsquo;s been built to suit his needs. His league MVP title this year is more than enough to justify his designation as an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Greg Roman has done yeoman&rsquo;s work in crafting the perfect offense around Lamar&rsquo;s skillset. Lamar Jackson is as much a product of Roman&rsquo;s system as he is a product of his own talent. The emphasis on rushing the ball a multitude of different ways as well as all the different ways tight ends are utilized has lent this offense a peculiarly rich quality not matched by any other team in the league this year.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h2>

<p>Only one - <strong><em>Matthew Judon</em></strong>. Judon has been dominant manhandling the offensive line and negotiating through the backfield this year, racking up at least 33 hits on the quarterback. If the Ravens would have opted to keep Za&rsquo;Darius Smith, this defensive unit would easily have the best pass rush in the league. Instead, Smith left for greener pastures and the Ravens don&rsquo;t have any other pass rushers worth bragging about.</p>

<p>The Ravens success in pressuring opposing quarterbacks in this team has come mostly from scheme and Judon&rsquo;s talent.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The biggest and most obvious vector is <strong><em>Lamar Jackson</em></strong>. His ability to run and scramble with the football has sent opposing defenses reeling. People haven&rsquo;t seen a running quarterback like Lamar since the early days of Michael Vick. Working in tandem with <strong><em>Mark Ingram</em></strong> in the backfield has made his runs all the more dangerous as well, as teams have to account for the fact that both Ingram and Jackson can be a runner on any given play.</p>

<p>In terms of receiving weaponry, we have Lamar&rsquo;s favorite tight end in <strong><em>Mark Andrews</em></strong> and his favorite receiver in <strong><em>Marquise &ldquo;Hollywood&rdquo; Brown</em></strong> - the former has ran an impressive 2.89 yards per route run while the latter has served the team well as a traditional X receiver.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hayden Hurst</em></strong> and <strong><em>Nick Boyle</em></strong> are a possible set of names worth mentioning. While it&rsquo;s hard to define either of them as vectors given their lack of numbers and game-changing plays, the Ravens run quite a number of formations with multiple tight ends out there. Hayden Hurst and Nick Boyle are usually those other tight ends out there with Mark Andrews.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, all through the AFC playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Yes. Justin Tucker is still playing like a future hall of famer this year.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Once again, yes. I would actually argue this team has three elite players in the backfield - Earl Thomas, Marcus Peters, and Marlon Humphrey. All three have been recognized this year as Pro Bowlers. On top of that, Peters and Humphrey made made the All-Pro team as well.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>A Super Bowl berth is all but certain here. The only real competition Baltimore might see in the AFC playoffs are the Chiefs, but I have a hard time seeing the Chiefs as a serious threat - their defense lacks the horses to keep the Ravens offense sidelined.</p>

			<p>This shit just don&rsquo;t make no sense. It really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-patriots">Titans @ Patriots</h2>

<p>It seems Tennessee&rsquo;s success on defense came mostly against short-yardage situations and trick plays. The Titans knew the Patriots playbook on those plays - Vrabel leveraged the knowledge he had of New England&rsquo;s habits in these scenarios. Perhaps it&rsquo;s no wonder that Belichick has such a poor record against his assistant coaches compared to his overall record - these coaches know his habits and thought process and know the proper plays to counter them.</p>

<p>If I knew this better, I would have classified the Titans as defensively chess-minded for this game. And that designation would have been enough for me to think twice about taking a side on this game.</p>

<p>And I will never understand why the Patriots were so intent on shutting down the Titans air game early on, despite Ryan Tannehill having a documented history of failure at Gillette Stadium. Derrick Henry is the heart and soul of the offense too - shutting him down early would have forced the Titans to play out of their groove. Steve and Bill Belichick have disappointed me.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-saints">Vikings @ Saints</h2>

<p>It seems evident to me that the Saints phoned this game in. Even though pound-for-pound the Saints are the better team, New Orleans was not fully committed to winning this game, instead possibly looking ahead to the Packers or even the 49ers.</p>

<p>Tackling was poor. The pass rush was nonexistent. Will Lutz missed a kick. Offensive linemen were losing their battles in the trenches. Only Trey Hendricksen and and Taysom Hill seem to have shown up here.</p>

<p>Kevin Stefanski needs to be given credit here though for his playcalling. His plays have made some excellent use of pre-snap motion to throw this Saints defense off their scent. The Vikings also used the Saints initial reads against them on occasion with some great success.</p>

<p>Drew Brees is not an elite quarterback. His arm strength has waned with age. Even if the mind and improvisational skill is there, the physical tools are limited.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Kirk Cousins is playing fairly decent. While his accuracy has presented issues on a few occasions, he&rsquo;s been all right. His ability to pass and roll out to the left has held up excellently into the postseason.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - New Orleans Saints</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Saints are oddly only the 3rd seed in the NFC due to some unfortunate luck when Drew Brees injured his thumb against the Rams and an underprepared Teddy Bridgewater had to step into his place. Even still, New Orleans has been billed as one of the favorites to win. Let&rsquo;s use the  the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a> to see exactly why.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>No doubt. Winning five straight games without Drew Brees alone proves the team can handle hardship. Their comeback win against a surging Titans team in Tennessee is another fine example that exemplifies this team&rsquo;s mental fortitude.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Dennis Allen&rsquo;s tenure as the Saints defensive coach has been largely successful. This year is no different. All three levels of his defense have impressed in one way or another.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes, these Saints have become fixtures in the playoffs, going three years now with postseason outings.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes. Brees continues to break passing records in this league. And unlike last year, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like any nagging injury will be sapping him of his talent.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Sean Payton&rsquo;s a fantastic coach and an even better offensive mind. His ability to scheme up quick passes for Drew Brees has allowed this offense to consistently move the chains on first and second downs instead of third down.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Cameron Jordan</em></strong> can safely be considered an elite pass rusher, given his numbers alone and consistency in production.</p>

<p>While Marcus Davenport, the Saints other starting edge rusher, has been relegated to injured reserve for the season, New Orleans might actually have another man that can step up and pressure the passer on a consistent basis - <strong><em>Demario Davis</em></strong>. Even though Davis has been limited in the number of times he&rsquo;s allowed to rush into the offensive backfield, he&rsquo;s been surprisingly efficient when doing so as of lately. Over the past six weeks, he&rsquo;s tallied up six hits on opposing quarterbacks over 73 rushes. Not too shabby for a middle linebacker.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Saints have at least four different vectors on offense.</p>

<p>The most important one is is <strong><em>Michael Thomas</em></strong>, who earned his billing as the best wide receiver in the NFL this season.</p>

<p><strong><em>Alvin Kamara</em></strong> has still been playing at a high level, even if his numbers are not as impressive as in years past.</p>

<p>The Saints&rsquo; investment in <strong><em>Jared Cook</em></strong> this offseason has paid off in spades, as Drew Brees has found himself a tight end that can run routes along the middle of the field and make tough catches when necessary. In one year, he&rsquo;s become a vital part of the offense, posting over two yards per route run, according to Pro Football Focus.</p>

<p>Lastly, <strong><em>Taysom Hill</em></strong> continues to serve the team well as a utility player who can run all sorts of plays from the quarterback position given his athleticism.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only during the Wild Card round, most likely.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Yes. Will Lutz has been solid this year outside of one bad game against the Bears. I&rsquo;m not sure if the Soldier Field turf played a role in that game though. Either way, his selection to the Pro Bowl this year justifies his consideration as a reliable field goal kicker.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Yes, Marshon Lattimore qualifies here, given his reputation as a shutdown corner.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Saints hold so much promise this year. Though without a bye and real home-field advantage, the Saints still stand as Super Bowl favorites in my book.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Houston Texans</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Texans have limped into the playoffs as the fourth seed in the AFC. Let&rsquo;s use the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a> to see if they can go far in the postseason.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Not sure. The Texans have been great at staging late-game comebacks, even on the road. But Houston is such a bipolar team - it seems every good performance is followed by a bad showing. Great showings against the likes of the Chiefs, Patriots, Saints, and Titans have been accompanied by sad displays against the Jaguars, Broncos, Raiders, and Buccaneers.</p>

<p>It seems this team phones in performances whenever they&rsquo;re significant favorites, similar to the championship Giants of 2011. Except those Giants went through a gauntlet of playoff-caliber teams midway through the season that really helped them adjust mentally to a difficult postseason. The Texans haven&rsquo;t gone through a murderer&rsquo;s row of games this season.</p>

<p>Houston did go through some hardships this season when they lost JJ Watt for half the season. While none of its other pass rushers have stepped up in Watt&rsquo;s absence, the Texans defense were able to compensate with some strong performances from the revamped defensive backfield.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll say yes here though, going off Bill O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s past history.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue yes. Romeo Crennel&rsquo;s willingness to experiment with the blitz and incorporate cast-offs into his defensive backfield says something about his drive to make this defense better. The defense also had a few stellar games this year, most notably against the Patriots in a big prime-time spot and the Jaguars over in London.</p>

<p>One thing does give me pause here - the way the defense has choked away yardage this year compared to years past. It&rsquo;s just not the same defense - this team has been too happy giving up yardage. Then again, maybe Houston can&rsquo;t help itself in this area given the impotence of the pass rush following JJ Watt&rsquo;s chest injury.</p>

<p>Either way, I&rsquo;ll give the benefit of the doubt to Romeo Crennel once again going off history.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes, they do.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Without a doubt. Lamar Jackson aside, Deshaun Watson has been the most electric quarterback this season. The Texans are never out of contention so long as Watson is leading this offense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>No. I see Bill O&rsquo;Brien has more of an appetite this season for experimentation and change, but he still baffles me with his insistence on running offensive concepts that&rsquo;ve been failing more often than not. His blind devotion to inside zone runs and his poor play-action scheming are good examples of concepts that are featured prominently in the playbook even if they haven&rsquo;t proven themselves over long stretches.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>Only one - <strong><em>JJ Watt</em></strong>. As Rivers McCown has noted time and time again in his articles about the Texans this year, nobody else on Houston has stepped up in Watt&rsquo;s absense. Jacob Martin and Whitney Mercilus have shown flashes of brilliance, but neither have been consistent.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Texans feature four different vectors here. Their top receiver is <strong><em>DeAndre Hopkins</em></strong>. His AP All-Pro designation this year speaks for itself. <strong><em>Will Fuller</em></strong> also counts as a vector, given his role as the team&rsquo;s main deep threat. Even though Fuller is a basket case when it comes to injury, his presence on offense makes a serious difference - statistical downturns have been documented when Fuller is missing in action. Even though Fuller will be sidelined for the Wild Card game, I&rsquo;m still counting him as a vector as he may be a factor in the games going forward.</p>

<p>When it comes to the ground game, the Texans are pretty productive with the combo of <strong><em>Carlos Hyde</em></strong> and <strong><em>Duke Johnson</em></strong>. Duke Johnson provides more versatility in the passing game whereas Carlos Hyde has been a workhorse, rushing the ball for over 1000 yards on 245 rushes.  And we can&rsquo;t forget about <strong><em>Deshaun Watson</em></strong> and his ability to scramble as well. In fact, the success of their ground game can be partly traced to teams having to honor Watson&rsquo;s ability to run with the ball.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Not sure. Ka&rsquo;imi Fairbairn seems given to streaks. Not to mention his misses tend to come on the road, which may be an indictment on his composure. He&rsquo;s been absolutely perfect the last six games though (two of which were on the road), so he&rsquo;s on the right track.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give the Texans the benefit of the doubt here and say Fairbairn is reliable enough.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>No. No one defensive back on this team has stood out in my observations on this team.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>While a win over the Bills seems likely, their road to the playoffs will end with a tough loss to Baltimore.</p>

			<h2 id="bills-texans-2-5">Bills @ Texans (-2.5)</h2>

<p>The Texans have the experience and the quarterback while the Bills have the better defense overall and the grit. It&rsquo;s a fair spread, to be honest. I&rsquo;d give the edge to the Texans given it is their home field.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you this though - Josh Allen&rsquo;s inexperience in the playoffs and his mediocre play gives us another opportunity here to bet in favor of the Texans in the 1st half.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bet: Texans 1st Half ML</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-patriots-5">Titans @ Patriots (-5)</h2>

<p>Yes, the Titans have been playing phenomenally with Ryan Tannehill at the helm. But the Titans may have the worst defense this year compared to all the other postseason teams. That and Ryan Tannehill lacks serious playoff experience, making things even more stressful on a Tennessee offense that will be asked to carry the bulk of the workload here in their games.</p>

<p>The Patriots offense has been pretty pathetic this year, but all the other aspects of their team are solid. Their coaches still remain the best in the league as well. Add in home field advantage and you have the recipe for a beatdown here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bet: Patriots (-5)</em></strong></p>
