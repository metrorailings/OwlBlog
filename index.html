	<div class='postTitle'>Rams-Broncos Halftime Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'><p>So I sided with the Broncos (+6.5) here in the SuperContest, expecting a bounce-back from Denver after suffering a humiliating defeat against the Jets. On top of that, I expected the cold weather and thin air to stunt the Rams attack somewhat.</p>

<p>So the Rams are making a living off the ground game here, but the Broncos defense has played <em>just</em> <em>well enough</em> to keep their team in the game. Really, it&rsquo;s the offense here that has completely soured.</p>

<p>Two things are really holding back the Broncos - the offensive line and Case Keenum. Let&rsquo;s start off discussing the former - the weak links on that offensive line are being exposed and the coaches are doing little to try and assist their beleaguered linemen with chips and additional blockers. On one of the few times a halfback actually stayed in the pocket to pass protect, a blitzer still managed to bowl him over for a drive-ending sack.</p>

<p>But really, Case Keenum is the one player holding the team back. His deep throws have been off-mark and ill-advised. I understand that you&rsquo;d want to throw deep against a secondary that has been carved up the past two weeks&hellip;but the Rams coaches have clearly worked on patching up some deficiencies on that side. And Keenum has been unable to alter his game in response. On the few times that a player is open in the backfield, Keenum tends to throw some inaccurate passes.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Colts @ Jets - Halftime Quick Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'><p>So didn&rsquo;t do a Supercontest write-up here, but the Colts (+2.5) were one of my picks And it looked somepromising in the first quarter. Despite an unfortunate pick-six on the second play of the game, Andrew Luck and the Colts were producing yards and moving the ball fairly smoothly through the air.</p>

<p>But the Colts went out of their way to prove that the first turnover was no fluke. A fumble in the second quarter helped the Jets post seven more points on the board. Then an interception (induced by tight man coverage) led to three more points for the Jets prior to the second quarter ending. New York now sits as 10-point leaders going into halftime.</p>

<p>Long story short, the Colts receivers are a truly pathetic bunch. And I include the runningbacks in there as well. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe Indy&rsquo;s skill players decided to coat their gloves with butter for shits and giggles, but the team is having a damn hard time possessing the ball, let alone running free from a Jets secondary that are not world-beaters by any means.</p>

<p>I hope Frank Reich is verbally whupping some ass in the locker room as I type this.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 5 Supercontest Picks</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'><p>A 3-2 result last week&hellip;not too shabby. It could have been a 5-0 had a couple plays rolled out a bit better for me! But then again, the 3-2 record was justified to be frank. I try to avoid picking games where the outcome of the game (relative to the spread) is still uncertain in its final minutes.</p>

<p>The real sharps should be picking games where a resolution is comfortably reached well before the game ends. And I was able to do that on three different instances last week, thankfully. I feel as if I&rsquo;m getting my mojo back.</p>

<p>This week though&hellip;it&rsquo;s going to be a little difficult. I feel very confident <strong>only</strong> in two of my picks.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="denver-broncos-new-york-jets-1">Denver Broncos @ <em>New York Jets (-1)</em></h5>

<p>Quite a few people were shocked when this line was initially revealed. How could a fairly promising team like the Broncos be one-point underdog against a Jets team that&rsquo;s been humiliated three damn weeks in a row? Even my Elo model has the Jets pinned as slim underdogs.</p>

<p>Well, here&rsquo;s one of the reasons why - teams that have sustained consecutive losses are more likely to bounce back, provided the spot is right. And this spot should be right. Denver has to travel across two time zones on a short week for an early afternoon game. So I do not expect the Broncos to be playing at full potential, especially coming off a big primetime showing against a division rival.</p>

<p>On a bit of a different note, this Broncos team disappoints me for a couple different reasons. One, the team&rsquo;s head coach and its offensive coordinator have failed to field a serviceable offense for the past year and a half, which is unacceptable given that they have a proven commodity at quarterback. Second, Von Miller has had two consecutive games now where he&rsquo;s failed to do much. It&rsquo;s beginning to worry me, considering he&rsquo;s supposed to be a first-class edge rusher. Maybe those two games were just a blip&hellip;or maybe those two games were indicative that something is off with Von Miller this year. This game will determine which of those two statements is true.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="los-angeles-rams-7-seattle-seahawks"><em>Los Angeles Rams (-7)</em> @ Seattle Seahawks</h5>

<p>This may be my shakiest pick. Even my Elo model is screaming for me to side with the Seahawks here.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way that hot teams are hot for a reason. Every season, we have at least one team catch fire and burn through opposing teams on their schedule, covering spreads repeatedly in the process. The Panthers pulled this feat off three years ago. Then the Cowboys were the &ldquo;it&rdquo; team two years ago. And then the Eagles were the hot team last year. Now the Rams look to be that team spitting hot fire this year. And I hope this team steamrolls a Seahawks defense that&rsquo;s clearly in a rebuilding phase. Sure, Russell Wilson and his skill players can step up and start notching points on the scoreboard to keep up with the Rams, but that offense under Schotty looks&hellip;lost. It doesn&rsquo;t have that same scrappy attitude that I&rsquo;ve seen from the past couple years. And that bodes well for my Rams pick here!</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="minnesota-vikings-philadelphia-eagles-3">Minnesota Vikings @ <em>Philadelphia Eagles (-3)</em></h5>

<p>On the other hand, this is my <strong><em>best</em></strong> pick this week. I&rsquo;m so confident in this pick that I&rsquo;ll be betting more than five units on this.</p>

<p>Literally, little has changed between these two teams since their postseason meeting last year. The only real change is at quarterback. Whereas the Eagles are fielding a better passer this time around in Carson Wentz, the Vikings have slid backwards a bit with Kirk Cousins helming the offense. Think about that - despite starting a lesser quarterback, the Eagles managed to blow the Vikings out last season.</p>

<p>And now, the Eagles are only laying a field goal here, even though Philadelphia will now be the team fielding the better passer. On top of that, the Eagles are coming back home off an emotional loss, which makes this a great spot for them.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="dallas-cowboys-houston-texans-3">Dallas Cowboys @ <em>Houston Texans (-3)</em></h5>

<p>The Cowboys and Texans are meeting in an exciting match, at least to me.</p>

<p>To my surprise, people seem to be taking the Cowboys&rsquo; prospects seriously in this match-up. And I don&rsquo;t know why. Yes, the Cowboys have the better defense here, but the Texans feature the <em>better quarterback</em> here. And playing on home field in primetime should juice up that Texans pass rush, which should hopefully mask the deficiencies in their defensive backfield. Then again, even if Houston was fielding corpses to man the secondary, does it honestly even matter? Dak Prescott and his wide receivers have yet to discover a consistent passing game.</p>

<p>Ezekiel Elliott will find ways to eat up yards in this game. But it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine a runningback alone keeping his team in contention. Maybe the Cowboys defense steps up and keeps the Texans attack at bay. But at home in primetime, I&rsquo;m willing to put money on Houston.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="washington-redskins-6-5-new-orleans-saints"><em>Washington Redskins</em> <em>(+6.5)</em> @ New Orleans Saints</h5>

<p>Frankly, the Redskins may be too undervalued here. I understand the Saints are a highly proficient team on offense, but the team showed some limits on offense last week against the Giants. Don&rsquo;t let their score fool you - the Saints were largely bottled up for much of the game. It was only from Alvin Kamara&rsquo;s heroics that the Saints were able to drive the score upwards. Michael Thomas spent a good bit of the game bracketed in coverage, leaving Brees without much in terms of receivers. Drew Brees is relying on Michael Thomas as a crutch. So long as Washington can blanket Thomas, Brees will struggle at points.</p>

<p>More importantly, Washington (under Jay Gruden) has a bit of a tendency to respond well when they&rsquo;re big underdogs. Considering that this is a primetime match-up, I expect the Redskins to be more than ready for the Saints in this game. A win may be a stretch, but a cover here looks good to me.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 4 Supercontest Picks</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'><p>I do not like to waste time, so let&rsquo;s kick off this blog by keeping people current on my upcoming SuperContest weeks.</p>

<p>FYI, my Westgate SuperContest record is 6-9-0. It blows, I know&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="houston-texans-indianapolis-colts-1">Houston Texans @ <em>Indianapolis Colts (-1)</em></h5>

<p>The Texans were gobsmacked by the Giants last week. Despite New York fielding its worst pass rush over the last couple years, the Giants were able to rough Deshaun Watson up on several occasions. If that isn&rsquo;t enough to convince you this Houston offensive line is a damned mess, then consider that this offensive line is blamed for surrendering 50 quarterback pressures over the past 3 weeks, according to Pro Football Focus.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to fix a bad offensive line, particularly against good pass rushers. And the Colts feature a solid bunch of them in Jabaal Sheard, Darius Leonard, and Margus Hunt, the last of whom is well on his way to being considered elite.</p>

<p>On offense, the Colts suck. It&rsquo;s clear Andrew Luck is still held back by his shoulder, given his lousy yards-per-pass stat. But the team has demonstrated that they could still win, even with a noodle-armed Luck under center.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="san-francisco-49ers-10-san-diego-los-angeles-chargers"><em>San Francisco 49ers</em> <em>(+10)</em> @ <del>San Diego</del> Los Angeles Chargers</h5>

<p>Is Jimmy Garoppalo really worth 6 points against the spread? I don&rsquo;t think so&hellip;.but the next few weeks will truly reveal whether Jimmy G&rsquo;s absence truly impacts this team&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<p>My hunch tells me C.J. Beathard should be able to fill in serviceably. It&rsquo;s worth noting that his sorry numbers from last year can be somewhat excused as he was an unpolished third-round rookie. Spending a full year in Shanahan&rsquo;s system should help him better manage this offense.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it helps he&rsquo;ll be making his season debut against the Chargers, a team incapable of rushing the passer without its star edge rusher, Joey Bosa. And on top of that, the 49ers should be able to grind out quality yards against a team that has struggled to contain the run.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="new-york-jets-jacksonville-jaguars-7-5">New York Jets @ <em>Jacksonville Jaguars (-7.5)</em></h5>

<p>Ah&hellip;.the Jets. The team has lost its mojo after that phenomenal showing against the Lions to open the season. It took two consecutive poor performances to remind us that Sam Darnold is going to have to go through some growing pains as he adjusts to life in the NFL.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for him, this is not a good spot for the young man to righten himself. This Jaguars defense is particularly vicious when they play in Jacksonville. I don&rsquo;t expect Darnold to maintain his composure for long.</p>

<p>Now if Bortles actually bothered to study game tape this week, Jacksonville&rsquo;s offense may actually be productive this week. I would hope the man shows up to play after a horrendous outing last week against the Titans.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="kansas-city-chiefs-denver-broncos-5">Kansas City Chiefs @ <em>Denver Broncos (+5)</em></h5>

<p>This is an Elo pick. My Elo ratings seem to indicate that Vegas is overrating the Chiefs by <em>at least</em> 5 points in this game. Which make sense. The bookmakers know well enough that the betting public loves to hammer teams with sensational offenses. A Monday night game featuring an offensive juggernaut is going to attract quite a few bettors, no doubt.</p>

<p>With Denver coming off a terrible overall performance and playing at home in primetime, I am convinced the Broncos hold the emotional edge over the Chiefs here. I expect some good things from these Von Miller, Case Keenum, and the rest of their fellow Broncos on Monday.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="detroit-lions-dallas-cowboys-3">Detroit Lions @ <em>Dallas Cowboys (-3)</em></h5>

<p>A pick that I feel is correct subjectively and from an Elo standpoint. The current spread essentially declares both the Lions and the Cowboys as equal. And honestly&hellip;that&rsquo;s too much of an overreaction from last week, when the Cowboys floundered pathetically while the Lions won triumphantly in front of a national audience. The Cowboys are still pretty damn good at running the ball with Ezekiel Elliott, and the Lions are frankly awful at slowing down opposing rushers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Lions are coming off an emotional high whereas the Cowboys are coming off an emotional low. If there&rsquo;s any team that has reason to play harder this week, it would be the Cowboys.</p>

<hr />

<p>One thing worth noting&hellip;my first week of the Supercontest, I went 3-2. My second week, 2-3. And last week&hellip;1-4. If mathematical trends are truly a thing in gambling&hellip;.god help me.</p>
