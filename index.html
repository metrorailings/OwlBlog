<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Tom Brady</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Julian Edelman (WR), James White (RB), Sony Michel (RB), Antonio Brown (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Josh Gordon (WR), Demaryius Thomas (WR), Cameron Meredith (WR), N’Keal Harry (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Michael Bennett (DE), Devin McCourty (FS), Patrick Chung (SS), Dont’a Hightower (LB), Kyle Van Noy (OLB), Stephon Gilmore (CB), Jamie Collins (OLB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Bill Belichick (HC/GM), Josh McDaniels (OC), Greg Schiano Jerod Mayo (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, the biggest change comes with wide receivers coach Chad O’Shea leaving the team to go become the offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins. Joe Judge, the special teams coordinator, will now be coaching the wide receivers in his stead. Add in a few new assistants and that about sums up the changes on the offensive coaching staff.</p>

<p>On defense, we have a rocky situation. With Brian Flores departing the team to go be the new head coach for the Dolphins, Greg Schiano was hired in the offseason to take over coordinator duties. However, Schiano abruptly vacated his post due to some family issues, leaving the Patriots without a coordinator at defense. Belichick apparently entrusted play-calling duties to longtime former Patriot Jerod Mayo, who actually played with some of the folks on the current roster not too long ago. Whether this move pans out remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The changes on the defensive coaching staff don’t end there, however. We have new coaches this year overlooking the linebackers and the defensive line, Mayo being one of them. The organization also promoted an assistant from last year to coach the cornerbacks now that the former cornerbacks coach left to go join Flores in Miami. It’s worth noting that none of these coaches were fired - all the coaches from last year that left did so voluntarily.</p>

<hr />

<p>The reigning champions can still defend their crown this year. Despite losing a whole boatload of assistant coaches and losing some key elements of their roster from last year, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady will find ways to win games.</p>

<p>A couple things worth watching here&hellip;first, we must see whether Josh Gordon can actually stay active for an entire season. If Gordon can ward off his inner demons and stay active on this roster for the regular season, New England will finally have a receiver that can dominate outside the numbers. Maybe the Patriots wouldn’t even miss Gronk so much, as Gronk was the one player on their team capable of winning against defenders with physicality alone.</p>

<p>Second, we need to see whether the defensive line can pressure the quarterback somewhat consistently now that Trey Flowers is no longer with the team. The Patriots smartly negotiated a trade for Michael Bennett during the offseason though. While the aging Bennett will probably not give the team as much as Flowers would have had he stayed, the man can still play at an elite level more often than not. Furthermore, the organization also brought Jamie Collins back into the fold. Before the Patriots dealt him to Cleveland a few years back, Collins was the best on that team at pressuring quarterbacks. While the wear and tear of football has likely worn down some of his potential, it’s possible that Belichick and the defensive coaches can train him back to notable form.</p>

<p>Third (and most important), we need to see whether Tom Brady starts to slow down. During the Super Bowl earlier in the year, Brady looked every bit like a 40 year-old quarterback. I can’t help but wonder then&hellip;was that a harbinger of things to come or was that simply a blip? Signs seem to indicate that Brady’s still able to ball as a starting quarterback, but I can’t shake this feeling that the man is in the midst of a steep decline. It’s possible that Brady is at that phase of his career where pass protection is absolutely crucial for him to function well. At this point, hits and sacks rattle him more than ever. If opposing defenses can harangue him, Brady could start breaking down mentally. If that happens, that will be the end of this Patriots dynasty.</p>

<p>Even though a few things do concern me, I still have this team ranked as a top-tier team, mostly out of respect to Belichick. It also helps that the Patriots play in a division where all the other teams are still pretty awful. I expect New England to slide into the playoffs with a high seed. Whether they advance to yet another Super Bowl depends mostly on Brady and the number of skill players that show up on offense as reliable vectors.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>The Patriots were able to scoop up Antonio Brown after he was released from the Raiders. So long as Belichick keeps the rowdy head case in line, the Patriots finally have an outside receiver that can dominate outside the numbers. Pair him up with Josh Gordon and New England may have the best set of receivers in the game today. It&rsquo;s so unfair.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-8"><strong><em>Tier 8</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Josh Rosen, Ryan Fitzpatrick</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>N/A</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Kenyan Drake (RB), DeVante Parker (WR), Dwayne Allen (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Christian Wilkins (DT), Xavien Howard (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Chris Grier (GM), Brian Flores (New HC), Chad O’Shea (New OC), Patrick Graham (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 4.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, only the running backs coach was spared from the inevitable overhaul that came when Brian Flores assumed head coaching duties following the firing of Adam Gase.</p>

<p>Similarly on defense, only the defensive backs coach from last year survived the regime change, though the man will only be responsible for the safeties this season.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nothing to expect here but another losing season. The Dolphins are truly bereft of talent across all aspects of their roster.</p>

<p>However, it seems the coaches are consciously going out of their way to deconstruct this roster. The team is initiating a rebuild following years of mediocrity under Adam Gase - new coach Brian Flores has let the team’s biggest free-agents walk this offseason without replacing any of them, save for a few players brought over from his alma mater in New England. The Dolphins’ brain trust has committed themselves wholesale to the idea of a multi-year rebuild, even going as far as trading away franchise quarterback Ryan Tannehill and star left tackle Laremy Tunsil for additional draft capital.</p>

<p>Still, it’s not as if the Dolphins are looking to bomb the season away. Miami traded a second round pick to Arizona in exchange for first-round passing prospect Josh Rosen. While Rosen didn’t really impress much last year, keep in mind the kid wasn’t given much help from his coaches - first year head coach Steve Wilks and offensive coordinator Mike McCoy were so awful at their jobs that the Cardinals executives were forced to blow apart the coaching staff for a second straight year. On top of that, the Cardinals fielded one of the worst offensive lines last season. And rookie quarterbacks without protection are practically guaranteed to fail. So with all that said, it’s not too outlandish to say Rosen has the potential to be the team’s new franchise quarterback. Luckily, the Dolphins spent comparatively little in acquiring Rosen, so Miami can move on from the second-year passer should he fail to pan out this season.</p>

<p>Concisely put, Miami will be going through the motions this year. Nothing much is expected of them this season, but that’s all right.</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<h2 id="tier-6"><strong><em>Tier 6</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Josh Allen</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Josh Allen (Mobile QB), LeSean McCoy (RB), Zay Jones (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Cole Beasley (WR), John Brown (WR), Tyler Kroft (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Lorenzo Alexander (OLB), Jerry Hughes (DE), Micah Hyde (SS), Tre’Davious White (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Brandon Beane (GM), Sean McDermott (HC), Brian Daboll (OC), Leslie Frazier (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, we actually see quite a bit of turnover here. Which makes sense, given that the offense was damn near comical last year. Quarterbacks, wide receivers, and offensive linemen now report to new coaches this year.</p>

<p>On defense, though, we see the exact opposite - the entire coaching staff has been retained from last year.</p>

<hr />

<p>Buffalo’s first season with quarterback Josh Allen went just about as expected. The analytics experts were right to criticize the rookie before the season even started - his deep ball accuracy is atrocious. Sometimes the ball doesn’t even land in the same country as its intended receiver.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not much improvement is to be expected in the second year. It’s said that quarterbacks rarely improve their accuracy coming out of college. And I’m inclined to believe that - it takes a certain instinctual sense to throw a football at a moving target with reasonable accuracy. Either you have that gift or you don’t. It’s safe to say Josh Allen never had that gift. Any success he experienced as a passer almost certainly came as a result of his legs instead of his arms. His athleticism is simply freakish - few defenses had answers for his scrambles and designed runs as the kid managed to average roughly seven yards over eighty-nine runs last season. But football games cannot be won consistently through quarterback mobility alone. You need some semblance of a passing game to prevent defenses from stacking the box and stationing defenders closer to the line of scrimmage. Sometime this season, Allen will need to show his mettle and pass the ball for this Bills offense to be productive.</p>

<p>On a positive note, the Bills organization seems to be making the right moves from a personnel perspective. Taking their cue from the Patriots, Buffalo inked several mid-level veterans in the offseason to team-friendly contracts. Brandon Beane and Sean McDermott seem intent on stocking the team with homegrown talent and reasonably-priced players with experience. Not a bad way to build the team given the situation at quarterback - if the Bills insist on Josh Allen being the future face of the franchise, then the team needs to cycle through skill players in order to find the select few capable of working in tandem with Allen. And you can’t bring new players into the fold so easily when a few big names on your roster dominate the salary cap.</p>

<p>Buffalo’s outlook this season isn’t great. Unless the team is blessed with some luck, I expect Josh Allen to lead these Bills to another losing record.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Sam Darnold</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Robby Anderson (WR), Le’Veon Bell (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Jamison Crowder (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Leonard Williams (DE), Quinnen Williams (DE), C.J. Mosley (LB), Jamal Adams (SS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Joe Douglas (New GM), Adam Gase (New HC), Dowell Loggains (New OC), Gregg Williams (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 7</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Nearly every single coach on the staff this year is new. Interestingly enough, only the two defensive back coaches from last year managed to survive the complete overhaul of the Jets organization this year.</p>

<hr />

<p>Not to give myself a pat on the back here, but my assessment from last year was spot-on. The Jets sunk quickly last season due to a lack of talent at key positions along with several rocky performances from a rookie quarterback trying to find his groove. The former general manager Mike Maccagnan went big in free agency in the offseason, dumping out the team’s purse on players like Le’Veon Bell, Jamison Crowder, and C.J. Mosley. It seemed almost as if this year was intended to be that great leap forward into relevancy for the franchise. But soon after the draft, Maccagnan was ousted along with his personnel director in a move many described as sloppy. But honestly, it might have been the right move, despite the bad timing.</p>

<p>The reality is that Maccagnan and his personnel man were only committed to making splashy moves, often at the expense of team culture, draft picks, and salary cap space. The signing of Le’Veon Bell best exemplified their foolishness. It was frankly a stupid move handing out all that cash to a running back that hasn’t been playing football for over a year. And it’s all the more stupid considering the messy circumstances under which Bell left Pittsburgh. It was much less a move made by a professional general manager and more a move made by an impulsive fan that only cares about winning immediately. On a positive note though, hiring Joe Douglas to take over general manager duties from Maccagnan was a smart move, according to Michael Lombardi. Douglas understands team culture and the fundamentals of building a team capable of long-term success.</p>

<p>That being said, the unfortunate truth is that it’ll take a year or two for this team to recover from Maccagnan’s bad decisions. Le’Veon Bell’s contract makes him way too expensive to release any time soon, meaning Gase will have to work to mitigate any dysfunction his presence may sow inside the locker room. Trumaine Johnson will still be a black spot on this roster for at least one more year given the outsized value of his contract as well. More importantly though, Gase has his work cut out for him - Maccagnan left this team undermanned for the better part of his tenure. This year’s personnel’s moves went a long way to correcting some of the deficiencies on the roster, but work is still needed&hellip;especially along the receiver corps.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Super Bowl LIII - Prediction</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>It&rsquo;s all come down to this&hellip;.the Los Angeles Rams versus the New England Patriots. What a shitty Super Bowl.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the pieces I wrote recently on both teams, I&rsquo;ve focused on a few things - the coaching and the pass rush. And I&rsquo;ve come to one conclusion&hellip;the Rams may have a slightly more talented team, but the Patriots are the more efficient team.</p>

<p>For Los Angeles to win, they need sensational performances from Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh. Why is that? Well frankly, I don&rsquo;t think Jared Goff and his offense will be able to keep pace with New England in terms of scoring. Therefore, the Rams will need defensive stops here to keep this game within reach. And the best way to cull Patriot drives short is to sack and harass Brady in the pocket. That being said, the Rams only have one fantastic pass rusher on their team in Donald. And typically, you need multiple elite defensive linemen to regularly harangue Brady, as Belichick and his coaching staff are usually apt at limiting the opposing team&rsquo;s best pass rusher. So as a result, this game rests in Suh&rsquo;s hands&hellip;and I&rsquo;m not that convinced of Suh&rsquo;s potential to wreak havoc here, despite his performance over the last two games. His regular season numbers are a little too pedestrian for me to confidently declare him as a reliable pass rusher, especially against offensive lines as stout as that of the Patriots.</p>

<p>While people can point out that the Eagles still won the championship last year without harassing Brady much, that Philadelphia team had three things going in their favor - an elite quarterback, more offensive weaponry, and the best defensive line in the league. Philly managed to keep pace with the Patriots on offense, posting over 500 yards on offense. Despite that, the Patriots were still on their way to claiming their sixth championship until Brandon Graham managed to blow past a guard and strip sack Brady, guaranteeing Philadelphia its first Super Bowl victory. So the pass rush still ultimately mattered, even if it played a much lesser role here than in other Super Bowls the Patriots have lost. Philadelphia had that luxury of not having to rely so much on its pass rush thanks to some brilliant performances from their offensive players. I&rsquo;m not sure if the Rams could count on their offense carrying them should their defense fail to generate stops.</p>

<p>Sean McVay is a football genius, but even he can only do so much with Jared Goff as his quarterback and his best skill player injured for the rest of the season. That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m declaring Cooper Kupp as the best skill player on that team. A little while ago, I would have found it preposterous that anybody but Todd Gurley can be declared as the most important player on the Rams offense&hellip;but ever since he suffered that bizarre injury in the game against the Chiefs, the man has not been the same. His role on the team has been supplanted by C.J. Anderson, who McVay essentially recognizes as the team&rsquo;s lead halfback at this point. Sure, Gurley&rsquo;s had two weeks now to recover even more, but I&rsquo;m not sure if he&rsquo;ll even be close to top form in time for the Super Bowl - honestly, it might take a whole offseason for the man to completely rehabilitate himself!</p>

<p>But even if McVay had an elite quarterback and more weapons on offense, could he match wits with Belichick? Possibly&hellip;but he needs to work more on his game management skills. Over the last couple games, I&rsquo;ve seen him make some awful decisions on fourth down. On two separate occasions, the man made some bizarre calls on fourth-and-short situations. Even though the games ultimately panned out for the Rams, it still worries me that the man made these strange decisions in the first place. Still, I do think McVay has the chops to outplay Belichick, so long as he has the horses on offense.</p>

<p>But he doesn&rsquo;t. If anything, his horses are on defense. But the defense is critically limited at its most important function - the pass rush. And that is the reason I&rsquo;m going with the Patriots here to win Super Bowl LIII.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Analyzing the Rams Pass Rush Against the Packers</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>One of the biggest factors determining which team wins in the Super Bowl is the pass rush. Almost always, the team with the better overall pass rush ends up hoisting the Lombardi trophy when the game is over. So let&rsquo;s evaluate the overall efficacy of the Rams pass rush relative to the Patriots pass rush.</p>

<p>We do this by studying their games against common opponents. We look only for those common opponents that played both teams at roughly the same point in the season. In this case, the Rams and Patriots only have one such common opponent - the Packers. New England and Los Angeles played Green Bay literally a week apart from one another. Both games were also played on their respective home fields, so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about controlling for home field advantage.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sacks</strong>: 3</p>

<p><strong>Hits</strong>: 6</p>

<p><strong>Hurries</strong>: 6</p>

<p><strong>Thrown Away / Batted Passes</strong>: 0</p>

<p><strong>Passes Attempted:</strong> 34</p>

<p><strong>Negligible Passes:</strong> 4</p>

<hr />

<p>Aaron Rodgers was involved in 34 total pass-eligible plays in the game. 4 of those plays were passes that Rodgers threw less than one second after receiving the snap, so we could factor them out of the equation here.</p>

<p>So that being said&hellip;Los Angeles&rsquo; pressure score becomes <strong><em>0.45.</em></strong> An excellent score in fact. Better than the Patriots. A little concerning for New England backers.</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Rather than do quick statements discussing the Patriots and their victory over Kansas City to retain possession of the AFC crown&hellip;I&rsquo;ll be doing a deep dive here in order to more correctly illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this New England team as they head into the Super Bowl.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="1st-quarter">1st Quarter</h4>

<p>The first play of the day sets the tone for the Patriots on offense. Against a seven-man box, Sony Michel still manages to chew off 11 yards behind some excellent blocks by his offensive linemen, his fullback James Develin, and tight end Rob Gronkowski. And now it begins to dawn on me - what good is a fantastic pass rush if the defensive line is completely inept at stopping the run?</p>

<p>That first drive was just domination by the Patriots. The Chiefs had forced New England into a 3rd and long position near the end of the drive, but for some awful reason, the Chiefs decided to put their best edge rusher in coverage against the Patriots&rsquo; best receiver. Even though Dee Ford was able to hold his own against Julian Edelman for a few seconds, the Chiefs&rsquo; neutered pass rush was unable to even so much as breathe on Tom Brady, allowing for an easy completion over the middle.</p>

<p>Poor coaching will be a repeated emphasis here. People have ridiculed Andy Reid for his record of failure in the postseason. Some have even theorized that the man is simply unable to lead a team to the promised land. And I&rsquo;m starting to believe that. Andy Reid and Bob Sutton were thoroughly out-coached here, as I&rsquo;ll point out time and time again.</p>

<p>On the Chiefs&rsquo; first drive, I think it&rsquo;s becoming clear Patrick Mahomes is racked by nerves coming into this match. Why is he insisting on throwing the ball to Sammy Watkins twice in a row? On that first play, Travis Kelce was more open than Watkins. On the second play, Watkins was held in check by the Patriots&rsquo; best cornerback in Stephon Gilmore. I understand Tyreek Hill is being blanketed in double coverage, but then the next man up should be either Travis Kelce or your speedy halfback in Damien Williams&hellip;.not Sammy &lsquo;asshat&rsquo; Watkins.</p>

<p>I think the Patriots have keyed in on an awful tendency in Mahomes&rsquo; passing game - the sophomore quarterback is addicted to throwing the ball deep. Take away his best deep threat in Tyreek Hill and he&rsquo;ll respond by targeting Sammy Watkins instead. It makes sense - Watkins is supposed to the other skill player complimenting Hill in the deep passing offense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to Andy Reid to iron this tendency out from his young quarterback, but it&rsquo;s clear the veteran coach has not yet fixed this aspect of Mahomes&rsquo; game. It&rsquo;s still not too late to make Patrick see the error of his ways, but as we&rsquo;ll see, very little will change as we progress in this game.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hits on Mahomes: 2</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="2nd-quarter">2nd Quarter</h4>

<p>The first Chiefs drive this quarter saw the Patriots pressuring Mahomes on two plays. Despite that, Kansas City was in a position to move the chains, but Damien Williams failed to punch ahead for one yard on 3rd down.</p>

<p>The second Chiefs drive could have ended in a touchdown. After a beautiful bomb to Tyreek Hill, Kansas City was in prime scoring position. On the very next play, the Patriots called a six-man blitz, leaving all the skill players in single coverage situations. Had Patrick Mahomes thrown a slightly better ball, Damien Williams would have had a touchdown reception here. Instead, it seems New England&rsquo;s pass rushers were able to suffocate pocket just enough to compel Mahomes into throwing an awkward pass. The result will go down as an incompletion, but it really was a missed opportunity to tie up the game against New England. On third down, the Patriots called yet another blitz that finally hit home and resulted in a sack that took Kansas out of field goal range. It was a sad end to the Chiefs&rsquo; most promising drive up to this point.</p>

<p>New England, meanwhile, was able to move the ball seemingly at will. Luckily, two of their drives in the quarter ended with no points, thanks to bad plays from Tom Brady and James White. The former threw a silly interception in the end zone and the latter couldn&rsquo;t reel in a screen pass that would have likely gone for significant yardage.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what though, that last New England drive was a master class in coaching. Not only did the Patriots commit to running the ball in order to wipe as much time off the clock as possible, but New England made fools out of this Kansas City defensive line on two occasions with well-timed screens. Once again, I have to emphasize the coaching here - the Patriots have some phenomenal coaches here. I have to commend them for instilling some discipline here in their their defensive players - the Patriots box defenders rarely fell for Kansas City&rsquo;s attempts at misdirection and trickery.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hits on Mahomes: 4</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="3rd-quarter">3rd Quarter</h4>

<p>The Chiefs fire out of the gate with a four-play touchdown drive. Most notably, Mahomes wasn&rsquo;t touched even once on this drive, not even on a critical 3rd down when the Patriots only sent three rushers to try and pressure him. A big pass to Sammy Watkins despite Stephon Gilmore in coverage put the Chiefs in the red zone. Then the next play was well-designed - Travis Kelce was positioned on the right while Tyreek Hill was stationed to the left of Mahomes. Knowing the Patriots would send their safety to Hill&rsquo;s side of the field, Andy Reid essentially schemed things so that Kelce would only be guarded by one defensive back. It didn&rsquo;t take long for Travis to win his match-up and catch the ball for a touchdown.</p>

<p>One thing that&rsquo;s becoming clear to me as I watch the Chiefs this quarter is that Bob Sutton finally made some adjustments on defense to slow down the Patriots&rsquo; rushing attack. Sutton now has three of his men lining up as tackles along the middle of the line of the scrimmage. It&rsquo;s much harder for the Patriots to gain any leverage in runs now. However, the additional reinforcement along th edefensive line comes at the expense of the linebackers&rsquo; corps - instead of fielding two players as conventional linebackers, the Chiefs now only field only one player behind their defensive linemen.</p>

<p>On the last play of the 3rd quarter, Mahomes missed Kelce on what would have been a fairly easy touchdown. To be fair though, his target was open as well, but that throw was significantly more difficult to make. Kelce literally ran across the formation into empty space behind two other receivers running their routes. A simple lob in his direction was all that was needed for a touchdown on that play.</p>

<h4 id="4th-quarter">4th Quarter</h4>

<p>Watching the 4th quarter, it&rsquo;s clearly becoming evident to me that the Chiefs defensive line is turning into a vulnerability. The problem with the Chiefs is that the line is only capable of two modes - run stopping mode and pass rush mode. When the line tightens up with bigger bodies towards the middle, the Chiefs become effective defensing the run, but the pass rush loses its teeth. When the line widens into a more traditional four-man look and the Chiefs have all their stud defensive linemen out there, Kansas becomes effective rushing the passer, but then the rush defense loses virtually all of its efficacy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s dawning on me that I overrated this Chiefs defensive line. After all, what good is a phenomenal pass rush if the defensive line and the linebackers behind them are completely inept in containing opposing rushers? Therefore, any analysis I conduct in the future on a playoff team&rsquo;s defense has to account for their ability to stop the run with their box players.</p>

<p>By the way, if I haven&rsquo;t mentioned this before, then I&rsquo;ll bring it up here - Sony Michel has played mostly terrific this game. His decision making  and cuts have been on point so far. It appears the rookie is finally realizing some of that first-round potential.</p>

<p>Following the Patriots giving the ball up on downs several minutes into the fourth quarter, the Chiefs had an opportunity to finally gain some momentum. All they needed was a successful drive from their offense that ends in some points. But what we get instead is a three-and-out. A failed run on first down and two poor passes from Mahomes put a quick kibosh on the drive. Really, Mahomes is worrying me here. It&rsquo;s clear as hell that the Patriots were in a Cover-0 formation on 3rd down, but the Chiefs signal caller was awkwardly late throwing the ball to Tyreek Hill. Had he recognized that Hill was in a position to exploit the defense immediately after the snap, he could have actually moved the chains here with a quick sideways pass to Hill.</p>

<p>The Chiefs catch another break, as an errant pass by Brady results in an interception. On the second play, Reid finally dialed up a beautiful play, moving Mahomes to the right only to have him throw the ball against the grain to the left side of the field to a wide open Damien Williams. Running behind three offensive linemen, the rookie rusher sauntered into the end zone.</p>

<p>With the Chiefs now ahead, the opportunity is there to close out the game. And now, <strong><em>finally</em></strong>, the Chiefs opt to play some good defense. Aggressive press coverage against the Patriots receivers forces Brady to hold on to the ball a touch longer. Unfortunately, the pass rush is unable to hit home. Granted, you have a few players coming close here and there, but Brady still has far too much time in the pocket to breathe comfortably. It&rsquo;s worth noting Chris Jones is sidelined at this point with injury, so the only stud rushers lining up along the line are Justin Houston and Dee Ford. Still, neither one  of these two are slouches, so Kansas shouldn&rsquo;t be having much issue nailing Brady. The problem is that these defenders are being chipped or outright  stone-walled by multiple Patriot blockers. As a result, neither of these edge rushers are unable to even work the pocket until it&rsquo;s too late. The coaches aren&rsquo;t helping much either - neither Houston nor Ford are straying from their wide-nine position. Edge blitzes aren&rsquo;t being called much either.</p>

<p>It also hurts that Tom Brady is playing his best football to close out the game. Without much of a rushing game to carry the offense, the team vested their faith in Brady&rsquo;s arm. And that trust paid off tremendously, as Brady made some key throws to receivers like Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan and Rob Gronkowski to keep the chains moving. Within the red zone, the Patriots were able to count on Sony Michel punching the ball across the goal line on two separate occasions.</p>

<p>The Chiefs answered back with their own scores and a field goal to tie the game up, but a favorable coin toss put the ball back in Brady&rsquo;s hands in overtime. The rest is history. Overtime does not need to be discussed here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hits on Mahomes: 3</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>This game hurts me. The Chiefs are the better team from a roster perspective. Playing on their own turf should have given Kansas a decisive advantage here. I was almost certain the Patriots would need some ridiculous luck to pull out a victory here.</p>

<p>But it turns out it would be bad coaching from the Chiefs brass that would allow New England to steal a win here. Andy Reid and Bob Sutton were truly derelict in their coaching duties here - whatever game plan they drew up earlier in the week was clearly ineffective from the get-go. Strategic adjustments were usually made far too late to have any considerable impact. The Patriots clearly gained a beat on where the Chiefs were vulnerable and attacked those weak points with heartless abandon.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s becoming evident to me that Andy Reid is a truly unfit coach come playoff time. The man had so many things align well this season and he still managed to squander any championship hopes his team may have had.</p>
