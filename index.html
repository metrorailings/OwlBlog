			<h2 id="texans-ravens">Texans @ Ravens</h2>

<p>Matthew Judon dominating against the run and at taking down the quarterback.</p>

<p>Deshaun Watson seems to be leaning too heavily on DeAndre Hopkins in the passing game. Lots of slants and even a deep heave in his direction on a critical 4th down play.</p>

<p>Ravens&rsquo; defensive line has been a little sloppy with their aggressiveness. One bad penalty sustained an ultimately fruitless Texans drive.</p>

<p>Houston&rsquo;s pass rush is nonexistent, as expected. Mercilus, Reader, nor Brennan Scarlet.</p>

<p>The Ravens and their cadre of tight ends are unique in this league. Mark Andrews catching a touchdown pass against a cornerback demonstrates his value as a pass catcher.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-buccaneers">Saints @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Once again, Brees and Thomas haven&rsquo;t missed a beat with their connection whenever the latter runs flat routes.</p>

<p>A bungled snap from Jameis nearly cost the Buccaneers a possession one yard away from the end zone. Luckily, the sack created additional space for the Tampa Bay offense that allowed Jameis to slide the ball towards a halfback running a post route against a linebacker for a touchdown.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting studying this game to see if the Saints can work out of negative game script given Brees and his penchant for the short ball.</p>

			<h4 id="saints-buccaneers-5-5"><em>Saints</em> @ Buccaneers (+5.5)</h4>

<p>Not the biggest fan of taking road favorites, but the Saints are coming off a horrific loss to an opponent that really had no standing to beat them. New Orleans clearly lost focus coming off the bye. That focus should be in place after the loss.</p>

<p>Now cue this game against the Buccaneers. As I noted before, Tampa Bay has a tendency to struggle against division opponents. While I can&rsquo;t say for sure why, it may be related to the fact that division opponents have more inside information about Jameis Winston and his sloppy tendencies. Carolina shellacking the Buccaneers in their second go-around is evidence of this, though it&rsquo;s worth noting that game took place in London.</p>

<p>Regardless, I expect those same struggles to surface again here against a capable Saints defense, even if it&rsquo;s missing the services of its best defensive back in Marshon Lattimore.</p>

<p>The only thing that concerns me is Drew Brees&rsquo; unwillingness to throw deep against this season. It seems age caught up to him. Either way, he&rsquo;ll need to throw deep against a secondary riddled with weak points all over should New Orleans want to win comfortably.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="falcons-panthers-5-5"><em>Falcons</em> @ Panthers (-5.5)</h4>

<p>Does Kyle Allen really deserve to be a 5.5 point favorite against anybody in this league aside from the Bengals? Maybe he&rsquo;ll prove me wrong Sunday, but I doubt it. He still has his issues, though he does tend to play better at home.</p>

<p>But this Panthers defense has been suspect for some time now and I expect the Falcons to put up points so long as Julio Jones can shed James Bradberry off him and Calvin Ridley can step up now that Austin Hooper will be out indefinitely. It also helps that Atlanta is so much better against their division rivals than against other teams - Quinn&rsquo;s approach of spending more time in practice focusing on their division cohorts has paid off here.</p>

<p>Besides, Dan Quinn&rsquo;s recent hands-on approach with the coaching of the defensive line has already yielded promising results against the Saints last week. Even if the Falcons pass rushers don&rsquo;t enjoy the same success they saw in Louisiana last week, it shouldn&rsquo;t take as much pressure to rattle an unseasoned quarterback like Kyle Allen.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="texans-ravens-4">Texans @ <em>Ravens</em> (-4)</h4>

<p>I shied away from this match initially as both teams are too good for me to have any confidence betting one side. But upon further examination, the Ravens have the better head coach, the better set of pass rushers, the home field advantage, and the better overall energy. Generally put, Baltimore is the better team here.</p>

<p>That being said, it does worry me a bit that the Texans are coming into this game with the comeback kid at quarterback and his full complement of receivers. Deshaun Watson has been damn near phenomenal in his short career so far whenever he mounts comebacks. And he could do the same here against a Ravens team trying to salt this game away late in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>Still, Baltimore had experience this season defending against a sensational quarterback in Russell Wilson. That game ended up being Seattle&rsquo;s worst showing this year, as the Seahawks lost control of the game in the fourth quarter. The Ravens coasted to a victory in that match. Maybe the same happens here&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="cardinals-49ers-11">Cardinals @ <em>49ers</em> (-11)</h4>

<p>Give me the elite defense here hurting off a bad loss and playing against a rookie quarterback limited by a playbook built mostly around quick passes and misdirection plays. If the 49ers force the Cardinals to play classical dropback football here, things won&rsquo;t end well for Arizona.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="chiefs-vs-chargers-3-5">Chiefs vs <em>Chargers</em> (+3.5)</h4>

<p>Always a risk to pick against a good team in Kansas City, but the Chiefs are not stout at all on defense. The offense will need to outgun opponents to win decisive matches, but the Chargers are difficult to outgun given their talent on offense, starting with quarterback Philip Rivers.</p>

<p>Besides, I do respect Anthony Lynn&rsquo;s attempts to prep his team to play this game in the high altitudes of Mexico City. Unlike Andy Reid, who seems content letting his team practice as if this were any other game, Anthony Lynn is forcing his team to practice in the heights of Colorado Springs in order to condition them for the hypoxemia that&rsquo;ll hit them as the game wears on.</p>

<p>On top of that, the Chargers taking more than three points makes them all the more tempting.</p>

			<h2 id="bills-browns">Bills @ Browns</h2>

<p>Finally, Baker is re-establishing a rapport with Jarvis Landry.</p>

<p>Three downs to move the ball one yard in order to keep the chains moving. Kitchens opts for three straight passing plays, despite having one of the best halfbacks in the game. Only on the fourth down do you try play action. Amazing.</p>

<p>Cleveland&rsquo;s offensive line cannot play power football. Six rushes roughly three or less yards away from the goal line and the Browns were hopeless on just about every single run, especially against a team that has not been so stout against the rush.</p>

<p>Bills are dangerous with their designed quarterback runs. Two big runs on one drive led to a touchdown.</p>

<p>The Browns&rsquo; goal-to-go play package may have been deciphered by this Bills defense. Cleveland is just absolutely hopeless when just a few yards away from the goal line.</p>

<p>Baker Mayfield is overrated. Not only that, but this Cleveland has screwed up now on two forward pitches, something science initially deemed impossible. I&rsquo;m never betting on this Browns team again.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="giants-jets">Giants @ Jets</h2>

<p>Jets using zone blitzes to try and confuse Daniel Jones. We&rsquo;ll see whether Jones can weather Gregg Williams&rsquo; trickery.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-steelers">Rams @ Steelers</h2>

<p>The Steelers seem to like to spread their linebackers out towards the edge of the tackle box, leaving the defense more vulnerable to runs up the middle.</p>

<p>The Rams defense is intent on having the Steelers play from negative game script. Apparently, Los Angeles is convinced Mason Rudolph and the offense struggle to recover from negative plays.</p>

<p>Mason Rudolph himself has acknowledged his own inability to throw the deep pass. So far though, it seems the man is making more of an effort to generate more air yards, committing himself more to throwing intermediate routes.</p>

<p>McVay&rsquo;s self-scouting is to be taken with a grain of salt. His unwillingness to really change his system up much during the offseason is testament enough that the Rams lack the willpower to truly change and remain ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>Clay Matthews stepping up as the complimentary pass rusher to Aaron Donald.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-cowboys">Vikings @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>Cowboys relying on dropback passing to matriculate the ball instead of play-action and runs.</p>

<p>Screens are eviscerating this Cowboys defense. The Vikings are taking advantage of this overzealous Cowboys defensive front.</p>

<p>Mike Hughes staking his name as the best cornerback on this Vikings secondary.</p>

<p>Worth noting that slight pressure from Michael Bennett threw Cousins off on a big play.</p>

<p>Harrison Smith is the featured blitz defender for the Vikings.</p>

<p>Vikings are committed to their plan of stopping Zeke first and foremost. By large, the Cowboys&rsquo; success on offense has come courtesy of Dak Prescott. Let&rsquo;s see if the Cowboys smarten up and counter through carefully executed play-action concepts.</p>

<p>Poor decision by Kirk Cousins on a free play. Worrisome.</p>

<p>Amari Cooper with his toe-tap receptions is damn near magical.</p>

<p>The Vikings deciphered the Cowboys and their running game. Zeke was neutered here. Other coaches should be looking at this game as a template on how to stop the Cowboys from rushing the ball at will.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="seahawks-49ers">Seahawks @ 49ers</h2>

<p>Seahawks coming out strong with the press coverage.</p>

<p>Jadaveon Clowney stepping up and not falling for any of the trickery of the 49ers offense.</p>

<p>49ers making money off slants against Seattle&rsquo;s man coverage.</p>

<p>Jimmy Garoffalo is sailing his passes tonight. His errant passing is throwing this game for the 49ers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-buccaneers">Cardinals @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>The Cardinals have been wowing me with initial set of misdirection plays on their first drive.</p>

<p>But then in the red zone, things quickly fall apart. For some reason, Arizona lacks imagination when it comes to red zone plays. Their season red zone scoring percentage seems to be a testament to this.</p>

<p>The Cardinals are winning the battle in the trenches against the Buccaneers offense. Tampa Bay is struggling to run the ball and pass protect against Arizona&rsquo;s pass rushers.</p>

<p>Still, Tampa Bay was able to work the ball down into the end zone through fortunate penalties, a fantastic catch by Mike Evans, and the Cardinals simply being inept in their prevent defense.</p>

<p>Kliff Kingsbury seems to be scheming things so that Kyler Murray gets rid of the ball quickly.</p>

<p>Arizona&rsquo;s offensive line failed in their run-blocking and pass protection discipline on a sequence of four plays, killing a promising drive.</p>

<p>On a late-game drive, Tampa Bay only saw success on a scramble from Jameis on a 3rd-and-long situation and two chain-moving throws to receivers NOT named Mike Evans.</p>

<p>Arizona with the wicked fake punt to keep the drive alive.</p>

<p>Kyler Murray is being given options on these plays. On one play, the rookie opted out of a wide receiver screen to throw a deep out route to Larry Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay&rsquo;s run defense is stout, thanks in no small part to players like Vita Vea and Jason Pierre-Paul.</p>

<p>Godwin turning into the Bucs&rsquo; de facto second receiver.</p>

<p>Arizona&rsquo;s conditioning towards the end of the game is a cause for concern. Missed tackles and sloppy form.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="panthers-packers">Panthers @ Packers</h2>

<p>Carolina initiating things with a run-heavy drive.</p>

<p>Packers moving the ball down on the Panthers with a couple touch throws from Rodgers. His pass protection has held up remarkably.</p>

<p>Kyle Allen can be mobile.</p>

<p>Green Bay&rsquo;s receivers seem to have trouble gaining separation from defensive backs.</p>

<p>Two sideline throws to Davante Adams have been key to getting the Packers in position for touchdowns.</p>

<p>The Panthers&rsquo; left tackle is a liability in protection. He was largely the reason a promising drive ended prematurely.</p>

<p>Luke Kuechly has been strangely off in his defense against the run. His decisions are flatly wrong. On one drive, the Panthers gave up a little over 40 yards rushing en route to a Packers touchdown. Part of the reason why is the linebackers not executing on their responsibilities to guard against the run.</p>

			<h5 id="cardinals-buccaneers-4-5"><em>Cardinals</em> @ Buccaneers (-4.5)</h5>

<p>A little wary of this pick, as Tampa Bay tends to play better against non-division opponents. And really, the Buccaneers should have covered last week against Seattle, which means this spread should be a touch higher.</p>

<p>Still&hellip;Arizona has been remarkably competent over the past couple weeks. Kliff Kingsbury&rsquo;s willingness to tweak his air raid philosophy over the past few weeks and incorporate more rushing plays into the offensive playbook has paid off in spades. Kyler Murray and this Cardinals team have found their rhythm and played well, even putting up an admirable performance against the league&rsquo;s best defense last week. I expect the good times to keep on going, especially if Patrick Peterson and Buddha Baker are out there in the secondary picking off some of Jameis Winston&rsquo;s errant throws.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="falcons-saints-13">Falcons @ <em>Saints</em> (-13)</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of taking the Saints as double-digit favorites, as the team has a habit of taking games off every now and then. But against a hated division rival, I do expect New Orleans to play hard here, especially if the potential is there to run up points against a Falcons defense made out of cardboard cut-outs.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="lions-bears-2-5">Lions @ <em>Bears</em> (-2.5)</h5>

<p>The Bears are just awful. Simply awful. But this Lions team isn&rsquo;t really much better, even though Stafford&rsquo;s commitment to deeper throws has made this offense look better. It&rsquo;s the milquetoast defense that&rsquo;s the problem - the Lions are awful at generating pressure with their front four linemen and pretty predictable with their man coverage schemes. If Nagy can scheme up enough plays to expose Detroit&rsquo;s predictability on defense, Chicago can scrape by here with a win.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="dolphins-colts-10">Dolphins @ <em>Colts</em> (-10)</h5>

<p>Even though Indianapolis has yet to win a game by more than 7 points this season, it seems this would be the perfect game to run away with the points. Unlike the careful Jacoby Brissett, Brian Hoyer is more willing to take chances and fling those home run balls. Those opportunities will be there against one of the league&rsquo;s worst pass defenses, especially if T.Y. Hilton is healthy.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="rams-steelers-3-5">Rams @ <em>Steelers</em> (+3.5)</h5>

<p>It seems a little odd to me that the Rams would be significant road favorites against a decent Steelers team. Yes, Pittsburgh&rsquo;s offense isn&rsquo;t quite the same with Mason Rudolph at its helm&hellip;but then again, has the Rams offense been the same since the Super Bowl last season? I think people here are too quickly falling back in love with McVay after his team posted back-to-back wins against bottom-tier teams.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that the Rams offensive line still presents a liability here, one that can be exploited by one of the league&rsquo;s better pass-rushing units.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="bills-browns-3">Bills @ <em>Browns</em> (-3)</h5>

<p>The Bills ridiculously poor run defense will not serve them well here against Nick Chubb. Now if Cleveland can stop shooting themselves in the foot&hellip;</p>

			<h2 id="texans-jaguars-london">Texans @ Jaguars (London)</h2>

<p>Leonard Fournette being a power runner doesn&rsquo;t bode well for a Jaguars team playing from behind.</p>

<p>Remind me to never side with a rookie quarterback in his second outing against a division opponent. The Texans are not getting any pressure on Minshew, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter as Houston seems to have gotten a beat on the Jaguars passing tendencies. The Texans&rsquo; coverage schemes are taking away many of the offensive concepts Minshew has gotten comfortable executing. Without those easy throws, Minshew is left spooked.</p>

<p>Then again, it also hurts that Minshew is lacking a playmaker in Dede Westbrook today.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="colts-steelers">Colts @ Steelers</h2>

<p>Jabaal Sheard may be the Colts&rsquo; best defensive linemen. Making stops against the run and against 4th down trick plays too.</p>

<p>The Colts offensive line is incredibly dominant. The Steelers pass rush is nearly nonexistent. Brian Hoyer is being given too much time to pick apart the Steelers zone defense.</p>

<p>Zone defense is too risky when you don&rsquo;t have the horses to execute that style of defense. And the Colts matriculating the ball downfield with ease tells me that the Steelers don&rsquo;t have those horses.</p>

<p>The Colts defense played so well on the last drive, forcing the Steelers into short passes that essentially drained clock. Had it not been for an overzealous Darius Leonard, the Steelers would have done nothing on that last drive. Frank reich and Matt Eburfleus have this team excellently coached.</p>

<p>Calling more blitzes in the second half will be the key difference for the Steelers should they pull out the win here. Still, their offensive play-calling is not helping matters either today. Randy Fichtner picks the wrong times to be conservative. Not to mention some of his play-calls have been less than inspiring.</p>

<p>This Steelers team is so frustrating. It&rsquo;s no wonder why Pittsburgh has only won against losing teams and have yet to claim victory against winning teams before today. It seems Pittsburgh is a team trying to show itself to be more talented than they actually are.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="buccaneers-seahawks">Buccaneers @ Seahawks</h2>

<p>Not much of a surprise, but Jameis genuinely plays better against teams not as familiar with him.</p>

<p>It also helps that the Seahawks are unable to generate any pressure with their pass rushing specialists alone. Having to resort to the blitz leaves passing lanes open that Jameis can exploit more often than not.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Seahawks decide to throw some big passes on a drive that could have been a closing drive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="browns-broncos">Browns @ Broncos</h2>

<p>Broncos are mercilessly killing this Browns defense on one drive using heavy play action on multiple first downs.</p>

<p>Browns tackling is absolutely sloppy. Why did I take this team again as road favorites? Never take bad teams on the road, especially when they&rsquo;re giving points to the other side.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-chiefs">Vikings @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Tyreek Hill&rsquo;s ability to beat bracket coverage is really something. Kudos to Matt Moore for throwing a good pass.</p>

<p>Cousins is not as effective as he was the last three weeks.</p>

<p>The Chiefs have done an excellent job bottling up the run so far in the first quarter. In fact, something tells me the defense has gotten a beat on the way the Vikings run the football.</p>

<p>Solid defensive play-calling to kill a Chiefs drive late in the game. Sending more men over the weak side of the line ended up putting a good bit more pressure on Matt Moore.</p>

<p>The Vikings defense has hit home a few times when it comes to pressuring the passer, but Matt Moore threw two key balls over to Tyreek Hill on a drive that ended in a critical field goal. Tyreek Hill is a game-changer.</p>

<p>The Chiefs defensive tackles are consistently winning their battles against the interior of the Vikings offensive line.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-panthers">Titans @ Panthers</h2>

<p>Panthers are horrid at defending against the run.</p>

<p>The interior of the Titans offensive line may be a point of weakness.</p>

<p>Solid coverage by the Panthers defensive backs.</p>

<p>Tennessee&rsquo;s defense on the other hand leaves much to be desired. Being gifted a few interceptions by Jameis Winston last week seems to have left them overconfident. The only good thing the defense is doing is getting pressure on the quarterback. Yet that pressure means little if you let the Panthers convert on downs like 3rd and 14. The worst part is that Carolina moved the chains on that down with a wide receiver screen that was only designed to net several yards and set up an easier field goal.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="lions-raiders">Lions @ Raiders</h2>

<p>So far on this Lions first drive, Detroit is cutting through this Oakland defense like swiss cheese.</p>

<p>But a bungled handoff from Stafford to McKissic leads to a lost fumble, killing that drive.</p>

<p>Josh Jacobs is something special. Up there with Dalvin Cook and Alvin Kamara in terms of shiftiness and agility.</p>

<p>Daryl Worley is a major point of weakness in the Oakland defensive backfield.</p>

<p>Derek Carr playing smart, making quick decisions even in weird situations.</p>

<p>Lazy coverage, sloppy zone execution from linebackers&hellip;Oakland&rsquo;s pass defense is a mess.</p>

<p>No punts in the first quarter and a half. Says something about the relative quality of the offenses against these defenses.</p>

<p>Trey Flowers coming up big on two consecutive plays, effectively killing an Oakland drive.</p>

<p>Johnathan Hankins making a difference against the run in particular.</p>

<p>The Raiders defense seems to have adjusted in the second half by blitzing more. Seems to be working out so far&hellip;</p>

<p>Carr bailed out of the pocket too early on 3rd down, essentially limiting his options and killing the drive.</p>

			<h5 id="texans-jaguars-1">Texans @ <em>Jaguars</em> (+1)</h5>

<p>I have faith in Gardner Minshew and the Jaguars offense finding some success here in their second home against a Texans defense missing its best playmaker in J.J. Watt.</p>

<p>I am worried about the Jaguars and their porous coverage schemes here. Their soft zone defense can be picked apart by good quarterbacks. And given Watson&rsquo;s ability to run the ball, that would expose this questionable defense even more. But the defensive line simply needs to step up and mow down this offensive line should they want a definite victory here.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="colts-steelers-1">Colts @ <em>Steelers</em> (+1)</h5>

<p>The Steelers impressed me last week with a solid performance against the Dolphins after coming out of their bye week a little hungover. Mason Rudolph, just weeks removed from a debilitating concussion, was smartly throwing the ball deep against a Miami defense that is simply unable to defend the pass. Had it not been for early game rust, the Steelers would have covered the double-digit spread with ease.</p>

<p>The Colts have gotten by at this point by having built a solid infrastructure around a careful Jacoby Brissett. It&rsquo;s the robustness of their roster that has enabled them to squeak out wins this seasons.  But without T.Y. Hilton, the margin for error has gotten so much more slimmer for this team. And I expect the Colts to make a few mistakes against one of the NFL&rsquo;s better defensive lines playing on their own home turf.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="redskins-bills-9-5">Redskins @ <em>Bills</em> (-9.5)</h5>

<p>Risky here to pick an above-average team to win by more than a touchdown against any NFL team, even on their own home turf.</p>

<p>But the Redskins are starting <em>Dwayne Haskins</em> here. In his 22 pass attempts this year, Haskins has thrown 4 interceptions. As if that stat alone isn&rsquo;t enough of a testament to his hopelessness, his reported disillusionment with the team and his feelings of entitlement to the starter position just paints a worse picture of him.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="browns-broncos-3"><em>Browns</em> @ Broncos (+3)</h5>

<p>Tough to side with the Browns here, but I have to admit that Cleveland impressed me last week with a decent showing against the Patriots. Nick Chubb took his game to a new level and the pass rushing specialists finally stepped up as a unit, even if it was against a weakened Patriots offensive line featuring Marshall Newhouse.</p>

<p>But the Broncos aren&rsquo;t much better so long as Garrett Bowles still remains a starting tackle along their offensive line. I expect the Browns to break through and once again pressure a journeyman quarterback starting in his first game as a Bronco without ever having taken a meaningful snap before with the team.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="buccaneers-seahawks-6"><em>Buccaneers</em> @ Seahawks (-6)</h5>

<p>I love this spot for the Buccaneers. Tampa Bay has been all over the place this year, but their better performances this year has come against non-division opponents. Cue a Seahawks team that seems to play worse at home than on the road. It also helps that Seattle&rsquo;s defense has choked up yardage over the season - neither Ezekiel Ansah nor Jadaveon Clowney have really panned out as marquis pass rushers. Without a pass rush, the young secondary has been hung out to dry on a number of occasions.</p>

			<h2 id="giants-lions">Giants @ Lions</h2>

<p>Why does Pat Shurmur run on 2nd and long? Why is this a thing in the NFL?</p>

<p>Giants run defense once again choking up yardage to opposing rushers.</p>

<p>Jones is rough. The kid is still holding on to balls recklessly. And Shurmur telegraphing run plays doesn&rsquo;t help the situation.</p>

<p>Giants offensive playbook seems to favor high-low routes where a receiver runs a slant route to the outside while the inside receiver crosses underneath to the flat. Daniel Jones seems to prefer throwing to the deeper receiver, even in tight coverage.</p>

<p>Darius Slayton may be a beast in the making for the Giants. Finally, somebody worthy of taking that Hakeem Nicks role.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="eagles-bills">Eagles @ Bills</h2>

<p>Josh Allen&rsquo;s ability to run is really tasking these coverage defenders patrolling the flat. The threat of Josh Allen scrambling has these defenders dropping off their assignments.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="browns-patriots">Browns @ Patriots</h2>

<p>Greedy Williams and Denzel Ward playing well in their return.</p>

<p>Once again, the Browns shooting themselves in the foot with penalties.</p>

<p>New England&rsquo;s passing offense is definitely suspect. It seems the team only found consistent success through their screen game and improvisational plays. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the defense, the game would have been competitive well into the fourth quarter.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-chiefs">Packers @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>More blitzing by the Chiefs linebackers and safeties leading to positive results.</p>

<p>Lots of window dressing before the snap serving the Chiefs well, confusing this Packers defense. It also helps that the Packers are regularly overcompensating in their coverage on Tyreek Hill.</p>

<p>The Chiefs&rsquo; linebackers are liabilities in coverage, particularly in 5-wide situations.</p>

<p>The creative plays that were sustaining the Chiefs early in the game have largely disappeared. Reid only drew up so many of them, apparently. Late game magic for the Chiefs largely boils down to the quarterback&rsquo;s ability to create plays.</p>

<p>Rodgers has taken over the offensive play-calling in closing out the game, which indicates to me that LaFleur is reluctantly (but correctly) allowing his quarterback to call the shots when need be.</p>

<h2 id="chargers-bears">Chargers @ Bears</h2>

<p>Soldier Field has some slippery turf. Good coaches like Sean Payton are well aware of this and advise their players to wear better cleats. Bad coaches like Anthony Lynn aren&rsquo;t quite as sharp though.</p>

<p>Interesting coverage defense by the Bears on a third down. Showed blitz, only for defenders to back out away from the line of scrimmage leaving only three people to rush the passer. These defenders backing off took away the crossing routes two of the Chargers skill players were running.</p>

<p>Joey Bosa making key plays in the first quarter alone.</p>

<p>Chargers defense on long third downs is just abysmal.</p>

<p>Chicago&rsquo;s offensive line is showing some serious symptoms of incompetency.</p>

<p>The Chargers offensive line is just as bad.</p>

<p>Kudos to Trubisky for completing a few big plays, but the Bears red zone offense is truly pathetic. It seems Nagy doesn&rsquo;t full trust his quarterback in goal-to-go situations either. Not to mention it doesn&rsquo;t help that Mitch no longer runs around like he used to.</p>

<p>To the Bears credit, their offense found themselves in the red zone on five different occasions in the first half. And yet, not a single touchdown was scored. Sure, Trubisky could be to blame for the offense&rsquo;s ineptitude for the red zone, but I&rsquo;m also seeing Matt Nagy&rsquo;s gimmick plays and goal-to-go plays fail to move the ball past the goal line. This Bears offense is hopeless if it needs to rely on Trubisky dropping back to pass, which seems more and more to be the case as teams have gotten a beat on the exotic plays the Bears like to run.</p>

<p>The Bears finally strung together a quality touchdown drive, mainly by calling 6 straight runs and then using some drive momentum on a deep throw to Allen Robinson. Chargers seem to have issues bottling up the run.</p>

<p>Bears like their zone coverage in this game. Fine by Rivers, he&rsquo;s not having many problems here. So long as the Chargers hold up in pass protection, Rivers can operate here.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jets-jaguars">Jets @ Jaguars</h2>

<p>Jacksonville roasted the Jets with an inside run against an 8-man box. Not a good sign for New York.</p>

<p>Jaguars soft zone defense not doing much of anything.</p>

<p>Jets smartly using quick plays on offense to matriculate the ball downfield.</p>

<p>Minshew working his magic and delivering a perfect ball on a scramble away from pressure.</p>

<p>The Jets left tackle is a liability.</p>

<p>Jets cornerbacks are affording receivers too much space on blitz situations.</p>

<p>Minshew doing well reading Gregg Williams&rsquo; blitz schemes.</p>

<p>Ever since giving up a big run to Fournette on that early run, the Jets run defense has been stout.</p>

<p>The entire Jets offensive line is a major liability in pass protection. Only the right tackle seems somewhat qualified to be playing in the professional league here.</p>

<p>Two fumbles by the Jaguars on special teams. Sloppy.</p>

<p>Jets blitz pick-up is still lame. But Gase is starting to adjust late in the game by calling quick passes and occasional gadget plays to keep the heat off Darnold.</p>

<p>Deceptive blitz by the Jaguars forced a bad throw from Darnold on a short field.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="dolphins-steelers">Dolphins @ Steelers</h2>

<p>Miami willing to gamble. The defense tried a jailbreak blitz on a 3rd-and-20 in order to push the Steelers out of field goal range. Instead, Mason Rudolph was able to hit a short crosser for a long-developing 45-yard touchdown.</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick a major gambler, even under pressure. No surprise.</p>

<p>Rudolph developing a taste for Juju Smith-Schuster.</p>

<p>Miami&rsquo;s defensive backs are liabilities in coverage. Pair that with one of the weaker defensive lines in the league and you have a pretty shitty defense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="buccaneers-titans">Buccaneers @ Titans</h2>

<p>On the first drive, the Buccaneers could have scored. But two bad decisions by Winston killed any chance at a touchdown. The first bad decision came when he tried to force a throw to Mike Evans under heavy coverage. The second bad decision was not diagnosing man-to-man coverage before the snap and throwing to his tight end crossing over the formation from behind the line of scrimmage.</p>

<p>Jameis messing up a snap ends up giving the Titans a goal-to-go touchdown.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay loves running between their tackles on zone schemes.</p>

<p>Ryan Tannehill isn&rsquo;t immune to bad quarterback play either. Some of his first quarter decisions have already been questionable. Not to mention his anticipation needs to be called into question.</p>

<p>In part due to a tip, Winston throws another interception that gifts the Titans with yet another goal-to-go touchdown.</p>

<p>Why do the Titans have fade routes in their red zone package?</p>

<p>Jameis under pressure has been unusually good.</p>

			<h2 id="cardinals-giants">Cardinals @ Giants</h2>

<p>Chase Edmonds is a beast at halfback. Good vision and acceleration.</p>

<p>Cardinals are actually incorporating a good number of run plays into their offensive playbooks. Some balance is being maintained here, which is telling. It honestly seems Kingsbury&rsquo;s Air Raid experiment may have come to an end here. Even though no team runs more 10 personnel sets than the Cardinals, the fact that Arizona is willfully running the ball on a regular basis violates one of the core tenets of the Air Raid philosophy.</p>

<p>Defensive line for the Cardinals had their moment here. Eight sacks and multiple quarterback hits, mostly thanks to Daniel Jones insisting on holding the ball longer than he should, even on plays that are not developing as intended.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-bears">Saints @ Bears</h2>

<p>Mitchell Trubisky throwing deep is a strategy primed for failure. Trubisky needs to be taught to play smarter and take yardage whenever it avails itself.</p>

<p>What am I saying? MVP Mitch is irredeemable.</p>

<p>Teddy Bridgewater throwing the ball away when plays don&rsquo;t develop as expected. Not ideal, but more quarterbacks need to be doing this instead of playing hero ball.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-colts">Texans @ Colts</h2>

<p>Penalties, penalties, penalties&hellip;.the Texans have been victimized on multiple drives by penalties.</p>

<p>Jacoby Brissett made one clutch throw under duress and almost completed a second one under major pressure from JJ Watt.</p>

<p>The Texans&rsquo; backup right tackle is simply horrendous. Pressure on a three-man rush is a major red flag.</p>

<p>The Colts defense looks to be pretty disciplined here, given the way a defensive lineman disrupted a tight end from running a leak route out of play action.</p>

<p>Pierre Desir is definitely a solid cornerback for the Colts here, holding DeAndre Hopkins to limited receptions in key moments.</p>

<p>Nobody on this Texans team hit the quarterback more than once outside of JJ Watt. It&rsquo;s concerning, especially for a team that&rsquo;s not that solidly coached in the first place. If this game made one thing clear, it&rsquo;s that Watt is the only elite pass rusher on this squad as of this week.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-lions">Vikings @ Lions</h2>

<p>Dalvin Cook is one slippery fuck. And the Vikings knows it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="dolphins-bills">Dolphins @ Bills</h2>

<p>Slow linebacker coverage from the Dolphins resulted in a big play from a Bills fullback - Patrick DiMarco.</p>

<p>Josh Allen&rsquo;s deep throws are fueled more by prayer than accuracy. Ryan Fitzpatrick has thrown a dime though early, slinging a ball to a receiver in between a cornerback and safety.</p>

<p>Dolphins play a decent amount of man coverage.</p>

<p>Miami&rsquo;s strength on offense seems to be the inside run game, according to their offensive coordinator. Not so coincidentally, the Dolphins have two big runs up the middle in the first quarter alone.</p>

<p>Bad decision-making by Josh Allen costs his team potentially 4 extra points. Still, Allen did put his team in position for the field goal by taking advantage of the Dolphins&rsquo; poor coverage discipline on a critical third down.</p>

<p>Dolphins seem adamant on running the ball even against eight-man boxes.</p>

<p>Another fantastic dime pass from Fitzpatrick into triple coverage.</p>

<p>Ryan Lewis may be a point of weakness in Miami&rsquo;s secondary.</p>

<p>Miami&rsquo;s play-action fakes tend to lead to throws outside the numbers, interestingly enough.</p>

<p>Edward Oliver a big player on this Bills defensive line, especially against the run.</p>

<p>Tre&rsquo;Davious White is something special, both in pass coverage and against the rush.</p>
