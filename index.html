			<h5 id="packers-5-patriots"><em>Packers (+5)</em> @ Patriots</h5>

<p>Listen, it&rsquo;s always risky betting against the Patriots, but their defense is a little too tepid for my liking. The Packers will cover so long as Bill Belichick&rsquo;s defense fail to keep Aaron Rodger&rsquo;s receivers bottled up under man coverage. As I keep saying, the Packers can be routed so long as you have a defensive secondary that can perform reasonably well in man-to-man defense. If you don&rsquo;t have such a secondary, expect Rodgers to run up some scores on you.</p>

<p>That being said, the only truly solid corner the Patriots are fielding is Stephon Gilmore, which would normally be a cause for concern if New England was coached by anybody but Bill Belichick. But the Darth has a way of bringing out better performances from his defensive personnel on certain weeks. Now would be the week for his defensive backs to step up and make Aaron Rodgers hold the ball long enough so that Trey Flowers to hit home.</p>

<p>Now even if the Packers see some of their drives stall through the game, Green Bay can still cover the spread. The Packers boast a quality pass rush that can throw Brady off on some of his drives. So I like Green Bay quite a bit here.</p>

<p>Of course, whenever I end up liking a side a <em>little too much,</em> the betting gods find a way to fuck me. So beware here&hellip;</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 9 - Best Bets</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>My best bets of the week. Last week, I went 2-3. Two of those three losses came courtesy of the Chiefs and Rams failing to cover their spreads. BAH! I would not consider either of those picks to be terrible&hellip;but it is pretty clear neither team deserved to cover their respective spreads last week. And this week, I will be rooting against one of them to flat out lose.</p>

<p>Here are five of my six picks.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="lions-vikings-4-5">Lions @ <em>Vikings (-4.5)</em></h5>

<p>Rivers McCown of Football Outsiders did an <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/any-given-sunday/2018/any-given-sunday-seahawks-over-lions">excellent piece</a> on the Seahawks-Lions game last week. As part of his research, he looked into the Lions rushing attack this season and drew up a chart showing a peculiarity about the consequences of their run game.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Screen Shot 2018-11-02 at 11.58.08 PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>DVOA ratings are the proprietary metrics that Football Outsiders developed to grade teams on any facet of their game. Basically, if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with DVOA, just know that in the particular case of this chart, a higher DVOA means a better performance from the offense.</p>

<p>The Lions rushing attack only graded out positively two weeks this season. And those two weeks brought out the absolute best in their offense as well. And when their rush game isn&rsquo;t quite on point? Their offense suffers dearly.</p>

<p>I expect their offense to stall against a Vikings defense that&rsquo;s one of the best at limiting yards per carry. Sure, Minnesota may end up missing the services of Stefon Diggs in this game, but I trust Mike Zimmer will have other people step up in his stead and contribute effectively enough. And on top of that, I do expect the Lions offense to regress a little now that Stafford will have to live life without Golden Taint.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="chiefs-browns-under-52">Chiefs @ Browns <em>(Under 52)</em></h5>

<p>Holy hell. I love this pick. I absolutely do.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes when I saw such a high total. Although I suppose I understand why the sportsbook set the total past 50&hellip;we have a Chiefs team that can seemingly score at will.</p>

<p>But the Browns just promoted their defensive coordinator to interim head coach earlier in the week, right as the AFC&rsquo;s top team comes to town. The situational context may be enough for the Browns defense to keep the Chiefs at bay for much of this game.</p>

<p>Likewise, I expect the Browns offense to stall as well, as Baker Mayfield will likely be harangued by the Chiefs potent pass rush. And even if the Browns offensive line manage to win in pass protection for much of the game&hellip;will the offense even be serviceable under the stifling thumb of Gregg Williams?</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="steelers-3-ravens"><em>Steelers (+3)</em> @ Ravens</h5>

<p>Bah. Going with the Steelers here, as two major analytics outfits (Pro Football Focus and Football Outsiders) have both flagged the Steelers as a hot pick this week.</p>

<p>It does make sense though. A divisional rematch against a hated rival tends to favor the loser of the first match, especially if that loser is taking points in the second match. On top of that, the Steelers have shown some promise over their last couple games, particularly in their ground game. The Ravens, on the other hand, have shown us reason to doubt them in their game last week against the Panthers.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="buccaneers-6-panthers"><em>Buccaneers (+6)</em> @ Panthers</h5>

<p>Give me the Bucs all day here. Yes, the Panthers proved that they were a damn good team in their win last week against the Ravens, but it seems to me that win was buoyed in part by a flaccid performance from Flacco and an emotionally-fueled performance from their offensive and defensive lines. If you believe in let-down spots, this is a solid let-down spot, what with the Panthers playing at home against a bottom-feeder going through some turmoil at the quarterback position.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Screen Shot 2018-11-04 at 12.07.51 PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To be fair, my ELO model above has actually booked this game in favor of the Panthers by 8 points. And I understand why - the Panthers have been consistently winning against solid competition whereas the Buccaneers have been flailing for the past several weeks. But the Buccaneers offense have proven they can scrounge up points, regardless of whether Jameis Winston or Ryan Fitzpatrick sits at its helm. And I do expect them to round up scores against a Panthers defensive secondary that can be picked upon.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="rams-saints-1-5">Rams @ <em>Saints (-1.5)</em></h5>

<p>The Rams frustrated me last week, mostly because I had quite a bit of money on them. They were lucky to escape their own coliseum with a win after Ty Montgomery decided to go rogue and run the ball out of the end-zone on a kickoff.</p>

<p>What last week showed me is that the Rams lack quality defensive personnel, particularly in the backfield. Wade Phillips knows damn well how to stop Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay offense - blanket their receivers in man coverage and count on Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh to wreak havoc on the frontlines. He successfully implemented a similar game plan against Green Bay as defensive coordinator of the Broncos during their Super Bowl year.</p>

<p>But the Packers receivers were running buck wild around the field because the defensive backs were simply unable to compete. And if those defensive backs are unable to hang with an average set of receivers, Drew Brees and Michael Thomas should have their way against the secondary, especially if those linebackers focus wholly on Alvin Kamara.</p>

<hr />

<p>The sixth pick will be revealed later tonight&hellip;.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 8 Review</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>My Supercontest picks sucked this week.</p>

<p>Not really too interested in dwelling too much on why my selections didn&rsquo;t pan out, although I do want to give a bit of a breakdown of the Kansas City/Denver game.</p>

<p>As I expected, Kansas City would post at least 30 points. But what took me by surprise was Case Keenum. Arrowhead Stadium is usually the place where bad quarterbacks go to finally die. Just look at Blake Bortles and his downfall following his poor showing in Arrowhead earlier in the season.</p>

<p>But Keenum held his own, bolstering my preseason expectation that the man would actually be serviceable as a starting quarterback for the Broncos.</p>

<p>Three big plays drove Denver towards the cover here. All of them are pass plays. Watch the GIFs below:</p>

            height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>These plays only serve to remind me that despite their success last week against the Bengals, the Chiefs still have one of the worst pass defenses in this league. It won&rsquo;t really change either, as the the whole defense shares the blames for their coverage woes. Just look at the plays above -</p>

<ul>
<li>The first big pass play came largely as a result of a gamble by edge rusher Dee Ford to crash down on the inside of the pocket, which allowed Keenum to run to his right and extend the play some more.</li>
<li>The second big pass play came because cornerback Steven Nelson was simply unable to match up physically against receiver Courtland Sutton.</li>
<li>The third big pass play came because the Chiefs secondary completely blew assignments and left one receiver wide open in the end zone.</li>
</ul>

<p>And now the Chiefs are heading to Ohio to play the Browns, a team that I think is now galvanized after <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/sites/csnma/files/styles/article_hero_image/public/2018/10/29/jackson-haley-apusat.png?itok=yZ8LX9uw">Dumb &amp; Dumber</a> were canned yesterday. Baker Mayfield has been playing well, despite his skill players constantly disappointing him. But the firings of their head coach and offensive coordinator may be the kick in the ass his receivers finally need to shape up and play well next Sunday.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 8 - Early Thoughts</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Time to give out some quick thoughts on the slate of games for the eighth week of the regular season&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="philadelphia-eagles-london-jaguars-3">Philadelphia Eagles @ London Jaguars (+3)</h5>

<p>If this was taking place in Philadelphia, I would giddily take the Eagles, even if the spread was inflated up to 6.5 points in their favor.</p>

<p>But London has a sort of rejuvenating effect on these Jaguars and especially on Blake Bortles. And that may be enough to overcome the coaching and quarterbacking deficits the Jaguars face here in this particular match-up.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: None</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="ravens-panthers-2">Ravens @ Panthers (+2)</h5>

<p>Not sure yet. I need to watch the game between the Ravens and the Saints to see how Baltimore&rsquo;s defense game-planned against a legitimate offense. I also need to study up more on Cam Newton&rsquo;s progress as a pocket passer under the tutelage of Norv Turner.</p>

<p>But it is tempting to side with a solid team that&rsquo;s a home underdog.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: Slightly Panthers</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="browns-steelers-8">Browns @ Steelers (-8)</h5>

<p>So tempting to take the Steelers here. The Browns are so awfully coached. Hue Jackson is just horrendous at his job - his criticism of his <strong>own</strong> offense in last week&rsquo;s loss against the Buccaneers was damn near comical.</p>

<p>But the Steelers need to steal away more than a touchdown here to cover the spread, and it is a bit risky laying so many points with a team that&rsquo;s not quite so elite.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: Slightly Steelers</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="broncos-chiefs-10">Broncos @ Chiefs (-10)</h5>

<p>Another tempting favorite here. The Broncos are coached by a dead man walking in Vance Joseph. And playing away from their home field <em>should</em> impact their play considerably, but their recent performance at Arizona seems to say otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: Slightly Chiefs</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="jets-bears-7">Jets @ Bears (-7)</h5>

<p>Way too many points being laid by a team led by Mitch Trubisky. Then again, I&rsquo;m having a hard time siding with a team led by a rookie quarterback that seems to struggle mightily against above-average defenses.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: None</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="redskins-giants-pk">Redskins @ Giants (PK)</h5>

<p>The Giants seem much more concerned about attaching price tags to their players than actually trying to salvage the damn season. At this point, I would say Jay Gruden is the better coach as of now. Likewise, Alex Smith is a better quarterback compared to Eli Manning, a fact that pains the hell out of me to even admit. If a pick is made here, then i think I&rsquo;d have to pick the team with better people at the biggest positions and more upside in general.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: Redskins</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="seahawks-lions-3">Seahawks @ Lions (-3)</h5>

<p>Interesting match-up here. Something about games where both teams are good make you want to bet on them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d lean a little towards the Lions, but my understanding of both teams is limited, to be honest.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: None</strong></p>

<hr />

<h5 id="buccaneers-bengals-4-5">Buccaneers @ Bengals (-4.5)</h5>

<p>Tempted to go with the Bengals, despite their pathetic showing last week in primetime. The Buccaneers cannot be trusted so long as Jameis remains their quarterback. The pass rushers stepped up, even without star Gerald McCoy being on the field - Carl Nassib in particular showed up to play against the team that spurned him in the offseason.</p>

<p>But their emotional showing last week may leave them a little fatigued against a team that will be looking to play better after a humiliating showing last week.</p>

<p><strong>Leaning: Bengals</strong></p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Week 7 - Supercontest Picks</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>And here we are, after a 3-1-1 showing last week in the Supercontest. I actually feel good, even though my odds of landing in the money are pretty damn slim at this point. Still, let&rsquo;s see if we can hit at least 4 wins this week. So with that said, let&rsquo;s proceed with my picks.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="browns-buccaneers-3">Browns @ Buccaneers (-3)</h5>

<p>A little hard for me to put top American dollar on Jameis Winston, but the Buccaneers have too much of an offensive edge over the Browns here, despite the recent emergence of Baker Mayfield as the franchise quarterback the Browns have sought for generations now. Mayfield is still a rookie finding his sea legs, and he hasn&rsquo;t had much help as of late given that his receiving weapons have been letting him down recently. On top of that, the team is managed by the worst coach in the league in Foo Jackson, and I&rsquo;d be shocked if he actually made some serious adjustments to try and rectify his team&rsquo;s offensive woes.</p>

<p>The reality is that the Buccaneers are simply better coached and better able to produce yards compared to the Browns. Now I know, I know&hellip;.that defense. That defense can&rsquo;t stop leaves blowing gently in the wind, let alone professional NFL offenses. But with that being said, the firing of Mike Smith on Monday may be the impetus this defense needs to actually step up and perform well, if only for one week. A decent man lost his job because of their sorry performance, and that cannot sit well with them.</p>

<p>One more thing worth noting&hellip;Jameis Winston showed some maturity after being slammed down roughly by a Falcon defender last week. Instead of stoking hostilities, Winston was actually holding one of his linemen back from starting a violent confrontation. So I do think Jameis may be trending in the right direction this year.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="titans-6-5-chargers-london">Titans (+6.5) @ Chargers (<em>London</em>)</h5>

<p>The Titans were humiliated in wicked fashion last week in their shut-out loss against the Ravens. Nothing illustrates the magnitude of their loss better than the fact that Tennessee gave up 11 sacks while only completing 10 passes. Savage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Chargers are fresh off a dominant win over the Browns. Not only were the Chargers fairly proficient on offense last week, but that defensive line finally found its groove again, racking up nine hits on Baker Mayfield.</p>

<p>That being said&hellip;the Elo model is in love with the Titans here. And I understand why. The Chargers stock is at a season high, whereas the Titans stock is at a season low. If let-down spots are truly a thing in the National Football League, then this may be one such spot for the Chargers. Especially as I have serious doubts about Anthony Lynn&rsquo;s ability to coach his team to succeed consistently. Its during weeks like these when coaching becomes really critical. And the second-year head coach will be challenged to keep his team level-headed as they travel across several time zones to a foreign land full of distracting tourist locales. Add in a Titans team smarting from a ugly loss and don&rsquo;t be surprised to see the Titans be in contention throughout this entire game.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="vikings-3-jets">Vikings (-3) @ Jets</h5>

<p>As I write this, the Vikings are actually sitting as 3.5-point favorites. Initially, I was feeling the Jets in this spot. The Elo model seemed to be siding with New York too, as they were coming off two solid wins. Even though people think of this Minnesota team as a defensive powerhouse, I have always maintained that these Vikings were an overrated bunch. Their embarrassing showing against the <em>Josh Allen-led Bills</em> and then their defense getting routed by the Rams offense&hellip;both of those outcomes were signs that these Vikings were more average than good.</p>

<p>But then when I look at this game from a contrarian perspective&hellip;I realized the Vikings have had their good moments this season as well. Even though that defense was shellacked against Los Angeles three weeks ago, the offense was keeping pace with the Rams&rsquo; electric offense. Then came a statement win against the Eagles, despite Cousins finding himself constantly beset from Philadelphia&rsquo;s pass rush. And after that came an easy win over a team that frankly had no business contending against Minnesota.</p>

<p>What really sells me here on Minnesota is the coaching match-up here. Mike Zimmer has a tendency to frustrate rookie quarterbacks with false looks and last-second movement. Even though Darnold has had a few good weeks now, the fact remains that he&rsquo;s still a rookie quarterback cutting his teeth in the big leagues. Carson Wentz was doing solid as a rookie too, up until the Vikings finally dismantled him. I expect Darnold to suffer the same fate.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="bills-7-5-colts">Bills (+7.5) @ Colts</h5>

<p>This may well be my favorite pick of the week, which is a little unnerving - I try not to rely on bottom-feeders when I place my bets. But the Bills are contending against a scum-tier Colts team that&rsquo;s not performing nearly as well as their final scores may indicate. Despite them falling only eight points short against the Jets, New York easily had wrist control for most of that match, courtesy of several miscues from the Colts&rsquo; offense.</p>

<p>To be frank, those miscues show me that these Colts are a goddamned mess without the sure-handed T.Y. Hilton. Luckily for them, the man is expected to step back into action this week. But Buffalo has the defensive caliber to keep him bottled up for most of the game.</p>

<p>Really, when people pick against the Bills, they do so for their complete lack of offensive prowess. But here&rsquo;s some good news - a fresh face steps in this week to helm the offense. Derek Anderson may only have four career starts over the past five years, but the Bills may benefit from him being a bit of an X-factor. Not much tape is out there on him - the Indianapolis defense will not be entirely too certain what to expect. Yes, I know the Colts run a fairly bland defensive scheme anyway given their lack of truly talented personnel. Still, Indy&rsquo;s defense will have to play more conservatively as they feel out Derek Anderson on his foray back into football&hellip;and that will only help Buffalo here.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="cowboys-2-redskins">Cowboys (+2) @ Redskins</h5>

<p>The Cowboys have finally rejuvenated themselves last Sunday against one of the better defenses in the league. Sure, I may be a bit biased, but the Cowboys were my sleeper pick for the Super Bowl, in part because of the defense&rsquo;s elite potential. The defense has certainly lived up to my high expectations, but the offense has been completely <em>flaccid</em>. And I truly mean flaccid in every sense of the word - watching Dallas try and pass the ball makes me floppy down there. The air game is absolutely pathetic - Cole Beasley is the only true receiver worth his salt on the roster, and the guy is arguably a poor man&rsquo;s Julian Edelman.</p>

<p>It took <a href="https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/7271421184005/2015/1/e58865d5770cc4c54aa514fdd1ccde20/Jason-Garrett-Dallas-Cowboys-nearing-5-year-deal.jpg" title="The Clapper">The Clapper</a> (thank you, Michael Lombardi) a few eons, but the man and offensive coordinator Scott Linehan finally found a way to spark this offense - let Dak run. By letting Dak Prescott run the ball at will, the offense incorporated another dimension to their game plan. Combined with a strong ground game, the offense actually looked somewhat competent last week. Not all of the Cowboys problems were solved (the passing game is still anemic outside of Cole Beasley), but the team has shown considerable progress.</p>

<p>That being said, the Redskins are not a bad team either, though their win last week was rather weak. Even after turning the ball over three times and effectively abandoning their ground game, Carolina fell just several yards short of mounting a successful comeback. Washington&rsquo;s saving grace was its strong start combined with the Panthers lazily stumbling out of the gate coming off a bye. Sure, Jay Gruden deserves some credit for some smart playcalling on Washington&rsquo;s final drive, but I expected a better overall performance from the Redskins coming off an embarrassing primetime defeat. So that being said, I&rsquo;m expecting a bit of a letdown from Washington that will be further exacerbated by the Cowboys and their unrelenting pass rush.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>49ers @ Packers - Quick Analysis</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Here&rsquo;s the story of how I lost a couple units betting on what I thought would be <em>easy money</em>. As degenerate gamblers like myself learn time and time and time again&hellip;the NFL does not provide many opportunities for <em>easy money</em>.</p>

<p>To be fair, it was a solid game, considering people were expecting a slow-developing blowout. Through the first half, the 49ers actually managed to scrounge up a total of 24 points - a complete shocker considering the books had their <strong>final</strong> score set around 17 points. As the second half began, I saw the live line for their total score was actually set at 32.5 points. Three minutes into the third quarter, the total shifted 1 point downward (to 31.5) as the Packers managed to cap a drive with a field goal.</p>

<p>Think about that&hellip;31.5 points? Only 31.5 points?!? The 49ers already posted 24 points on the board. All they needed was a single touchdown and a lousy field goal to soar past that total. The Niners should be able to round up those points easily given the way they were chewing off yardage in the first half. Even if the Packers defense adjusted a little in the second half, the 49ers should still be able to motor along and collect three field goals over 25-ish minutes of playtime. Seemed like a solid bet, so long as the 49ers carried over their fantastic and aggressive playcalling from the first half.</p>

<p><em>Except they didn&rsquo;t.</em></p>

<p>Just look at the table below - it displays the run/pass split for each of San Francisco&rsquo;s 11 drives.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Week 6 - 49ers Drive Analysis.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The problem might not look all too obvious at first, but some additional context is needed. Look at the extended drives - those drives that feature more than five offensive plays. In the first half, the 49ers only sustained two such drives - the 1st and 6th drives. Notice the run/pass splits are fairly even between both drives. In the second half, the 49ers once again managed only two extended drives - the 7th and 8th drives. The 7th drive was another series where runs and passes were evenly called. Now the 8th drive&hellip;.the 8th drive is the reason why the 49ers lost the game.</p>

<p>Notice that the 49ers committed themselves wholly to the run on that 8th drive? CJ Beathard was called upon to throw the ball only twice through that entire series. It seemed like the 49ers were simply content trying to run the ball the rest of the way and escape Green Bay with a victory. Not necessarily a bad strategy when the end of the game is fast approaching and a team is in the lead. But this drive started <em>at the end of the third quarter.</em> Green Bay still had an entire quarter to stage a comeback&hellip;in a pivotal game that determined the fate of their season. And yet, despite this context&hellip;Kyle Shanahan was all too content running clock before the final quarter even started.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, after that drive, things went awry for San Francisco. CJ Beathard lost all the rhythm he developed from the first eight drives of the game. Come time to try and finally seal a road victory against the Packers, Beathard lost his mojo and collapsed under the pressure. As a result, the last three 49er drives ended in three-and-outs. Not surprisingly, the Packers were able to pull off a comeback with a Mason Crosby field goal that was set up thanks to some fantastic quarterbacking from Aaron Rodgers.</p>

<p>I guess the lesson here is to not trust Kyle Shanahan to keep a lead, at least not when his quarterback is CJ Beathard. Either Shanahan does not fully trust Beathard enough to sustain a lead or the man is simply still trying to hone his game management skills in his second year as a head coach.</p>

			<p>So I sided with the Broncos (+6.5) here in the SuperContest, expecting a bounce-back from Denver after suffering a humiliating defeat against the Jets. On top of that, I expected the cold weather and thin air to stunt the Rams attack somewhat.</p>

<p>So the Rams are making a living off the ground game here, but the Broncos defense has played <em>just</em> <em>well enough</em> to keep their team in the game. Really, it&rsquo;s the offense here that has completely soured.</p>

<p>Two things are really holding back the Broncos - the offensive line and Case Keenum. Let&rsquo;s start off discussing the former - the weak links on that offensive line are being exposed and the coaches are doing little to try and assist their beleaguered linemen with chips and additional blockers. On one of the few times a halfback actually stayed in the pocket to pass protect, a blitzer still managed to bowl him over for a drive-ending sack.</p>

<p>But really, Case Keenum is the one player holding the team back. His deep throws have been off-mark and ill-advised. I understand that you&rsquo;d want to throw deep against a secondary that has been carved up the past two weeks&hellip;but the Rams coaches have clearly worked on patching up some deficiencies on that side. And Keenum has been unable to alter his game in response. On the few times that a player is open in the defensive backfield, Keenum tends to throw some inaccurate passes.</p>

			<p>So didn&rsquo;t do a Supercontest write-up here, but the Colts (+2.5) were one of my picks And it looked somepromising in the first quarter. Despite an unfortunate pick-six on the second play of the game, Andrew Luck and the Colts were producing yards and moving the ball fairly smoothly through the air.</p>

<p>But the Colts went out of their way to prove that the first turnover was no fluke. A fumble in the second quarter helped the Jets post seven more points on the board. Then an interception (induced by tight man coverage) led to three more points for the Jets prior to the second quarter ending. New York now sits as 10-point leaders going into halftime.</p>

<p>Long story short, the Colts receivers are a truly pathetic bunch. And I include the runningbacks in there as well. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe Indy&rsquo;s skill players decided to coat their gloves with butter for shits and giggles, but the team is having a damn hard time possessing the ball, let alone running free from a Jets secondary that are not world-beaters by any means.</p>

<p>I hope Frank Reich is verbally whupping some ass in the locker room as I type this.</p>
