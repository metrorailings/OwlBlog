<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Cam Newton</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Christian McCaffrey (RB), Curtis Samuel (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Greg Olsen (TE), D.J. Moore (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Notable Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Kawann Short (DT), Luke Kuechly (MLB), Brian Burns (LB), Shaq Thompson (OLB), Eric Reid (FS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Marty Hurney (GM), Ron Rivera (HC), Norv Turner (OC), Eric Washington (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas over/Under:</strong> 7.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, things have mostly remained the same, save for the wide receivers coach and the running backs coach being new this year. Not sure what the team is trying to achieve in replacing the coaches overlooking the development of their young skill players, but we’ll see later this season whether the changes pay off.</p>

<p>On defense, we don’t see any turnover, but we do see some additions. The linebackers will now be guided by two coaches instead of one. Likewise, the defensive backs will be coached by two people instead of one. Interestingly enough, the new addition to the secondaries staff is Perry Fewell, who won a Super Bowl as the defensive coordinator with the Giants back in 2011.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think going under the win total is a good play here. It’s unfortunate given that the Panthers are hoping for another Cinderella year this season after Norv Turner’s changes on offense showed some positive results early last season. But the reality is that Carolina’s roster deficiencies combined with Cam Newton’s sloppy quarterbacking can really sink the team’s prospects this season.</p>

<p>Starting with the quarterback&hellip;Newton has never been known to be an accurate passer. And that does not go over well in a league where offenses seem to want nothing more than to pass the ball. The one year that Newton was able to perform beyond expectations was a magical year in which teams around the NFL had no answer for the Panthers and their exotic run packages. The sudden emergence of the Panthers that year was also aided by some injury luck as well, as Cam was able to remain remarkably healthy despite his insistence on running head-first into opposing defenders. Outside that season, Cam’s numbers have been rather pedestrian - if anything, it’s his mobility that’s helped burnish his quarterbacking credentials. But that mobility comes at the risk of serious injury, as we saw towards the second half of last season.</p>

<p>It also doesn’t help that his options at receiver are limited. Without Devin Funchess, the Panthers only have so many weapons available to them. Christian McCaffrey should be solid given his fantastic performance from last season, but the wide receiver situation is a bit shaky - whether Curtis Samuel and D.J. Moore can step up as the team’s definitive starting receivers remains to be seen, though the former did post some solid numbers in his sophomore season last year.</p>

<p>It’s not just receiver where the team is short-handed - outside of Eric Reid, the team lacks quality defensive backs who can blanket opposing skill players in zone coverage. And one can make the same argument about that defensive front - outside of Kawann Short, the Panthers lack impactful talent. Wes Horton and newly-signed veteran Bruce Irvin have shown flashes in the past, but neither have demonstrated consistent success before. Mario Addison is serviceable as an edge rusher, but the man lacks the game-changing ability expected of elite defensive ends.</p>

<p>Yes, I tend to pay more attention to a team’s negatives than its positives, but it’s hard to see positives for this team. Sure, it can and will surprise us every now and then. And yes, Christian McCaffrey will continue to impress as a swiss-knife on offense. But nothing else gives me much hope for this team.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-3"><strong><em>Tier 3</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Matt Ryan</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Julio Jones (WR), Calvin Ridley (WR), Austin Hooper (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Devonta Freeman (RB), Mohamed Sanu (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Notable Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Grady Jarrett (DT), Tak McKinley (DE), Deion Jones (MLB), Keanu Neal (SS), Desmond Trufant (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Thomas Dimitroff (GM), Dan Quinn (HC/New DC), Dirk Koetter (New OC),</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>The turnover here is complicated.</p>

<p>Dirk Koetter was brought in to take charge of the offense after the higher powers in Atlanta fired Steve Sarkisian following his shaky mismanagement of the offense last year. The quarterbacks coach, the offensive line coach, and the wide receivers coach from last year were retained, though the receivers coach will now be training running backs instead this year. Oversight responsibilities for the wide receivers will now fall into the hands of assistant head coach Raheem Morris. The assistants and tight ends coach from last year were replaced with new personnel this year. It’s worth noting that former Titans head coach Mike Mularkey will now be training up the tight ends.</p>

<p>On defense, Marquand Manuel was ousted after a disappointing year managing Atlanta’s defense. Instead, Dan Quinn will now be handling coordinator duties directly. Most of the staff from last year was retained, with the only major change coming with defensive line coach Bryant Young being swapped out for Jess Simpson. Interestingly enough, the team brought Bob Sutton over from Kansas City to serve as a senior assistant on defense.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s hard to get a beat on these Falcons. It’s clear the offense and defense were off last year. The changes to the coaching staff on both sides of the ball this year are a testament to that. And interestingly enough, Atlanta hired a familiar face to coach the offense - Dirk Koetter. The last time Koetter was there, the team only posted six wins to ten losses. Not all of those losses fall on his shoulders however - to his credit, Julio Jones and Matt Ryan were both selected to the Pro Bowl that year, though it’s hard to say whether the former even needs a coach.</p>

<p>Last year made it clear the Falcons feature some solid talent on offense, despite Steve Sarkisian’s schemes constantly putting his skill players in disadvantageous positions. First-round rookie Calvin Ridley showed some promise as a big-play threat. Meanwhile, Matt Ryan finally found a reliable tight-end in Pro Bowler Austin Hooper. And Julio remained as dominant as ever, racking up enough yards to be crowned the league’s receiving champion. The offensive line <strong><em>may</em></strong> have been a point of weakness last year though, which may explain why the team restocked the line this year with fresh faces, signing veteran guards during the offseason and then spending two first-round draft picks on college linemen. So if Koetter can learn from his predecessor’s mistakes and not hamstring his skill players, the Falcons can have one of the best offenses in the league this year, especially if that run game plays as big a role as it did the year the Falcons went to the Super Bowl.</p>

<p>On defense, their undoing last year were injuries and an underwhelming defensive line. Without cornerstone players like Deion Jones and Keanu Neal and lacking a pass rush with any teeth, opposing offenses didn’t have to work hard to mow down that defense. This year, Dan Quinn himself will be calling the plays on defense. On top of that, a new coach will be training up the players lining up along the defensive front. Will those two changes (along with a little bit of injury luck) be enough to turn things around this year? Maybe. At the very least, I see a slight uptick in their performance given how bad they were last year. A defensive-minded head coach should be able to fix a few deficiencies on a defense that ranked among the dregs of the league.</p>

<p>I actually see the team doing far better than it did last year. That being said, the team will struggle to break into the double-digit win territory this year - the Falcons reside in the hardest division in the NFC. Furthermore, Atlanta will be facing off against the Vikings, Eagles, Rams, and Seahawks. A winning record is certainly possible though, so long as Atlanta plays at a high level for most of the season and has a little luck avoiding injuries.</p>

	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<h2 id="tier-1"><strong><em>Tier 1</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Drew Brees</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Michael Thomas (WR), Alvin Kamara (RB), Jared Cook (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Tre’Quan Smith (WR), Ted Ginn Jr (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Cameron Jordan (DE), Marcus Davenport (DE), Demario Davis (OLB), Sheldon Rankins (DT), Marshon Lattimore (CB), Eli Apple (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Mickey Loomis (GM), Sean Payton (HC), Pete Carmichael (OC), Dennis Allen (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 10.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>No significant turnover on either side of the ball.</p>

<hr />

<p>High expectations. The Saints rightfully stand as the presumptive NFC favorites to advance to the Super Bowl. Last year, Brees’ shoulder injury proved to be their undoing in the postseason. With Brees returning to top form this season and the coaching staff from last year having been fully retained, New Orleans stands as the favorite to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl this year.</p>

<p>If the team does have a particular point of weakness, it’s the receiving corps. Poaching Jared Cook from Oakland is a good start towards addressing the deficiencies in this unit, but the Saints need more options at receiver to weather the injury bug and to exploit defenses that shift too much coverage over to Michael Thomas. As I noted above, Tre’Quan Smith and Ted Ginn <strong><em>may</em></strong> be those alternative options, but that remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Also should talk about the defense a bit. All three levels of the defense feature solid talent. Their only deficit comes in the trenches - New Orleans doesn’t have that complementary pass rusher lining up opposite Cameron Jordan. The hope here is that Marcus Davenport can take that next step forward and become a featured edge rusher in his own right.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-4"><strong><em>Tier 4</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Jameis Winston</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Mike Evans (WR), O.J. Howard (TE),</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Chris Godwin (WR), Breshad Perriman (WR), Peyton Barber (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Ndamukong Suh (DT), Jason Pierre-Paul (OLB),</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Jason Licht (GM), Bruce Arians ( New HC), Byron Leftwich (New OC), Todd Bowles (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>The entire offensive coaching staff has been revamped under new head coach, Bruce Arians. Arians sweeps in with an entirely new coaching staff, starting with Byron Leftwich as the offensive coordinator and Todd Bowles at defensive coordinator, followed by a whole slew of fresh position coaches working underneath them.</p>

<hr />

<p>Last year, I correctly billed this team as a bottom-feeder. Jameis Winston disappointed, as expected. The defense didn’t live up to its potential as well, resulting in Mike Smith getting canned midseason.</p>

<p>This year though&hellip;I do expect a bit of a renaissance for Tampa Bay. Sure, the team lost some talent on both sides of the ball - linebacker Kwon Alexander, wide receiver Adam Humphries, and star defensive tackle Gerald McCoy are no longer with the team. But the team’s potential here stems from its solid coaching staff and the surprise factor involved with the arrival of a new coaching regime. I have faith in Bruce Arians being able to correct Jameis and most of his bad habits. I have faith in Todd Bowles conjuring up a defense that’s greater than the sum of its parts. Maybe best of all, I have faith in the history between Arians and much of his coaching staff. There’s a reason why Arians refused to come out of retirement unless he was able to bring many of his former associates with him to Tampa. The rapport that many of the new coaches have with one another (and more importantly, with Arians) will help speed the regime transition along.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that Jameis Winston is so much more likely to thrive under Arians. If there’s one thing both men love, it’s the deep ball. After all, Winston’s recklessness with the football stems from his pathological love of big plays. Even though Dirk Koetter labored to turn Jameis into a more traditional quarterback with structured reads, it didn’t work - his eyes would always trend towards receivers running deeper routes. But Bruce Arian offenses are known for their religious devotion to the big pass play. So unlike most other coaches, Arians would actually encourage Jameis to embrace his risky tendencies and throw the ball deep. In other words, we may end up seeing a surprisingly strong marriage between these two.</p>

<p>I actually think the Buccaneers can get more than six wins this season. In fact, the Buccaneers have an outside shot at winning the division outright. Honestly, I’d be so much more confident declaring Tampa Bay a solid team if this defense wasn’t so woefully lacking in talent. But if younger players like Vita Vea finally step up this year, then this defense may be serviceable.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-6"><strong><em>Tier 6</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Mitch Trubisky</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Mitch Trubisky (Mobile QB), Tarik Cohen (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Allen Robinson (WR), Cordarrelle Patterson (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Akeem Hicks (DT), Khalil Mack (DE), Kyle Fuller (CB), Roquan Smith (LB), Danny Trevathan (LB), Buster Skrine (CB), Prince Amukamara (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Ryan Pace (GM), Matt Nagy (HC), Mark Helfrich (OC), Chuck Pagano (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, the staff has remained fully intact, with the addition of Brad Childress as an advisor.</p>

<p>On defense, we have nearly the complete opposite. Only the defensive line coach and a quality control assistant managed to survive the transition from the Vic Fangio era to the Chuck Pagano era. It is worth noting that the quality control coach that was kept from last year has been reassigned as the safeties coach this year. It’ll be interesting to see if this defense can reassume elite form this year given the defensive coaching overhaul.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Bears impressed last year, finally returning to the playoffs as division champions after an eight-year hiatus. This year, it’ll be a steep uphill battle to defend their position atop the North.</p>

<p>One thing that concerns is that coaching overhaul on defense. The new defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano cut his teeth serving as a defensive backs coach for the better part of his NFL career. While he’s successfully trained up cornerbacks and safeties over the years, his track record managing linebackers and defensive linemen has been rather spotty. Furthermore, coaching regime shifts can sometimes be messy, especially if we have new regimes overseeing a unit that was remarkably successful in its last year. And given the success this Chicago defensive outfit saw last year, I wouldn’t be all too surprised to see some tension between the Bear defenders and their new coaches, especially if these coaches insist on having these players do things that run counter to the style of football that made them so dominant last year.</p>

<p>The other thing that concerns me more is Mitch Trubisky. I look at Mitch and I see another Blake Bortles in the making. Mitch is atrocious as a passer. His fundamentals are out of whack. His throws lack accuracy. His decision-making is still questionable. Sure, he played sensationally in his first playoff game against the Eagles last year&hellip;but so did Blake when the Jaguars marched into the postseason two years ago. Those Jaguars actually fought their way to the conference championship thanks to a few masterful performances from Bortles. And yet, Bortles flunked out of Jacksonville last year, as some analytical experts rightfully predicted.</p>

<p>Can Trubisky improve this year? Sure. Unlike Bortles, Trubisky is still a young buck that has one of the NFL’s better offensive minds coaching him. Maybe Matt Nagy can channel his inner Anne Sullivan and transform Mitch into a functional quarterback&hellip;but my intuition here tells me that Nagy’s efforts will be in vain. That being said, I don’t expect this team to regress as badly as the Jaguars last year. After all, that defense has some spectacular talent. And the Jaguars were special in the way they blew up last year - it wasn’t so much a regression to the mean as it was a catastrophic meltdown. What are the chances of another meltdown happening so soon?</p>

<p>All that being said, another trip to the playoffs is incredibly unlikely for this team, let alone any team with a dysfunctional offense.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Matthew Stafford</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Kenny Golladay (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Kerryon Johnson (RB), Marvin Jones (WR), Danny Amendola (WR), T.J. Hockenson (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Darius Slay (CB), Trey Flowers (DE), Damon Harrison (DT), Mike Daniels (DT)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Bob Quinn (GM), Matt Patricia (HC), Darrell Bevell (New OC), Paul Pasqualoni (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 6.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Despite hiring a new offensive coordinator to helm the offense, the Lions didn’t flip much at the position group level, only replacing the coaches overseeing the quarterbacks and running backs.</p>

<p>On defense, things have remained mostly intact from last year.</p>

<hr />

<p>Last year was a disappointment. Matt Patricia came in and took a very eccentric approach to the way he conducted things as a head coach, even going as far as telling a beat reporter to sit up straight at a press conference. And now this year, the man is proud to have his team straight up touted as the Detroit Patriots, given all the things he’s done to emulate the Patriots’ approach to football and team-building. Apparently, Patricia doesn’t understand that emulating a winning formula is not enough to actually build a winning team. Every organization must foster their own culture and develop their own way of doing things in order to succeed. It’s fine to borrow elements from other organizations, but to cop another team’s style entirely smacks of naivete.</p>

<p>Besides that, Matt Patricia also gambled on the run game last year, opting to make his Lions a run-first team. It wasn’t a prudent decision. Detroit bottomed out of the division in his first year as a head coach. In his defense, one could argue that the Lions lack the raw talent necessary to engineer a dominant rushing attack. But does that even matter? In today’s game, it should be obvious that the air game is so much more valuable compared to the run game. So prioritizing the latter at the expense of the former once again smacks of naivete.</p>

<p>This year, the Lions may see a bit more life on offense under new offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell, but let’s not forget Bevell was run out of Seattle for good reason. Bevell had a strange playbook that mixed good and bad concepts in equal parts. That inconsistency makes failure a very real possibility here. The defense doesn’t seem much better, though it’s worth noting that since scooping up Mike Daniels, the Lions now feature one of the league’s heavier defensive fronts. That should bode well against other teams that need to rush the ball to open up the offense.</p>

<p>All things said, I have a hard time finding positive things worth mentioning about this team. Matt Patricia may be a good coordinator, but his actions as a head coach leaves me baffled. I cannot be high on a team when its head coach perplexes me. Expect a losing season here. It’s very possible for the team to end up as a bottom feeder as well.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-2"><strong><em>Tier 2</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Kirk Cousins</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Adam Thielen (WR), Stefon Diggs (WR), Dalvin Cook (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Kyle Rudolph (TE), Ameer Abdullah (RB), Chad Beebe (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Everson Griffen (DE), Danielle Hunter (DE), Linval Joseph (DT), Anthony Barr (LB), Anthony Kendricks (LB), Harrison Smith (SS), Xavier Rhodes (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Rick Spielman (GM), Mike Zimmer (HC), Kevin Stefanski/Gary Kubiak (New OC), George Edwards (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Even though the interim offensive coordinator has been formally hired into his role this year, things are significantly different on offense. I suspect that’s mostly because of Gary Kubiak coming onboard as an offense guru and the assistant head coach under Mike Zimmer. Other than the running backs coach and an offensive line assistant, the entire staff has been replaced from last year.</p>

<p>On defense, however, things have remained the same. The only change has come with the addition of Terence Newman as an assistant defensive backs coach. While Newman didn’t exactly light the world on fire as a cornerback, the former player understands the finer aspects of Zimmer’s system and has the experience needed to mentor younger defensive backs.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Vikings last year had their postseason hopes dashed due to some awkward performances from Kirk Cousins, some horrendous pass protection from an underwhelming offensive line, and some bad coaching from then offensive coordinator John DeFilippo. Mike Zimmer thankfully fired DeFilippo near the end of the season the moment it became obvious that the team could not count on him to coach a consistently viable offense. In his place went Kevin Stefanski, who impressed enough to keep his job this year, even as the team brought Gary Kubiak onboard as an advisor.</p>

<p>Honestly, now that I look at this Vikings team&hellip;.I’m looking at a Super Bowl contender here. Minnesota has the makings of a championship team - a solid coaching staff, a roster loaded with quality players across the board, a franchise quarterback, and a respectable home field advantage.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the team is without weak points. One major downside that concerns me is the offensive line - Minnesota lacks any decent depth along the trenches on offense. Even though the Vikings spent a first-round draft pick this year on a center, it’s still going to take some time for the rookie to get up to speed. Furthermore, the Vikings released most of their guards from last year, leaving them cripplingly thin along the interior of the line. The signing of Josh Kline and the drafting of Dru Samia provides some superficial depth, but one injury along the line could cause havoc and trigger a reshuffling, in which linemen will once again be forced to play out of their natural positions in a desperate attempt to field a workable offensive line. Kirk Cousins would suffer the most if the Vikings are forced to reorganize the offensive line, as the man needs all the help he can get.</p>

<p>We also see some major overhaul along the offensive coaching staff, courtesy of Gary Kubiak. It usually takes some time for a new coaching staff to synergize with the players. But new coaching regimes have taken teams to the Super Bowl before. It does help to have a strong defense that can back up an offense still adjusting to a new scheme. Not only that, but Kubiak has won a Super Bowl in his own right with the Broncos several years ago. So I wouldn’t be too worried about the new offensive coaches here - they should be able to find their bearings sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>I expect this team to win the North and contend with the Eagles and the Saints for the NFC crown.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-5"><strong><em>Tier 5</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Aaron Rodgers</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Davante Adams (WR), Aaron Rodgers (Mobile QB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Aaron Jones (RB), Jimmy Graham (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Za’Darius Smith (DT/LB), Preston Smith (OLB), Rashan Gary (OLB), Adrian Amos (SS), Jaire Alexander (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Brian Gutekunst (GM), Matt LaFleur (New HC), Nathaniel Hackett (New OC), Mike Pettine (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, only the running backs coach from last year managed to survive the Packers’ transition away from the Mike McCarthy era.</p>

<p>On defense, even though Mike Pettine was retained as the defensive coordinator, most of the assistants underneath him have been flipped. Only the defensive line coach and the secondaries coach have been kept from last year. Interestingly enough, none of the defensive coaches have been designated as run game or pass game coordinators - it seems the end of the McCarthy era means no more defensive sub-coordinators to complicate the coaching structure.</p>

<hr />

<p>Note that the Packers are favored to end the season on a winning record. I find that fascinating.</p>

<p>On one hand, it’s not that difficult to make a great case for the Packers doing well this year. Aaron Rodgers is still one of the best quarterbacks in the game, injuries be damned. The defensive roster this year better reflects Mike Pettine’s vision of an ideal defense. Matt LaFleur’s approach to offensive football is refreshingly different from that of Mike McCarthy’s.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, pessimists can make the argument that all these coaching, philosophical, and personnel changes are too much for any team to grasp in the matter of a few months - in other words, it’ll take time for these Packers to bond with one another, let alone adopt a new style of offense that’s significantly different from the offense they’ve been running over the last several years under McCarthy.</p>

<p>The pessimist argument rings truer to me then the optimist’s outlook. Sure, I’m more inclined towards arguments that sow doubt over hope&hellip;but the reality is that the Packers have made so many dramatic changes heading into this season. All these new parts that were brought into the fold this year need some time to settle into place. So expect a slow start followed by steady improvement. A postseason berth is not completely impossible here, but it’s going to require some serious misfortune befalling on their division rivals and the emergence of a second wide receiver that can complement Davante Adams.</p>
