			<h2 id="bills-giants">Bills @ Giants</h2>

<p>The Bills&rsquo; man coverage is real.</p>

<p>The Giants&rsquo; man coverage is lame though. DeAndre Baker is a particular point of weakness.</p>

<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for some early runs from Saquon Barkley and slant routes, the Giants offense would have been complete rudderless.</p>

<p>Josh Allen is committing to staying in the pocket. Though it&rsquo;s easy to do so considering New York&rsquo;s gutless pass rush.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="49ers-bengals">49ers @ Bengals</h2>

<p>Kwan Alexander is quite passionate and embraces the leadership role he&rsquo;s been given on defense.</p>

<p>The Bengals are looking hopeless at defending against teams that are good at running the ball. Outside runs in particular bewilder Cincinnati&rsquo;s defense.</p>

<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s misdirection on play-action resulting in big plays.</p>

<p>Lack of creativity by the Bengals offense. Was the game plan here really to simply drop Andy Dalton back five or seven paces behind his offensive line and have him sling the ball to his receivers, with an occasional run by Joe Mixon?</p>

<p>Cincinnati&rsquo;s defense is a mess in coverage and run defense.</p>

<p>Playing from behind leaves the Cincinnati offense in a bit of a precarious situation, given their offensive line kinda sucks in pass protection</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="eagles-falcons">Eagles @ Falcons</h2>

<p>Isaac Seumalo is a point of weakness along the Eagles offensive line.</p>

<p>Grady Jarrett is a beast. Easily the best pass rusher on Atlanta&rsquo;s defensive line.</p>

<p>Creative blitzes by Jim Schwartz is throwing Matt Ryan off his game and keeping the Eagles alive in this game. Worth noting that these blitzes usually  mandate man coverage with no safety patrolling the deep field.</p>

<p>Carson Wentz playing sensationally despite not having either Desean Jackson or Alshon Jeffery on offense.</p>

<p>Calvin Ridley is undoubtedly the Falcons&rsquo; second receiver.</p>

<p>Considering the injury circumstances and the emotional edge in this game going to the Falcons, the Eagles were the better team here.</p>

			<h4 id="49ers-bengals-2-0">49ers @ <em>Bengals</em> (-2.0)</h4>

<p>Kind of weird for me to go with a team that I ranked as a dreg-tier team before the season. But Cincinnati truly impressed me last week, going up to the Clink to face off against a Seattle defense that prepped well for a McVay-style offense. Instead, the Bengals offense seems to have developed its own identity, one that suits Andy Dalton from what I saw last week. The Bengals are a far better team than I thought them to be - to my chagrin, coach Zac Taylor seems to know what he’s doing. I expect them to punk this underperforming 49ers team.</p>

<h4 id="colts-titans-3"><em>Colts</em> @ Titans (-3)</h4>

<p>I don’t think all that much of the Titans smacking around the Browns last week. What concerns me about Tennessee here is that Derrick Henry is the focal point of their offense, instead of Marcus Mariota. It tells me quite a bit about what the coaches think of their young signal caller. In contrast, the Colts look as if they’re comfortable with Jacoby Brissett under center. I think Frank Reich’s dominance of these Titans will not be stopped in this game.</p>

<h4 id="seahawks-steelers-4">Seahawks @ <em>Steelers</em> (-4)</h4>

<p>It’s hard for me to initially side with these Steelers after their dismal showing last week against the Patriots. But the Seahawks weren’t that much better in their own game against the Bengals. It still looks to me that Seattle is still developing an identity on offense that maximizes the contributions of their noteworthy skill players. And they’re taking their sweet time figuring things out too unfortunately. Given Pittsburgh’s history of turning things around fairly quickly, I expect the Steelers offense to see more success here than Seattle’s. Playing on their home turf will also help Pittsburgh settle into a groove quicker.</p>

<h4 id="bears-broncos-2-5">Bears @ <em>Broncos</em> (+2.5)</h4>

<p>Nobody should know Mitch Trubisky’s little quirks and tendencies better than the defensive coordinator that sparred with him in practice for the last two years. Combine that with the thin air of Mile High Stadium and the Bears offense should put forth another hopeless performance this season. So long as Flacco keeps his incontinence under control on a few drives, Denver can put up just enough points to steal a win here.</p>

<h4 id="saints-rams-2-5"><em>Saints</em> @ Rams (-2.5)</h4>

<p>The Rams played terribly last week. Makes me wonder if the last Super Bowl actually exposed their weaknesses to the rest of the league. Either way, the team still has one of the best coaches in the league in Sean McVay. But I would argue the Saints have a better coach in Sean Payton. That, the revenge angle, and the fact that Drew Brees is much better than Jared Goff has me siding with the Saints. Taking the points is nice too.</p>

			<h2 id="chiefs-jaguars">Chiefs @ Jaguars</h2>

<p>The one team unable to handle the humidity in Jacksonville today were&hellip;the Jaguars. How? It seemed like the Kansas City players were having a merry old time playing out there in the searing heat while the Jaguars defenders were looking exhausted by the second quarter. How the hell is this even possible? Did these Jaguars never once practice outside during training camp? I just don&rsquo;t get it. But it&rsquo;s clear the humidity did kill any hope these Jaguars had at keeping the game close. Too many Jaguar defenders were whiffing on tackles and slow to react to the Chiefs and their offensive trickery. Not to mention all the penalties the team racked up over the course of the game.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, Myles Jack being ejected for throwing a punch doesn&rsquo;t sit well with me. The season&rsquo;s started and you already have a leader on this team causing unnecessary drama over something as menial as a push. Makes me wonder whether this team really learned its lesson from last year when the entire defense collectively lost its religion several weeks into the season.</p>

<p>Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye were giving up more receptions than stopping them. Not a good thing when your elite defensive backs are themselves making the case to no longer be considered elite.</p>

<p>Sammy Watkins shined today, especially in Tyreek Hill&rsquo;s absence.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="giants-cowboys">Giants @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>Kellen Moore as offensive coordinator has been allowed to weave more creativity into the playbook, particularly when it comes to play-action concepts. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see whether the Cowboys can continue executing on these concepts as the season goes on.</p>

<p>The Giants will likely have one of the worst defenses in the league. The secondary in particular played rough today - blown assignments and naïveté summed up their day (more or less). It also didn&rsquo;t help that the Giants were generating virtually zero pressure with their defensive front alone. Lorenzo Carter and Markus Golden were not able to win inside the trenches today. Blitzes were the only way Bettcher was able to pressure Dak from time to time. Unfortunately, blitzes only further exposed a defensive backfield playing out of its depth.</p>

<p>Eli Manning played far better than I expected, even connecting on a few big passes. I guess a better offensive line can go a long way towards helping a quarterback rebuild his confidence. Or maybe it&rsquo;s the fire that&rsquo;s lit under his ass knowing that his heir apparent stands on the sidelines waiting for his name to be called&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="steelers-patriots">Steelers @ Patriots</h2>

<p>It looks like Pittsburgh will really end up missing the services of Antonio Brown. None of the other wide receivers seem to be stepping up outside of Juju Smith-Schuster to make up for the former Steeler&rsquo;s missed presence on the field.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh is still a bit slow at the linebacker position. New England is making a point of attacking these linebackers by running their halfbacks out of the backfield on routes.</p>

<p>The Patriots are truly a brilliant team. The quickness with which they can adjust on offense as opposing defense starts to adjust wows me. And that defensive line plays far better than the sum of its parts. It amazes me to see New England occasionally pressure the quarterback rushing only three defensive linemen. Generally, three-man rushes are doomed to fail.</p>

<p>New England will be goddamn scary on offense if they can work Josh Gordon and Antonio Brown into plays together.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bengals-seahawks">Bengals @ Seahawks</h2>

<p>The Bengals are impressing me here. It&rsquo;s clear to me that Cincinnati is the better team. All the more remarkable too considering the team doesn&rsquo;t have many new faces on their roster. The new coaches have done some fantastic work breathing new life into a team many considered one of the worst franchises in professional football last year.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I&rsquo;m also impressed at the way Zac Taylor keeps himself composed standing on the sidelines. Never overly emotional, nor does he look out of his depth. Likewise, his defensive coordinator shares the same stoic demeanor.</p>

<p>Andy Dalton looks far more comfortable in this offense, given the quickness of his passes and his overall composure in the pocket.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="49ers-buccaneers">49ers @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Tampa Bay cannot rely on either Demar Dotson or Donovan Smith as starting tackles. Especially because Winston tends to flinch every time an opposing pass rusher breathes on him. Unless Jameis manages to find inner peace real soon as the pocket crumbles around him, it&rsquo;s going to be a long season for this Buccaneers offense. I&rsquo;m beginning to doubt whether Bruce Arians can turn Winston into a capable quarterback.</p>

<p>So far, the 49ers biggest additions to the defensive line have not disappointed. Dee Ford and Nick Bosa have been consistently winning their battles at the line of scrimmage. It helps that lining up in wide-nine stances forces Tampa Bay&rsquo;s tight ends to match up with them in pass protection sometimes, though I wonder if the Bucs&rsquo; tight ends are honestly that much worser than the Bucs&rsquo; tackles at holding back against edge rushers.</p>

<p>The 49ers pass coverage still remains problematic. Nothing better exemplifies this than the defense giving up 18 yards on a 3rd and 17 <em>while playing sticks coverage</em>. If San Francisco is to be effective on defense, then the defensive line will clearly be leading the way. Though the line&rsquo;s rushing defense is suspect as well, given the smaller size of the front.</p>

<p>Penalties ruled the day here. Alex Kemp and his coaching staff are a litigious bunch. Something worth keeping in mind for future bets.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-saints">Texans @ Saints</h2>

<p>Texans seem to prefer fielding two tight ends at once on offense.</p>

<p>More interesting though, Deshaun Watson turns his back when selling play-action. Opposing defenses can send cornerback blitzes to throw him off as soon as he turns back around. The Saints have done that successfully on a number of occasions.</p>

<p>The Saints clock management towards the end of the game was simply phenomenal. With only thirty or so seconds left, the Saints were able to matriculate the ball down the field for a game-winning field goal. The last time-out wasn&rsquo;t even burned until after the very last offensive play, giving the Saints the flexibility to throw the ball down the middle of the field if need be. The receivers were trained well too, going down quickly after catches in order to conserve as much time as possible.</p>

<p>Deandre Hopkins is a beast. Deshaun Watson is fantastic with the big throws. And the Texans seem to have gotten better with some of their offensive play-calling, even fooling the Saints defense on occasion with misdirection plays.</p>

<p>Alvin Kamara is simply irreplaceable.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-browns">Titans @ Browns</h2>

<p>The Browns are out of control. So many unnecessary penalties holding them back&hellip;</p>

<p>The Titans, on the other hand, are well-composed and play some sound (albeit boring) football. It seems as if the coaches trust Derrick Henry more than they trust Marcus Mariota.</p>

<p>Tennessee does have issues along the offensive line, as the Browns defensive front were constantly winning their battles in the trenches.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, Cleveland too has a major issue on their offensive line - their right tackle Hubbard. Just going by this game alone, I can tell Cleveland&rsquo;s tackles won&rsquo;t be doing Baker any favors this season.</p>

<p>Baker Mayfield made some good throws, though. The second-year passer still has some ways to go when it comes to decision-making and reading opposing defenses. Mayfield still needs more time leveling up.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-6"><strong><em>Tier 6</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Jimmy Garoffalo</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>George Kittle (TE), Kyle Juszczyk (FB), Tevin Coleman (RB), Marquise Goodwin (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Jordan Matthews (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>DeForest Buckner (DT), Dee Ford (DE), Nick Bosa (DE), Kwon Alexander (LB), Richard Sherman (CB), Jason Verrett (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>John Lynch (GM), Kyle Shanahan (HC/OC), Robert Saleh (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 8</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, we see a bit of organization and the hiring of even more coaches. Mike LaFleur is no longer the wide receivers coach, though he will remain in his other role as the passing game coordinator. Instead, former star receiver Wes Welker now takes over as the wide receivers coach. Furthermore, a new quarterbacks coach has been hired now that the old one has gone to Denver to serve as their offensive coordinator. Lastly, we see a little shake-up among the offensive assistants, with two of the assistants being released and three new ones being hired this year.</p>

<p>On defense, we see two major changes. The first comes in the backfield, with Joe Woods now taking over as the team’s main secondaries coach and defensive passing game coordinator. The second and more important change comes along that defensive front - a new coach will now be overseeing that group after the old one was fired for fielding a unit that failed to rush the passer effectively.</p>

<hr />

<p>After Jimmy Garoffalo’s untimely ACL tear early in the season, it didn’t take long for the 49ers to quickly spiral downward. Their lack of depth didn’t do the back-up quarterbacks any favors as well.</p>

<p>The team’s prospects this season are a little better, so long as the injury bug doesn’t expose their lack of depth and leaves them crippled at quarterback yet again. The team found a sound complement to Marquise Goodwin in George Kettle. The newly-signed Tevin Coleman should be ready to contribute as well, being familiar with Kyle Shanahan and his system from their time together in Atlanta. Furthermore, the defensive line looks more promising this year, now that Dee Ford and Nick Bosa will be lining up alongside DeForest Buckner. Then again, it’s possible neither of the two additions will pan out - Dee Ford has only posted one solid year so far in his professional career and Nick Bosa is as injury-prone as his older brother. In fact, Bosa is already questionable for the first week. So it’s very possible the 49ers will find themselves saddled with a hopeless pass rush yet again. And that doesn’t bode well for a defensive unit that failed as a whole last year. Though maybe the addition of Kwon Alexander to the linebacking corps could help the back seven limber up - after all, cover-3 defensive shells pretty much mandate a capable middle linebacker in order to see any sustained success. His time in Tampa ended in mixed reviews though, so it remains to be seen whether Alexander can truly deliver.</p>

<p>It’s hard to pin this team’s fortunes this year. Much of their success will depend on the health of key players (most of whom I’ve discussed in the prior paragraph). And even still, the question I posed last year still very much applies this year - will Jimmy Garoffalo be able to step up this season now that the other teams in the league are fully aware of his potential as a starting-caliber quarterback? While his limited play time last year doesn’t offer up much insight about his future prospects, it’s worth noting the young man underwhelmed in the two games he was able to play out. If I was forced to take a side here, I’d go with this team posting a losing record this season.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-6"><strong><em>Tier 6</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Kyler Murray</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Christian Kirk (WR), David Johnson (RB), Kyler Murray (Mobile QB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Larry Fitzgerald (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Chandler Jones (DE), Terrell Suggs (OLB), Jordan Hicks (ILB), Patrick Peterson (CB), Budda Baker (S)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Steve Keim (GM), Kliff Kingsbury (New HC), Tom Clements (New OC), Vance Joseph (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>With the exception of a few assistant coaches, the entire coaching staff has been flipped from the top-down.</p>

<hr />

<p>Last year’s experiment failed dismally. This year’s experiment is likely to go down that same track.</p>

<p>Kliff Kingsbury is bringing with him a style of football known as the Air Raid offense. In this system, the pass game is dramatically emphasized, often with 10 personnel sets. Generally, rushing plays are only invoked with audibles. (Often undersized) offensive linemen are spaced farther apart from one another on the line of scrimmage in order to give the passer a bit more time to air the ball out.</p>

<p>Passing plays will (more or less) fall within one of two categories - the verticals play and the mesh play. In a verticals play, four skill players spread out and run deeper routes. One player may break his route early and cut inside towards the middle of the field to create an outlet should the passer be under duress. In a mesh play, the receivers run crossing routes designed to rub coverage defenders off of them.</p>

<p>So the big question here is whether the Cardinals will eventually see success this year following this style of football. I’m not too sure. It’ll take time for a wholly new coaching staff to teach an offensive philosophy that has not been fully embraced in the NFL. On top of that, Kyler Murray is an undersized quarterback playing behind the league’s shakiest offensive line. Things don’t bode well for the rookie unless he’s able to make magic with his legs.</p>

<p>Then again, Chip Kelly was able to find success pretty quickly after bringing his style of football to the Eagles. It took defenses quite a bit of time to finally catch up and counter the high tempo of his playcalling, even though people were long aware of his approach to football before his name was even considered for a head coaching position. And that’s a reality we must heed when it comes to defensive football - defenses can only react to new offensive trends. It’s why innovations in offense tend to go through some sort of honeymoon period in which they seem unstoppable. The Eagles under Chip Kelly, the Rams of the last two years, the Panthers and their exotic rushes three years ago&hellip;all these new-school offenses took the world by storm for a season or two before flushing out. So Kingsbury and his Air Raid offense <strong>could</strong> follow the same trajectory as well.</p>

<p>But then one would have to ask if the Air Raid is really that radical a concept in today’s NFL? After all, it’s obvious the league has been emphasizing the passing game more and more over the last several years. Offenses regularly send four skill players out on routes during pass plays. It could be argued that defenses have been adjusting to this trend for the better part of the decade. The Air Raid philosophy simply raises this emphasis on the air game at the expense of the rushing attack. So one would think defenses would be able to react quick here. Then again, the Rams are effectively running a tweaked version of the Shanahan system and it still took two seasons for defenses to properly catch up….</p>

			<h2 id="tier-3"><strong><em>Tier 3</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Jared Goff</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Todd Gurley (RB), Robert Woods (WR), Cooper Kupp (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Brandin Cooks (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Aaron Donald (DT)</em>, <em>Clay Matthews (DE), Marcus Peters (CB), Aqib Talib (CB), Eric Weddle (FS), Taylor Rapp (SS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Les Snead (GM), Sean McVay (HC/OC), Wade Phillips (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 10.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Zac Taylor, last year’s quarterbacks coach, left to become head coach of the Bengals,. However, with a little bit of reorganization, his role has been taken up by the passing game coordinator from last year. Furthermore, the team added Wes Phillips as the tight ends coach this time around. Not a bad move considering Wes and Sean McVay have some history working together back in Washington and the tight end unit was a point of weakness last year. Aside from those two changes, the offensive coaching staff remains intact.</p>

<p>On defense, the defensive line now has a new coach overseeing the unit. Yet another good move by the team considering the pass rush was another point of weakness last year, despite headlining the defensive player of the year in Aaron Donald. If the Rams had a truly dominant pass rush, the city of Los Angeles would be basking in the glow of their second Lombardi Trophy right now. Whether the new defensive line coach could turn things around remains to be seen, though it’s worth noting that the man has some good experience working with solid edge rushers during his tenure with the Chargers.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Rams were a hot team last year, fighting their way all the way to the Super Bowl only to lose embarrassingly to the Patriots. The team performed remarkably well relative to my expectations - I was convinced the rest of the league would crack their offensive scheme sooner rather than later, effectively neutralizing most of their potential on offense. It wasn’t until the end of the season that opposing teams finally gained a beat on their offense, thanks in large part to Matt Patricia.</p>

<p>Even still&hellip;the Rams are not an easy team to stop so long as they remain fully healthy. Todd Gurley and Cooper Kupp were clearly missed last year - both players do far more on offense than any of the other skill players. Gurley is the lynchpin behind the rushing attack and the short passing game. Kupp is the team’s most critical receiver, period. Without those two players, the Rams were still able to move the ball down the field, but it lacked that crisp quality that really took the league by storm earlier in the year. For this team to keep winning with their current offensive identity, they need some more luck on the injury front.</p>

<p>But then again, the real question we should be asking here is whether Jared Goff can actually take that step forward and stake himself as a truly elite quarterback. Despite his flashy numbers from last season, his success was more a result of fantastic scheming rather than transcendent talent. All things said, Goff ranks as an average quarterback in my eyes. But it’s only his fourth season - there’s still room for him to grow and better himself. So can he do that? Intuition tells me no, but my hunches about this team last year were pretty badly off. So let’s see…</p>

<p>One more thing worth talking about is the defense. By swapping out LaMarcus Joyner with Eric Weddle and Ndamukong Suh with Clay Matthews, the team seems intent on wising up their defense with veteran athletes. If Aqib Talib, Marcus Peters, Eric Weddle, and first-round rookie Taylor Rapp could all excel at press coverage, that would afford Wade Phillips the liberty to blitz more players against opposing quarterbacks. And that&rsquo;s a style of defense that suits Wade just fine. So expect this defense to surge a bit this year, probably as the offense regresses. The extent to which the defense improves and the offense slows down will determine whether the Rams can hold on to the division crown.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-2"><strong><em>Tier 2</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Russell Wilson</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Russell Wilson (Mobile QB), Tyler Lockett (WR), Chris Carson (RB), Will Dissly (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>N/A</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Jadeveon Clowney (DE), Ezekiel Ansah (DE), L.J. Collier (DE), Jarran Reed (DT), Bobby Wagner (LB), Bradley McDougald (SS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>John Schneider (GM), Pete Carroll (HC), Brian Schottenheimer (OC), Ken Norton Jr (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 8.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, the team added a few more assistants to the staff.</p>

<p>On defense, nothing changed coaching-wise from last year.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before I started looking at this team, I wasn’t expecting much. The Seahawks lost a few too many critical players from last year - Doug Baldwin, Earl Thomas, and Frank Clark. Upon further review though, it became evident I was overrating some of these players. Baldwin has aged out of his prime and Earl Thomas is approaching the tail end of his career. Frank Clark’s presence will be missed though, as he was the best pass rusher on a team that was pretty bare along the defensive front in the first place. But after doing some accounting of players on the roster, I realized that the team has been going out of its way to address its deficiencies along the defensive line.</p>

<p>It all started with John Schneider taking a low-risk gamble by signing Ezekiel Ansah to a one-year deal - if Ansah can finally buck the injury bug that’s plagued him the past few years, then it’s likely this gamble pays off big. Then the Seahawks went and spent premium draft capital on a promising edge rushing prospect in L.J. Collier. While Collier is not expected to replace Frank Clark’s production right away, I think the team thought that pairing him with Ezekiel Ansah and Jarran Reed may be enough to keep that pass rush humming. However, seeing the Texans desperate to rid themselves of Jadaveon Clowney, Schneider jumped at the opportunity to acquire the former first-pick from Houston for next to nothing. Clowney is a proven commodity as a defensive end - so long as the man remains healthy, the Hawks can count on him as a premiere pass rusher. So it seems the Seahawks defense may not be as barebones as I once thought.</p>

<p>Same with the offense too. Doug Baldwin will be sorely missed as a veteran leader and an outside receiver, but Seattle still has options at offense. If player performances from last year are strongly indicative of player performances this year, then Seattle should be able to count on Tyler Lockett, Chris Carson, and Will Dissly to produce on offense. Generally, good coaches can keep good players playing well year-over-year, so I expect all three skill players to stand out yet again. Best of all, those three have different roles from one another on offense, giving Seattle the freedom to weave more creative and intricate concepts into their playbook.</p>

<p>So given the surprisingly robust roster and the coaching staff remaining almost entirely intact from last year, I actually expect good things from the Hawks this year.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Cam Newton</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Christian McCaffrey (RB), Curtis Samuel (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Greg Olsen (TE), D.J. Moore (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Notable Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Kawann Short (DT), Luke Kuechly (MLB), Brian Burns (LB), Shaq Thompson (OLB), Eric Reid (FS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Marty Hurney (GM), Ron Rivera (HC), Norv Turner (OC), Eric Washington (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas over/Under:</strong> 7.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, things have mostly remained the same, save for the wide receivers coach and the running backs coach being new this year. Not sure what the team is trying to achieve in replacing the coaches overlooking the development of their young skill players, but we’ll see later this season whether the changes pay off.</p>

<p>On defense, we don’t see any turnover, but we do see some additions. The linebackers will now be guided by two coaches instead of one. Likewise, the defensive backs will be coached by two people instead of one. Interestingly enough, the new addition to the secondaries staff is Perry Fewell, who won a Super Bowl as the defensive coordinator with the Giants back in 2011.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think going under the win total is a good play here. It’s unfortunate given that the Panthers are hoping for another Cinderella year this season after Norv Turner’s changes on offense showed some positive results early last season. But the reality is that Carolina’s roster deficiencies combined with Cam Newton’s sloppy quarterbacking can really sink the team’s prospects this season.</p>

<p>Starting with the quarterback&hellip;Newton has never been known to be an accurate passer. And that does not go over well in a league where offenses seem to want nothing more than to pass the ball. The one year that Newton was able to perform beyond expectations was a magical year in which teams around the NFL had no answer for the Panthers and their exotic run packages. The sudden emergence of the Panthers that year was also aided by some injury luck as well, as Cam was able to remain remarkably healthy despite his insistence on running head-first into opposing defenders. Outside that season, Cam’s numbers have been rather pedestrian - if anything, it’s his mobility that’s helped burnish his quarterbacking credentials. But that mobility comes at the risk of serious injury, as we saw towards the second half of last season.</p>

<p>It also doesn’t help that his options at receiver are limited. Without Devin Funchess, the Panthers only have so many weapons available to them. Christian McCaffrey should be solid given his fantastic performance from last season, but the wide receiver situation is a bit shaky - whether Curtis Samuel and D.J. Moore can step up as the team’s definitive starting receivers remains to be seen, though the former did post some solid numbers in his sophomore season last year.</p>

<p>It’s not just receiver where the team is short-handed - outside of Eric Reid, the team lacks quality defensive backs who can blanket opposing skill players in zone coverage. And one can make the same argument about that defensive front - outside of Kawann Short, the Panthers lack impactful talent. Wes Horton and newly-signed veteran Bruce Irvin have shown flashes in the past, but neither have demonstrated consistent success before. Mario Addison is serviceable as an edge rusher, but the man lacks the game-changing ability expected of elite defensive ends.</p>

<p>Yes, I tend to pay more attention to a team’s negatives than its positives, but it’s hard to see positives for this team. Sure, it can and will surprise us every now and then. And yes, Christian McCaffrey will continue to impress as a swiss-knife on offense. But nothing else gives me much hope for this team.</p>
