	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - New Orleans Saints</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Saints are oddly only the 3rd seed in the NFC due to some unfortunate luck when Drew Brees injured his thumb against the Rams and an underprepared Teddy Bridgewater had to step into his place. Even still, New Orleans has been billed as one of the favorites to win. Let&rsquo;s use the  the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a> to see exactly why.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>No doubt. Winning five straight games without Drew Brees alone proves the team can handle hardship. Their comeback win against a surging Titans team in Tennessee is another fine example that exemplifies this team&rsquo;s mental fortitude.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Dennis Allen&rsquo;s tenure as the Saints defensive coach has been largely successful. This year is no different. All three levels of his defense have impressed in one way or another.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes, these Saints have become fixtures in the playoffs, going three years now with postseason outings.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes. Brees continues to break passing records in this league. And unlike last year, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like any nagging injury will be sapping him of his talent.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Sean Payton&rsquo;s a fantastic coach and an even better offensive mind. His ability to scheme up quick passes for Drew Brees has allowed this offense to consistently move the chains on first and second downs instead of third down.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Cameron Jordan</em></strong> can safely be considered an elite pass rusher, given his numbers alone and consistency in production.</p>

<p>While Marcus Davenport, the Saints other starting edge rusher, has been relegated to injured reserve for the season, New Orleans might actually have another man that can step up and pressure the passer on a consistent basis - <strong><em>Demario Davis</em></strong>. Even though Davis has been limited in the number of times he&rsquo;s allowed to rush into the offensive backfield, he&rsquo;s been surprisingly efficient when doing so as of lately. Over the past six weeks, he&rsquo;s tallied up six hits on opposing quarterbacks over 73 rushes. Not too shabby for a middle linebacker.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Saints have at least four different vectors on offense.</p>

<p>The most important one is is <strong><em>Michael Thomas</em></strong>, who earned his billing as the best wide receiver in the NFL this season.</p>

<p><strong><em>Alvin Kamara</em></strong> has still been playing at a high level, even if his numbers are not as impressive as in years past.</p>

<p>The Saints&rsquo; investment in <strong><em>Jared Cook</em></strong> this offseason has paid off in spades, as Drew Brees has found himself a tight end that can run routes along the middle of the field and make tough catches when necessary. In one year, he&rsquo;s become a vital part of the offense, posting over two yards per route run, according to Pro Football Focus.</p>

<p>Lastly, <strong><em>Taysom Hill</em></strong> continues to serve the team well as a utility player who can run all sorts of plays from the quarterback position given his athleticism.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only during the Wild Card round, most likely.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Yes. Will Lutz has been solid this year outside of one bad game against the Bears. I&rsquo;m not sure if the Soldier Field turf played a role in that game though. Either way, his selection to the Pro Bowl this year justifies his consideration as a reliable field goal kicker.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Yes, Marshon Lattimore qualifies here, given his reputation as a shutdown corner.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Saints hold so much promise this year. Though without a bye and real home-field advantage, the Saints still stand as Super Bowl favorites in my book.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Houston Texans</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Texans have limped into the playoffs as the fourth seed in the AFC. Let&rsquo;s use the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a> to see if they can go far in the postseason.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Not sure. The Texans have been great at staging late-game comebacks, even on the road. But Houston is such a bipolar team - it seems every good performance is followed by a bad showing. Great showings against the likes of the Chiefs, Patriots, Saints, and Titans have been accompanied by sad displays against the Jaguars, Broncos, Raiders, and Buccaneers.</p>

<p>It seems this team phones in performances whenever they&rsquo;re significant favorites, similar to the championship Giants of 2011. Except those Giants went through a gauntlet of playoff-caliber teams midway through the season that really helped them adjust mentally to a difficult postseason. The Texans haven&rsquo;t gone through a murderer&rsquo;s row of games this season.</p>

<p>Houston did go through some hardships this season when they lost JJ Watt for half the season. While none of its other pass rushers have stepped up in Watt&rsquo;s absence, the Texans defense were able to compensate with some strong performances from the revamped defensive backfield.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll say yes here though, going off Bill O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s past history.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue yes. Romeo Crennel&rsquo;s willingness to experiment with the blitz and incorporate cast-offs into his defensive backfield says something about his drive to make this defense better. The defense also had a few stellar games this year, most notably against the Patriots in a big prime-time spot and the Jaguars over in London.</p>

<p>One thing does give me pause here - the way the defense has choked away yardage this year compared to years past. It&rsquo;s just not the same defense - this team has been too happy giving up yardage. Then again, maybe Houston can&rsquo;t help itself in this area given the impotence of the pass rush following JJ Watt&rsquo;s chest injury.</p>

<p>Either way, I&rsquo;ll give the benefit of the doubt to Romeo Crennel once again going off history.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes, they do.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Without a doubt. Lamar Jackson aside, Deshaun Watson has been the most electric quarterback this season. The Texans are never out of contention so long as Watson is leading this offense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>No. I see Bill O&rsquo;Brien has more of an appetite this season for experimentation and change, but he still baffles me with his insistence on running offensive concepts that&rsquo;ve been failing more often than not. His blind devotion to inside zone runs and his poor play-action scheming are good examples of concepts that are featured prominently in the playbook even if they haven&rsquo;t proven themselves over long stretches.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>Only one - <strong><em>JJ Watt</em></strong>. As Rivers McCown has noted time and time again in his articles about the Texans this year, nobody else on Houston has stepped up in Watt&rsquo;s absense. Jacob Martin and Whitney Mercilus have shown flashes of brilliance, but neither have been consistent.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Texans feature four different vectors here. Their top receiver is <strong><em>DeAndre Hopkins</em></strong>. His AP All-Pro designation this year speaks for itself. <strong><em>Will Fuller</em></strong> also counts as a vector, given his role as the team&rsquo;s main deep threat. Even though Fuller is a basket case when it comes to injury, his presence on offense makes a serious difference - statistical downturns have been documented when Fuller is missing in action. Even though Fuller will be sidelined for the Wild Card game, I&rsquo;m still counting him as a vector as he may be a factor in the games going forward.</p>

<p>When it comes to the ground game, the Texans are pretty productive with the combo of <strong><em>Carlos Hyde</em></strong> and <strong><em>Duke Johnson</em></strong>. Duke Johnson provides more versatility in the passing game whereas Carlos Hyde has been a workhorse, rushing the ball for over 1000 yards on 245 rushes.  And we can&rsquo;t forget about <strong><em>Deshaun Watson</em></strong> and his ability to scramble as well. In fact, the success of their ground game can be partly traced to teams having to honor Watson&rsquo;s ability to run with the ball.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Not sure. Ka&rsquo;imi Fairbairn seems given to streaks. Not to mention his misses tend to come on the road, which may be an indictment on his composure. He&rsquo;s been absolutely perfect the last six games though (two of which were on the road), so he&rsquo;s on the right track.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give the Texans the benefit of the doubt here and say Fairbairn is reliable enough.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>No. No one defensive back on this team has stood out in my observations on this team.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>While a win over the Bills seems likely, their road to the playoffs will end with a tough loss to Baltimore.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Philadelphia Eagles</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Eagles have managed to win the NFC East after so much drama. Let&rsquo;s see if they can actually survive a game or two though. We&rsquo;ll evaluate them using the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes. It&rsquo;s been painful watching the Eagles this year, but these past few weeks have shown me Philadelphia has demonstrated enough resilience and grit to be considered mentally tough. It takes some fortitude to survive games the past two weeks while so many people on your roster are going down like flies. So I will give them kudos here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Jim Schwartz has always been one of the better defensive minds in the business. Nothing has changed this year to indicate otherwise. In fact, the team&rsquo;s success this year is more attributable to Schwartz than anybody else this year. Despite injuries wrecking his secondary for a bunch of games and his defensive line underperforming on a few occasions, Schwartz has kept his unit playing at a high level. Constant reorganizations were managed well throughout the season, as depth players were prepared to step up and play serviceably enough in relief duty.</p>

<p>Nothing better demonstrates Schwartz&rsquo;s aptitude than the way the defense played against the Cowboys in the division championship. Yes, Dak was injured somewhat, but the defensive backfield played very well in coverage, batting away balls and keeping the Cowboys receiving threats under wraps for the most part. It was a surprising showing from a unit many people assumed would be the weakest part of their defense. Schwartz deserves credit for training his defensive backs well.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately not. While the offensive line has plenty of playoff experience, Carson Wentz and a few of key skill players will be officially playing in their first playoff game. How quick Wentz will be able to calm his nerves will largely determine their final destination in the playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually the most difficult question to answer. Wentz has shown his mettle at times, leading at least five drives to outright win games or maintain leads. He should be credited for a game-winning drive against the Falcons as well, but his receiver dropped the ball at a crucial moment unfortunately.</p>

<p>Still, he&rsquo;s had a number of dull performances. This Eagles offense almost seemed rudderless at times with him at its helm. Even some games that he won were far more harrowing than they needed to be - some of those comebacks shouldn&rsquo;t have been needed in the first place. Injuries and bad coaching have played a role, but the quarterback has to assume some responsibility as well.  His negative expected completion rate isn&rsquo;t doing him any favors.</p>

<p>Because of these doubts, I can&rsquo;t classify him as an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>No. While the Eagles can coach up players, I question their play-calling their times. Their commitment to the ground game borders on obstinacy at times, though the rushing attack has won them two games.</p>

<p>What really worries me is that the Eagles possess far more talent on offense than so many other teams and yet I see too many drives stopped short. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me, especially with a capable quarterback like Carson Wentz at the helm of the offense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know. We have three eligible candidates here - <strong><em>Derek Barnett</em></strong>, <strong><em>Fletcher Cox</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Brandon Graham</em></strong>. Neither one have truly stood out consistently enough from my observations. In the key rematch against the Dallas Cowboys, neither of the three were able to mount much pressure, though Derek Barnett may have been playing hurt. Against the Giants in the last week of the regular season, all three had a moment, but I didn&rsquo;t see enough consistency.</p>

<p>Their numbers aren&rsquo;t very impressive as well, though it may be more a function</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s very likely to me that at least one of the three stands out during the postseason. And it&rsquo;s quite possible another of the group will rise up.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Eagles actually have five different vectors on offense.</p>

<p>The most important vectors are the tight ends - <strong><em>Zach Ertz</em></strong> and  <strong><em>Dallas Goedert</em></strong>. Both have the ability to run routes and make tough catches. And Carson Wentz seems to have an affinity for his tight ends, given his targeting numbers.</p>

<p>On the receiver end, we have <strong><em>Greg Ward</em></strong> as a surprise breakout star now that the offense can no longer count on the services of Alshon Jeffery nor DeSean Jackson. On the rushing end, <strong><em>Miles Sanders</em></strong> has done a fantastic job as a rookie tailback, working in concert with a solid offensive line. His ability to catch the balls out of the backfield also serves this team well.</p>

<p>One more vector here is <strong><em>Carson Wentz</em></strong>. Though his passing may be shaky at times, his ability to scramble can sustain drives when plays don&rsquo;t develop as expected.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>No. Jake Elliott has not been so clutch over the past several weeks, missing four field goals, three of which would have helped to end the game sooner in the Eagles favor.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Malcolm Jenkins definitely ranks as an elite player.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Eagles have their fair share of strengths and weaknesses. If Carson Wentz can play past his inexperience and connect well with his weapons on offense, a division round invitation is in order. And while the Eagles will not be the favorite up against the 49ers, I do believe they&rsquo;ll give San Francisco a run for their money.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Seattle Seahawks</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Seahawks are returning to the playoffs once again as a wild card team. Let&rsquo;s see if their fortunes will be better this year using my lovely little rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes. Once again returning to this idea that mental fortitude is primarily a function of the head coach, I&rsquo;d be remiss to doubt Pete Carroll and the attitude that he instills in his team.</p>

<p>Granted, the team has fallen short on a few occasions or even nearly coughed up the lead in other games, but the Hawks still have that resilience, probably best exemplified by their near-successful comeback against the 49ers in the season finale, despite being so utterly outplayed and out-coached.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, no. Even though Carroll once led the Legion of Boom early in the decade, his grasp on defensive concepts seems to have slipped over the years.</p>

<p>The Seahawks have coughed up nearly 6000 yards on defense this year. They&rsquo;ve won games sloppily against teams that ate up yardage against their defense. Matt Schaub managed to post 460 yards against their defense, albeit in a futile effort as the game was out of hand.</p>

<p>People can argue that Carroll&rsquo;s defenses are more than happy to give up yardage when the Seahawks are blowing out the other team on the scoreboard. Sure, but the Seahawks back in their Legion of Boom days were infamously stingy, even with big leads.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes. With the exception of a few rookies, most of the Seahawks have considerable playoff experience, including Russell Wilson.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes. Russell Wilson was in the conversation for MVP before Lamar Jackson really broke out as the favorite. Still, he&rsquo;s put in some remarkable performances, including a nearly legendary comeback against the 49ers that fell short due to bad coaching.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Once again, no. The offense can be unbearably flaccid at times and all too content playing some uninspiring football with the lead in hand. Brian Schottenheimer has done little to field an efficient and creative offense, despite having one of the best quarterbacks in the game heading his offense. Even in their pivotal game against the 49ers, the Seahawks were gutless on offense until the game was essentially forced into Russell Wilson&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>None. Jadaveon Clowney may be the one person on this team closest to being considered elite, but his boom-or-bust production over the course of the season only invalidates such a consideration - an elite pass rusher needs to rack up pressures and tackles and be <strong><em>consistent</em></strong> at it.</p>

<p>Nobody else even comes close.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Tyler Lockett</em></strong> and <strong><em>D.K. Metcalf</em></strong> are the only skill players that can be safely considered reliable vectors on offense, the former known for his speed and route-running ability while the latter is known more as a receiver that can make those contested catches outside the number. Chris Carson would have been on this list had his season not ended due to a hip injury.</p>

<p><strong><em>Russell Wilson</em></strong> can add himself to this list as well given his ability to run the ball, either off read-options or scrambles.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>No. Jason Myers has missed one too many kicks in critical moments for me to certify him as a reliable field goal kicker. Not to mention he&rsquo;s shanked a few extra point attempts.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>No. The Seahawks have one of the worst backfields in the league, as no one player has stood out from those ranks.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Seahawks have too many deficiencies to go far. With a little bit of luck, Seattle can advance to the division round and possibly lose a closer-than-expected race against the 49ers, but it seems more probable to me that the Hawks will be downed by their fellow birds of prey in the Eagles.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - New England Patriots</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Patriots are seeing Wild Card weekend for the first time in over ten years, shockingly. So let&rsquo;s examine their prospects using my trusty old rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>One would think so going solely off history. But in reality, this team shouldn&rsquo;t have lost the way it did against the Dolphins last week. It was an embarrassing loss against a double-digit underdog.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure anymore. The Patriots have lost three of their last five games. Two of those losses came back-to-back. The will to win is there, but the talent and execution is not. Brady, McDaniels, and Belichick have known about this team&rsquo;s offensive issues since the beginning of the season and yet, these three seem almost powerless to overcome them.</p>

<p>Still, mental toughness is usually a function of the head coach, and it&rsquo;s impossible for me to doubt Bill Belichick given his pedigree. So I&rsquo;ll give the Patriots the benefit of the doubt here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes, Bill Belichick is still one of the best at coaching defenses, let alone teams. His defense this year has been the gold standard at pass coverage.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>No doubt.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yet another question difficult to answer. Brady has underthrown quite a few passes this year. He&rsquo;s unable to develop much rapport with his young receiving corps. Some of the touch on his throws must be lost, as he&rsquo;s not really attempting tight-window throws anymore.</p>

<p>But the mind is still there. The raw football intelligence is still there. It&rsquo;s a quality that never truly leaves the greats, that genius level of knowledge about a particular subject that renders itself indelibly into the recesses of their minds.</p>

<p>Still&hellip;the very fact I have doubt here is enough for me to say no, Brady is no longer an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Josh McDaniels is one of the better offensive minds in the league today. The Patriots have made hay using scheming and trick plays to put points on the board. Were it not for these plays being so cleverly scripted into the flow of the game, New England&rsquo;s offense would be abysmal instead of just miserable.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Kyle Van Noy</em></strong> can definitely be considered an elite pass rusher, given his consistently solid play over the course of the season. While his pass rushing numbers aren&rsquo;t as gaudy as one would expect, we have to keep in mind that Belichick defenses typically ask a great deal more from their pass rushers - Kyle Van Noy saw quite a bit of coverage work throughout the season that took away some of his pass rushing opportunities.</p>

<p>And really, if Van Noy is on this list despite the lack of spectacular statistics, then one could make a very strong argument for <strong><em>Dont&rsquo;a Hightower</em></strong>.  Hightower was actually more productive on a per-rush basis, tallying up at least 13 quarterback hits despite rushing only half as often as Van Noy.</p>

<p>Somebody could make an argument for <strong><em>Jamie Collins</em></strong> as well, but I&rsquo;ll shy away from that as it&rsquo;s quite clear Bill prefers to use Collins far more in coverage than as an actual pass rusher.</p>

<p>Still, we have two confirmed elite pass rushers and one man that can play like a stud rusher depending on the game plan. The Patriots are in good shape here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>On the other hand, the Patriots are not in so good a shape here. <strong><em>Julian Edelman</em></strong> is clearly a vector given the trust Brady has vested in him, but Edelman&rsquo;s inclusion as a vector is only meaningful so long as he remains healthy <em>enough</em> over the course of the postseason. Injuries have hammered him repeatedly through the season and it seems as if things will be no different for the playoffs.</p>

<p><strong><em>James White</em></strong> is the only other player that I can confidently assert as a vector here, given his ability to catch balls out of the backfield.</p>

<p>I have a hard time considering <strong><em>Sony &ldquo;Playstation&rdquo; Michel</em></strong> and <strong><em>Rex Burkhead</em></strong> a vector here as the Patriots offensive line have been pretty flaccid in their run-blocking. Though it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Patriots have been so much better running the ball the past three weeks, so we can&rsquo;t completely rule out the ground game as a possible vector. More footage needs to be put on tape before I correct myself here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Surprisingly, yes. Despite their struggles over the season with field goals, it seems the Patriots finally found somebody that can kick them through the uprights consistently. Folk only missed three field goals all year, two in inclement weather and one that was blocked when the Patriots line broke down inside.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Stephon Gilmore. One could also include Devin McCourty with his five interceptions.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Patriots are not nearly as bad as the media narratives claim. Still, their limp offense will cost them dearly on the road in Kansas City.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Tennessee Titans</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>A resurgent Titans squad led by Ryan Tannehill has muscled their way into the playoffs. Let&rsquo;s look at their playoff prospects using the rubric outlined <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes, sufficiently so. After benching their franchise quarterback for a burn-out from Miami, one would be forgiven for thinking the Titans were done for the season. Instead, their fortunes swung upward - the team found renewed life with a quarterback that wasn&rsquo;t afraid to lob the ball into smaller, riskier windows.</p>

<p>Their goal-line stand against the Chargers in Tannehill&rsquo;s first game as a starter, their surprise wins over the Chiefs and Colts, their respectable performances even in defeat&hellip;all these things point to a team that&rsquo;s not short on resolve.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Hard to say, but I&rsquo;d lean towards no. I respect Mike Vrabel and Dean Pees and the work they&rsquo;ve done in their past stints. But it&rsquo;s clear that this Tennessee defense has holes at all three levels. Would things be worse or better if a set of certifiably pedestrian coaches were managing this defense? I can&rsquo;t answer for sure.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one example I can use that makes me doubt the minds behind this defense, it was their loose coverage of Michael Thomas a couple weeks ago when the Saints came into town. Being that Thomas is playing at an unreal level right now, one would think it&rsquo;d be wise to bracket him or pay extra attention to him when you execute zone blitzes against Drew Brees. The Titans did neither.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>A good number of the players on the offense have playoff experience, but unfortunately, the quarterback is missing postseason experience on his resume. Ryan Tannehill&rsquo;s first outing as a playoff quarterback will likely result in a few screw-ups.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes, actually. I dare say Tannehill is an elite quarterback. Maybe it&rsquo;s the air in Nashville or the moonshine from the Tennessee backwoods, but Tannehill has found new life under Mike Vrabel and his coaching staff. It&rsquo;s not just the fact that his completion percentage has soared past expectations more than anybody else in the league, according to Next Gen Stats. It&rsquo;s his toughness. I&rsquo;ve seen him get his ass kicked in the game against the Colts and yet, the man still stood in the pocket, making big-time throws.</p>

<p>His supporting cast has done their fair share to lift this team&rsquo;s fortunes, sure, but it wasn&rsquo;t until Ryan Tannehill was inserted into the lineup as a starter that the offense began realizing its full potential. And that&rsquo;s usually the hallmark of an elite quarterback - being able to lift the play of his fellow teammates by presence and aura alone.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Arthur Smith has molded this offense into one of the better units in the league. Ryan Tannehill certainly helps bolsters his case, but it&rsquo;s more the trick plays, the play-action scheming, and the scripting that justifies his consideration here as a chess player. Smith has a package of misdirection and up-tempo plays that he usually invokes towards the end of the game in order to seize victory away from the opponent. And these plays are remarkably effective as well, having actually won games for the Titans against serious competition.</p>

<p>One can argue that his religious devotion to the run is a bit foolish given that rushing is not nearly as valuable as passing in today&rsquo;s NFL. Still, when you have quite possibly the league&rsquo;s most productive rushing attack, it&rsquo;s hard to blame him for committing so much time and energy to the ground game.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>Arguably none. The only player worthy of consideration here is <strong><em>Harold Landry</em></strong>. Yet nowhere in my notes have I taken notice of Landry. His raw numbers are unimpressive as well compared to other players in the same position. If he is to be classified as an elite pass rusher, it would be more so off the back of his strong run defense. But that wouldn&rsquo;t make sense, because we&rsquo;re looking first and foremost at pass rushing prowess here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p><strong><em>AJ Brown</em></strong> and <strong><em>Derrick Henry</em></strong> deserve vector status, without question. The former will be the offensive rookie of the year and the latter is the rushing champion of the league.</p>

<p>Other than that, it is hard to find a third vector for this team. Jonnu Smith, Adam Humphries, Corey Davis, and Tajae Sharpe are all eligible candidates<strong><em>,</em></strong> but not one of them has really stood out among the rest. Jonnu Smith has the strongest case out of the group, given his yardage, his targets, and his position as a tight end.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Honestly, the team&rsquo;s been a mess this entire season when it comes to field goals. The Titans started a new kicker two weeks ago in Greg Joseph. It remains to be seen whether Joseph can actually deliver, as he hasn&rsquo;t attempted a single field goal this season. His record in Cleveland is all right though, so he holds some promise.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>I would lean no here. Kevin Byard is the only defensive back from that bunch giving me pause here.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>An elite quarterback and a good offensive mind aren&rsquo;t enough to win consistently in these playoffs, let alone against the best coached team in the league in the Patriots. I expect an early death for these Titans in the Wild Card round.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Buffalo Bills</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>The Buffalo Bills have fought their way into the playoffs for the second time under Sean McDermott. Now let&rsquo;s review them using the rubric defined <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes, the team is mentally tough. They&rsquo;ve done enough to demonstrate a will to fight, winning almost all the games they&rsquo;re supposed to win. Their defense has hung in there in arduous moments, defending leads against last-minute comeback attempts.</p>

<p>Even against tough opponents, the Bills have played well too. Baltimore and New England had to scratch and claw their way to wins over this Buffalo squad.</p>

<p>The only knock on this team and their defense is their halfhearted tackling. The Bills have some serious issues stopping players upon first contact.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes, the team does feature a great defensive mind in Sean McDermott. This team has lifted itself to the playoffs twice under McDermott thanks to the strength of their defense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately not. While most of the starters on offense have considerable playoff experience, this will be Josh Allen&rsquo;s first outing in the postseason. As a mediocre quarterback starting in the playoffs, things won&rsquo;t begin well for these Bills.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>No. I would even struggle to say they&rsquo;re led by a viable quarterback. In reality, these Bills are led by an athlete. While Allen can run like a gazelle, he can&rsquo;t throw with any sort of grace or touch.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>To be determined. Brian Daboll has gotten some productivity out of this offense thanks to his usage of short routes, power runs behind Devin Singletary, Josh Allen&rsquo;s mobility, and good usage of mid-level veterans like John Brown and Cole Beasley. But it&rsquo;s difficult separating the logic and philosophy driving this offense from Josh Allen&rsquo;s painful throws.</p>

<p>It seems that when this season started, the Bills were intent on having Josh Allen work with smaller receivers that could run more complicated routes. And it paid off. So if anything, that&rsquo;s an argument that demonstrates the intelligence of the coaching staff here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>At least one. I can count <strong><em>Shaq Lawson</em></strong> as an elite pass rusher here. Though not league-leading in any respect, the man still makes plays on a regular basis, even if the numbers don&rsquo;t necessarily vouch for his ability.</p>

<p><strong><em>Jerry Hughes</em></strong> is another possibility, given the Patriots seemed intent on doubling him at the line of scrimmage. But that might have been more circumstance than actual strategy on the part of New England.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Bills hit the magic number of 3 here. I can confirm <strong><em>John Brown</em></strong>, <strong><em>Devin Singletary</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Josh Allen</em></strong> as guaranteed vectors. John Brown is undoubtedly the team&rsquo;s best receiver and the receiver Josh Allen favors most, going by targets. With two yards per route run, Brown has validated the team&rsquo;s belief in him. Devin Singletary, meanwhile, has been a great halfback, posting over five yards on average rushing the ball. And Josh Allen is on this list given his mobility - while his passing is suspect, his athleticism and his long runs are truly an asset to this offense.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cole Beasley</em></strong> falls outside this bucket here given that his production hasn&rsquo;t quite cemented him as a cornerstone on this offense. He&rsquo;s come up big in spot moments, so it was a little difficult crossing his name off here, but production and dependence matters when assessing potential vectors.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>No. Stephen Hauschka has missed quite a few field goals this year from 50 yards and out. In fact, he missed two important field goals in the Bills 3-point loss to the Browns. A couple other missed field goals were attempted in end-half scenarios, creating doubts about whether he can be clutch should the Bills need a last-minute field goal to win.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Tre&rsquo; Davious White. One of the best cornerbacks in the game. Enough said.</p>

<p>Micah Hyde is another candidate here.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Bills have a number of deficiencies, most notably at quarterback and kicker. The lack of playoff experience will hurt Buffalo as well in their first match against the Texans.</p>

<p>Still, there&rsquo;s a possibility the Bills can pull off an upset against Houston in the Wild Card round. If so, their season will end in dismal fashion in Baltimore.</p>

	<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Minnesota Vikings</div>
	<div class='headerUnderline'></div>
	<div class='postBody'>
		
			<p>Using the rubric outlined <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>, it&rsquo;s time for us to start our review of postseason teams with the sixth seed of the NFC, the Minnesota Vikings!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>No. It&rsquo;s hard for me to say this too, as I always respected Mike Zimmer and the defenses that he trains up. His defenses are usually greater than the sum of their parts. But the offense is nowhere near as resilient as the defense. With the exception of the game against the Dallas Cowboys, the Vikings offense hasn&rsquo;t surpassed expectations, nor have they really mounted any successful comebacks against solid teams.</p>

<p>Minnesota had an opportunity to step up its game against the Packers two weeks ago, but the Vikings were even more flaccid on offense than the Packers. It was depressing to see the team fail to come through on such an important game.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes, he is. There&rsquo;s no doubt that Mike Zimmer has a solid understanding of good defense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes. Most of the starters on offense have some playoff experience. Even though Kirk Cousins only has one meaningful postseason game in his career, I&rsquo;ll give him the benefit of the doubt here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>No, even though Kirk Cousins has some gaudy numbers. Those numbers came more from a play-action bootleg concept that Kevin Stefanski and Gary Kubiak incorporated into the offense midway through the season. When Kirk Cousins is forced to drop back and play quarterback without any window dressing, the man tends to fall apart.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>To be determined. As I discussed earlier when explaining why Kirk Cousins is not an elite quarterback, offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski saw some remarkable success when he incorporated a bootleg concept in the offensive playbook, allowing Kirk Cousins to roll out to his left and air out some dimes.</p>

<p>The fact that this team has been pretty productive despite not having an elite quarterback usually stands as proof that the main offensive coaches are doing a great job here, but I wonder if the Vikings&rsquo; success comes more from talent and easy competition than it does from scheme. Not to mention Minnesota remains firmly committed to the outdated mentality of power running setting everything up.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p><em>Danielle Hunter (DE)</em></p>

<p>The only pass rusher I can wholeheartedly define as elite is <strong><em>Danielle Hunter</em></strong>. I&rsquo;ve seen him step up in big moments and he has the pressure numbers and tackle numbers to justify his inclusion. <strong><em>Everson Griffen</em></strong> has those numbers as well. But it&rsquo;s different. I have yet to see Griffin truly step up and make plays on a consistent basis. I&rsquo;ll list him here simply as a possible elite pass rusher.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>I can only confirm two vectors here - <strong><em>Dalvin Cook</em></strong> and <strong><em>Stefon Diggs</em></strong>. The former remains one of the best tailbacks in this league given his penchant for manufacturing yards despite some poor run blocking from his offensive lineman. Stefon Diggs remains one of the best receiving threats in the league, having posted 2.69 yards per route run, according to Pro Football Focus.</p>

<p>It seems unfair not to include <strong><em>Adam Thielan</em></strong> on this list, but his production has plummeted off a click the past several weeks. It remains to be seen whether his injuries continuing plaguing him in the postseason.</p>

<p>Nobody else really qualifies to be on this list, which is a little worrisome. Having only two reliable vectors can leave this offense short-changed against well-coached defenses.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Yes. Outside on one bad game early in the season, Dan Bailey has done well scoring field goals and extra points for his Vikings.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Yes, Harrison Smith has made a name for himself as one of the best swiss-knife safeties in this league.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>This team should be better given its roster. But an injury to a key receiver, a lack of resilience on the part of the offense, iffy offensive coaching, a pedestrian quarterback, and complete lack of home field advantage will doom this team in their first match against the Saints.</p>
