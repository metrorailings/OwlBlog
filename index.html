			<h2 id="titans-jaguars">Titans @ Jaguars</h2>

<p>The Jaguars insist on running a zone coverage scheme that forces their linebackers to run around the field and even blanket receivers at times. It&rsquo;s not good when Jacksonville has a slow bunch of linebackers outside of Myles Jack.</p>

<p>Jacksonville is still trying to build an offensive identity around Leonard Fournette instead of the passing game. The Titans are keying in on Fournette though, stalling the Jaguars anemic offense.</p>

<p>Mariota sucks.</p>

<p>The Titans will run that ball with reckless abandon until it works, dammit.</p>

<p>Minshew seems to like throwing his deep balls outside the numbers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ravens-chiefs">Ravens @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>The Chiefs are hopeless at rushing the passer. Chris Jones is the only quality pass rusher on that team. Frank Clark hasn&rsquo;t been living up to his billing.</p>

<p>Michael Lombardi may be right - this Ravens offense has a hard time recovering from negative plays.</p>

<p>Once again, horrendous clock management from Andy Reid as the first half winds down.</p>

<p>Gus Edwards has been beastly, breaking tackles and accelerating quickly.</p>

<p>Ravens offense adjusted in the second half by hammering the ball on the ground. First drive was nothing but runs. It&rsquo;s clear the Chiefs prioritized defending the pass here.</p>

<p>Chiefs should have covered. But two lucky heaves by Lamar Jackson kept the Ravens within one score. Goddammit. Ravens are a team with fight though.</p>

<p>Cameron Irving is a point of weakness along that Chiefs offensive line.</p>

<p>The Chiefs may have issues picking up delay and zone blitzes, similar to what I saw last year when Kansas City faced the Patriots before the Super Bowl.</p>

<p>Add overload blitzes to the short list of issues dragging these Chiefs down. Even against five and six-man fronts, the Chiefs offensive line tends to slide protection towards one direction, usually letting one defender come free from the opposite edge. Usually, Kansas counters this by dumping the ball off on the halfback leaking out of the backfield.</p>

<p>The Ravens won the battle in the trenches throughout the game with creative blitz concepts. Of the times that Mahomes was left with a clean pocket, I noticed that play-action and quarterback roll-outs were used on a few of those plays.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="lions-eagles">Lions @ Eagles</h2>

<p>Outside zone runs may be effective against Detroit&rsquo;s bigger, slower front.</p>

<p>Detroit runs quite a bit of 11 personnel for a team that&rsquo;s reputedly run-heavy.</p>

<p>Philly&rsquo;s secondary is lousy. Darby especially has lost some of his touch. Not good when the top cornerback on your roster fails to perform adequately.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="giants-buccaneers">Giants @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Daniel Jones can run with the ball. Offensive playbook even has designed runs for him.</p>

<p>Janoris Jenkins is not an elite corner.</p>

<p>In the second half, Giants defense has shifted to a two-safety look with man coverage underneath. It seems to be enough to keep Jameis from moving the ball on them at will.</p>

<p>Also worth noting - Jameis sucks. Buccaneers need to get rid of him. Maybe even trade up for Justin Herbert or whatever his name is.</p>

<p>Winston would be murdered by a team with a solid pass rush, the way he holds on to the ball. His pocket presence is horrendous.</p>

<p>Shaq Barrett something special. Buccaneers made a solid pick-up in free agency here.</p>

<p>Daniel Jones holds on to the ball like a damn fool too.</p>

<p>Buccaneers playing prevent defense on the Giants on the last drive was their downfall. Credit to Daniel Jones for picking apart their weak defensive scheme. And credit to the Giants for stunting the Buccaneers&rsquo; offense somehow. I need to review tape here&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-browns">Rams @ Browns</h2>

<p>Browns have serious issues guarding shifty receivers.</p>

<p>Cooper Kupp is the best receiver on the Rams.</p>

<p>Wade Phillips adjusted quickly on defense. Rams defense were embarrassed on a long third down when a blitz left them helpless to defend against a halfback screen. The second time the Browns tried to pull off the same trick, a linebacker shadowed the Browns tailback and took him down before the screen was even set.</p>

<p>Browns made a bizarre call on a fourth and long, calling a draw run. Just idiotic.</p>

<p>Goff&rsquo;s play clock management on the road is just poor. Waiting too long to call for the snap. Nearly cost the Rams a first down when McVay called a time-out immediately before the ball was snapped on what actually ended up being a successful throw to move the chains.</p>

<p>Baker Mayfield having to hold on to the ball and manufacture a play is not a pretty sight. Plays have to unfold like they&rsquo;re drawn up in order for the Browns signal caller to be successful.</p>

<p>The Browns lack any creative red zone plays to try and make an emergency touchdown.</p>

<p>Once again, the Browns&rsquo; lack of discipline at preventing penalties kept some Ram drives alive or more fruitful.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-chargers">Texans @ Chargers</h2>

<p>Texans secondary is still incredibly problematic. The off coverage in particular is worrying.</p>

<p>DJ Reader stepping up as a solid pass rusher.</p>

<p>Gus Bradley does not have much of a taste for blitzes, apparently. In fact, he may have more of a liking for three-man rushes than for blitzes, sadly.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="panthers-cardinals">Panthers @ Cardinals</h2>

<p>Kyler Murray being able to run off the read option seems to be an important part of the Cardinals offense.</p>

<p>Cardinals seem to be more prone to using wide receiver screens as part of their otherwise barebones red zone package.</p>

<p>Kyle Allen playing well, especially under pressure. Keeps his eyes down the field.</p>

<p>Carolina has a package of reverses in their offensive repertoire. One example is a two-layered wide receiver sweep.</p>

<p>Mario Addison with a timely sack to end a Cardinal drive.</p>

<p>Arizona is lousy at defending tight ends.</p>

<p>Kyle Allen&rsquo;s first two touchdowns came from traditional drop-back plays. Impressive.</p>

<p>Carolina&rsquo;s secondary is playing very well. Quite disciplined in their zone coverage.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="broncos-packers">Broncos @ Packers</h2>

<p>Broncos love their three-man rushes, for some stupid reason.</p>

<p>Flacco not showing any confidence by abandoning the pocket early on a critical third down.</p>

<p>Garrett Bolles could have cost the team a touchdown.</p>

			<h2 id="ravens-chiefs-6-5">Ravens @ <em>Chiefs</em> (-6.5)</h2>

<p>I initially sides with the Ravens here, especially as 7-point underdogs. But a bit more probing into this match-up and I uncovered a few things that worried me. One, Lamar Jackson is playing almost too well as a passer given his performance from last year. The man is due for regression soon, and what better place to regress than a stadium famed for exposing quarterbacks playing far above their pay grade. Two, the Ravens pass defense showed some vulnerabilities last week against the Cardinals and their Air Raid attack. It makes sense, given that great defenses one year almost always regress the following year. The Ravens defense this year was bound to lose some of its teeth, having lost major players at all levels of the defense to free agency or injury. And that makes things easier for Patrick Mahomes and all of his weapons. Speaking of which, it&rsquo;s also worth noting that this is the home opener for the Chiefs.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="raiders-vikings-8-5">Raiders @ <em>Vikings</em> (-8.5)</h2>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this a great game for the Vikings? Exactly one of those games where the Vikings make a statement following an embarrassing loss to a bitter rival. And the Raiders are the perfect team to crush into a pulp too, what with the team being bottom-tier league fodder. Too many things are going in the Vikings favor here, making Minnesota a tempting pick despite the high spread.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="steelers-49ers-6-5"><em>Steelers</em> @ 49ers (-6.5)</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little worrying to side with Pittsburgh here given that the 49ers are playing in their home opener here. It&rsquo;s all the more worrying when the Steelers are starting an untested quarterback while San Francisco is fielding an offense that just dropped 40 points the week before. But once again, I have faith in Mike Tomlin and his coaching staff will make some bold moves here to keep Pittsburgh competitive in this game.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Shanahan&rsquo;s offense can be stopped so long as defenders remain disciplined and their rushing game can be stunted. While the Steelers lost some of their composure late last week against the Seahawks, Pittsburgh still managed to keep things close.</p>

<p>Not to mention Pittsburgh does have an ace card here - the surprise factor involved when a new quarterback is thrusted into a starter role. Defensive coaches don&rsquo;t have much game footage on Mason Rudolph, so it&rsquo;ll be hard getting a beat on the young man&rsquo;s tendencies and habits.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="panthers-cardinals-3"><em>Panthers</em> @ Cardinals (-3)</h2>

<p>Like the Steelers, the Panthers are starting an untested quarterback on the road, albeit against a different NFC West club. Still, I feel better about this pick compared to the Pittsburgh pick, even though Carolina is only being given three points here.</p>

<p>The reality is that this Arizona team is still developing an identity on offense. Kliff Kingsbury is still feeling his way around as a rookie head coach, given all the mistakes he made last week against the Ravens.</p>

<p>The Panthers, on the other hand, are a desperate team still looking for their first victory of the season. I think that desperation is the extra juice they need to win this game outright. Not to mention the surprise factor involved whenever a team starts a new quarterback that doesn&rsquo;t have much footage out there that can be studied.</p>

<p>One thing worth noting before I close this out&hellip;Kawann Short is questionable. As the best pass rusher on the team, Short is absolutely critical here to the Panthers&rsquo; chances of winning this game. Carolina&rsquo;s secondary is nowhere near competent enough to keep the Cardinals&rsquo; air raid under control. The Panthers need to harass Kyler Murray on a regular basis if they want to cap Arizona&rsquo;s offense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-browns-3"><em>Rams</em> @ Browns (+3)</h2>

<p>Against my own personal inclination to see the Browns win a major primetime game here, give me the more cohesive team here with the better coaches and the experience of having played so many spotlight games over the past couple years. Jared Goff&rsquo;s pedestrian quarterbacking gives me some pause here, but it&rsquo;s not like Baker Mayfield has been lighting the world on fire this season. Not to mention losing a major weapon like David Njoku will hurt this offense - it robs them of a vector on offense.</p>

			<h2 id="bills-giants">Bills @ Giants</h2>

<p>The Bills&rsquo; man coverage is real.</p>

<p>The Giants&rsquo; man coverage is lame though. DeAndre Baker is a particular point of weakness.</p>

<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for some early runs from Saquon Barkley and slant routes, the Giants offense would have been complete rudderless.</p>

<p>Josh Allen is committing to staying in the pocket. Though it&rsquo;s easy to do so considering New York&rsquo;s gutless pass rush.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="49ers-bengals">49ers @ Bengals</h2>

<p>Kwan Alexander is quite passionate and embraces the leadership role he&rsquo;s been given on defense.</p>

<p>The Bengals are looking hopeless at defending against teams that are good at running the ball. Outside runs in particular bewilder Cincinnati&rsquo;s defense.</p>

<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s misdirection on play-action resulting in big plays.</p>

<p>Lack of creativity by the Bengals offense. Was the game plan here really to simply drop Andy Dalton back five or seven paces behind his offensive line and have him sling the ball to his receivers, with an occasional run by Joe Mixon?</p>

<p>Cincinnati&rsquo;s defense is a mess in coverage and run defense.</p>

<p>Playing from behind leaves the Cincinnati offense in a bit of a precarious situation, given their offensive line kinda sucks in pass protection</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chargers-lions">Chargers @ Lions</h2>

<p>Chargers run defense still remains suspect despite Thomas Davis now patrolling the middle of the field as the team&rsquo;s lead linebacker.</p>

<p>Austin Ekeler is a beast.</p>

<p>The Chargers run solid screens with Ekeler. Two big screens mostly negated due to iffy penalties, sadly.  Craif Wrolstad and his referees are a litigious bunch.</p>

<p>The replacement place kicker is truly terrible. The Chargers <strong>desperately</strong> need their primary field goal kicker back in action.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="seahawks-steelers">Seahawks @ Steelers</h2>

<p>Donte Moncrief is a liability at receiver, dropping passes and even bouncing them towards opposing defensive backs on one occasion.</p>

<p>Steelers defense can be picked apart. Their zone blitzing naturally leaves them vulnerable at certain spots along their defense. And their zone coverage can be exploited by capable tight ends.</p>

<p>Mason Rudolph can run if need be.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-ravens">Cardinals @ Ravens</h2>

<p>Lamar shows a preference for throwing to tight-ends and receivers running slants across the middle of the field.</p>

<p>I really do think Lamar is fond of his tight-ends. The Ravens need to load their roster with quality tight-ends.</p>

<p>Christian Kirk is a gamer.</p>

<p>Good man coverage across the board can really limit the Cardinals and their air raid.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="eagles-falcons">Eagles @ Falcons</h2>

<p>Isaac Seumalo is a point of weakness along the Eagles offensive line.</p>

<p>Grady Jarrett is a beast. Easily the best pass rusher on Atlanta&rsquo;s defensive line.</p>

<p>Creative blitzes by Jim Schwartz is throwing Matt Ryan off his game and keeping the Eagles alive in this game. Worth noting that these blitzes usually  mandate man coverage with no safety patrolling the deep field.</p>

<p>Carson Wentz playing sensationally despite not having either Desean Jackson or Alshon Jeffery on offense.</p>

<p>Calvin Ridley is undoubtedly the Falcons&rsquo; second receiver.</p>

<p>Considering the injury circumstances and the emotional edge in this game going to the Falcons, the Eagles were the better team here.</p>

			<h4 id="49ers-bengals-2-0">49ers @ <em>Bengals</em> (-2.0)</h4>

<p>Kind of weird for me to go with a team that I ranked as a dreg-tier team before the season. But Cincinnati truly impressed me last week, going up to the Clink to face off against a Seattle defense that prepped well for a McVay-style offense. Instead, the Bengals offense seems to have developed its own identity, one that suits Andy Dalton from what I saw last week. The Bengals are a far better team than I thought them to be - to my chagrin, coach Zac Taylor seems to know what he’s doing. I expect them to punk this underperforming 49ers team.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> And the Bengals were listed as a dreg-tier team for a reason. Cincinnati&rsquo;s defense was utterly hopeless against Shanahan&rsquo;s offense. This game made obvious that these Bengals are <em>terrible</em> defensing against the run.</p>

<h4 id="colts-titans-3"><em>Colts</em> @ Titans (-3)</h4>

<p>I don’t think all that much of the Titans smacking around the Browns last week. What concerns me about Tennessee here is that Derrick Henry is the focal point of their offense, instead of Marcus Mariota. It tells me quite a bit about what the coaches think of their young signal caller. In contrast, the Colts look as if they’re comfortable with Jacoby Brissett under center. I think Frank Reich’s dominance of these Titans will not be stopped in this game.</p>

<h4 id="seahawks-steelers-4">Seahawks @ <em>Steelers</em> (-4)</h4>

<p>It’s hard for me to initially side with these Steelers after their dismal showing last week against the Patriots. But the Seahawks weren’t that much better in their own game against the Bengals. It still looks to me that Seattle is still developing an identity on offense that maximizes the contributions of their noteworthy skill players. And they’re taking their sweet time figuring things out too unfortunately. Given Pittsburgh’s history of turning things around fairly quickly, I expect the Steelers offense to see more success here than Seattle’s. Playing on their home turf will also help Pittsburgh settle into a groove quicker.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem</em></strong>: Roethlisberger being knocked out of the game with an elbow injury sort of threw a wrench into the Steelers&rsquo; game plan, to say the least. Still, Mason Rudolph served admirably as an emergency quarterback. It wasn&rsquo;t enough though - Russell Wilson managed to score on four separate drives. This Pittsburgh defense has a real issue guarding tight ends running seam routes.</p>

<h4 id="bears-broncos-2-5">Bears @ <em>Broncos</em> (+2.5)</h4>

<p>Nobody should know Mitch Trubisky’s little quirks and tendencies better than the defensive coordinator that sparred with him in practice for the last two years. Combine that with the thin air of Mile High Stadium and the Bears offense should put forth another hopeless performance this season. So long as Flacco keeps his incontinence under control on a few drives, Denver can put up just enough points to steal a win here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> The Broncos <em>barely</em> covered. Joe Flacco is a terrible quarterback. It&rsquo;s so difficult to trust this Denver team outside of Mile High Stadium.</p>

<h4 id="saints-rams-2-5"><em>Saints</em> @ Rams (-2.5)</h4>

<p>The Rams played terribly last week. Makes me wonder if the last Super Bowl actually exposed their weaknesses to the rest of the league. Either way, the team still has one of the best coaches in the league in Sean McVay. But I would argue the Saints have a better coach in Sean Payton. That, the revenge angle, and the fact that Drew Brees is much better than Jared Goff has me siding with the Saints. Taking the points is nice too.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> Drew Brees sustaining a serious thumb injury on his throwing hand ruined any chances the Saints had of covering this game.</p>

			<h2 id="chiefs-jaguars">Chiefs @ Jaguars</h2>

<p>The one team unable to handle the humidity in Jacksonville today were&hellip;the Jaguars. How? It seemed like the Kansas City players were having a merry old time playing out there in the searing heat while the Jaguars defenders were looking exhausted by the second quarter. How the hell is this even possible? Did these Jaguars never once practice outside during training camp? I just don&rsquo;t get it. But it&rsquo;s clear the humidity did kill any hope these Jaguars had at keeping the game close. Too many Jaguar defenders were whiffing on tackles and slow to react to the Chiefs and their offensive trickery. Not to mention all the penalties the team racked up over the course of the game.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, Myles Jack being ejected for throwing a punch doesn&rsquo;t sit well with me. The season&rsquo;s started and you already have a leader on this team causing unnecessary drama over something as menial as a push. Makes me wonder whether this team really learned its lesson from last year when the entire defense collectively lost its religion several weeks into the season.</p>

<p>Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye were giving up more receptions than stopping them. Not a good thing when your elite defensive backs are themselves making the case to no longer be considered elite.</p>

<p>Sammy Watkins shined today, especially in Tyreek Hill&rsquo;s absence.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="giants-cowboys">Giants @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>Kellen Moore as offensive coordinator has been allowed to weave more creativity into the playbook, particularly when it comes to play-action concepts. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see whether the Cowboys can continue executing on these concepts as the season goes on.</p>

<p>The Giants will likely have one of the worst defenses in the league. The secondary in particular played rough today - blown assignments and naïveté summed up their day (more or less). It also didn&rsquo;t help that the Giants were generating virtually zero pressure with their defensive front alone. Lorenzo Carter and Markus Golden were not able to win inside the trenches today. Blitzes were the only way Bettcher was able to pressure Dak from time to time. Unfortunately, blitzes only further exposed a defensive backfield playing out of its depth.</p>

<p>Eli Manning played far better than I expected, even connecting on a few big passes. I guess a better offensive line can go a long way towards helping a quarterback rebuild his confidence. Or maybe it&rsquo;s the fire that&rsquo;s lit under his ass knowing that his heir apparent stands on the sidelines waiting for his name to be called&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="steelers-patriots">Steelers @ Patriots</h2>

<p>It looks like Pittsburgh will really end up missing the services of Antonio Brown. None of the other wide receivers seem to be stepping up outside of Juju Smith-Schuster to make up for the former Steeler&rsquo;s missed presence on the field.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh is still a bit slow at the linebacker position. New England is making a point of attacking these linebackers by running their halfbacks out of the backfield on routes.</p>

<p>The Patriots are truly a brilliant team. The quickness with which they can adjust on offense as opposing defense starts to adjust wows me. And that defensive line plays far better than the sum of its parts. It amazes me to see New England occasionally pressure the quarterback rushing only three defensive linemen. Generally, three-man rushes are doomed to fail.</p>

<p>New England will be goddamn scary on offense if they can work Josh Gordon and Antonio Brown into plays together.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bengals-seahawks">Bengals @ Seahawks</h2>

<p>The Bengals are impressing me here. It&rsquo;s clear to me that Cincinnati is the better team. All the more remarkable too considering the team doesn&rsquo;t have many new faces on their roster. The new coaches have done some fantastic work breathing new life into a team many considered one of the worst franchises in professional football last year.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I&rsquo;m also impressed at the way Zac Taylor keeps himself composed standing on the sidelines. Never overly emotional, nor does he look out of his depth. Likewise, his defensive coordinator shares the same stoic demeanor.</p>

<p>Andy Dalton looks far more comfortable in this offense, given the quickness of his passes and his overall composure in the pocket.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="49ers-buccaneers">49ers @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Tampa Bay cannot rely on either Demar Dotson or Donovan Smith as starting tackles. Especially because Winston tends to flinch every time an opposing pass rusher breathes on him. Unless Jameis manages to find inner peace real soon as the pocket crumbles around him, it&rsquo;s going to be a long season for this Buccaneers offense. I&rsquo;m beginning to doubt whether Bruce Arians can turn Winston into a capable quarterback.</p>

<p>So far, the 49ers biggest additions to the defensive line have not disappointed. Dee Ford and Nick Bosa have been consistently winning their battles at the line of scrimmage. It helps that lining up in wide-nine stances forces Tampa Bay&rsquo;s tight ends to match up with them in pass protection sometimes, though I wonder if the Bucs&rsquo; tight ends are honestly that much worser than the Bucs&rsquo; tackles at holding back against edge rushers.</p>

<p>The 49ers pass coverage still remains problematic. Nothing better exemplifies this than the defense giving up 18 yards on a 3rd and 17 <em>while playing sticks coverage</em>. If San Francisco is to be effective on defense, then the defensive line will clearly be leading the way. Though the line&rsquo;s rushing defense is suspect as well, given the smaller size of the front.</p>

<p>Penalties ruled the day here. Alex Kemp and his coaching staff are a litigious bunch. Something worth keeping in mind for future bets.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-saints">Texans @ Saints</h2>

<p>Texans seem to prefer fielding two tight ends at once on offense.</p>

<p>More interesting though, Deshaun Watson turns his back when selling play-action. Opposing defenses can send cornerback blitzes to throw him off as soon as he turns back around. The Saints have done that successfully on a number of occasions.</p>

<p>The Saints clock management towards the end of the game was simply phenomenal. With only thirty or so seconds left, the Saints were able to matriculate the ball down the field for a game-winning field goal. The last time-out wasn&rsquo;t even burned until after the very last offensive play, giving the Saints the flexibility to throw the ball down the middle of the field if need be. The receivers were trained well too, going down quickly after catches in order to conserve as much time as possible.</p>

<p>Deandre Hopkins is a beast. Deshaun Watson is fantastic with the big throws. And the Texans seem to have gotten better with some of their offensive play-calling, even fooling the Saints defense on occasion with misdirection plays.</p>

<p>Alvin Kamara is simply irreplaceable.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-browns">Titans @ Browns</h2>

<p>The Browns are out of control. So many unnecessary penalties holding them back&hellip;</p>

<p>The Titans, on the other hand, are well-composed and play some sound (albeit boring) football. It seems as if the coaches trust Derrick Henry more than they trust Marcus Mariota.</p>

<p>Tennessee does have issues along the offensive line, as the Browns defensive front were constantly winning their battles in the trenches.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, Cleveland too has a major issue on their offensive line - their right tackle Hubbard. Just going by this game alone, I can tell Cleveland&rsquo;s tackles won&rsquo;t be doing Baker any favors this season.</p>

<p>Baker Mayfield made some good throws, though. The second-year passer still has some ways to go when it comes to decision-making and reading opposing defenses. Mayfield still needs more time leveling up.</p>

			<h2 id="tier-6"><strong><em>Tier 6</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Jimmy Garoffalo</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>George Kittle (TE), Kyle Juszczyk (FB), Tevin Coleman (RB), Marquise Goodwin (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Jordan Matthews (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>DeForest Buckner (DT), Dee Ford (DE), Nick Bosa (DE), Kwon Alexander (LB), Richard Sherman (CB), Jason Verrett (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>John Lynch (GM), Kyle Shanahan (HC/OC), Robert Saleh (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 8</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, we see a bit of organization and the hiring of even more coaches. Mike LaFleur is no longer the wide receivers coach, though he will remain in his other role as the passing game coordinator. Instead, former star receiver Wes Welker now takes over as the wide receivers coach. Furthermore, a new quarterbacks coach has been hired now that the old one has gone to Denver to serve as their offensive coordinator. Lastly, we see a little shake-up among the offensive assistants, with two of the assistants being released and three new ones being hired this year.</p>

<p>On defense, we see two major changes. The first comes in the backfield, with Joe Woods now taking over as the team’s main secondaries coach and defensive passing game coordinator. The second and more important change comes along that defensive front - a new coach will now be overseeing that group after the old one was fired for fielding a unit that failed to rush the passer effectively.</p>

<hr />

<p>After Jimmy Garoffalo’s untimely ACL tear early in the season, it didn’t take long for the 49ers to quickly spiral downward. Their lack of depth didn’t do the back-up quarterbacks any favors as well.</p>

<p>The team’s prospects this season are a little better, so long as the injury bug doesn’t expose their lack of depth and leaves them crippled at quarterback yet again. The team found a sound complement to Marquise Goodwin in George Kettle. The newly-signed Tevin Coleman should be ready to contribute as well, being familiar with Kyle Shanahan and his system from their time together in Atlanta. Furthermore, the defensive line looks more promising this year, now that Dee Ford and Nick Bosa will be lining up alongside DeForest Buckner. Then again, it’s possible neither of the two additions will pan out - Dee Ford has only posted one solid year so far in his professional career and Nick Bosa is as injury-prone as his older brother. In fact, Bosa is already questionable for the first week. So it’s very possible the 49ers will find themselves saddled with a hopeless pass rush yet again. And that doesn’t bode well for a defensive unit that failed as a whole last year. Though maybe the addition of Kwon Alexander to the linebacking corps could help the back seven limber up - after all, cover-3 defensive shells pretty much mandate a capable middle linebacker in order to see any sustained success. His time in Tampa ended in mixed reviews though, so it remains to be seen whether Alexander can truly deliver.</p>

<p>It’s hard to pin this team’s fortunes this year. Much of their success will depend on the health of key players (most of whom I’ve discussed in the prior paragraph). And even still, the question I posed last year still very much applies this year - will Jimmy Garoffalo be able to step up this season now that the other teams in the league are fully aware of his potential as a starting-caliber quarterback? While his limited play time last year doesn’t offer up much insight about his future prospects, it’s worth noting the young man underwhelmed in the two games he was able to play out. If I was forced to take a side here, I’d go with this team posting a losing record this season.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Kyler Murray</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Christian Kirk (WR), David Johnson (RB), Kyler Murray (Mobile QB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Larry Fitzgerald (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Chandler Jones (DE), Terrell Suggs (OLB), Jordan Hicks (ILB), Patrick Peterson (CB), Budda Baker (S)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Steve Keim (GM), Kliff Kingsbury (New HC), Tom Clements (New OC), Vance Joseph (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>With the exception of a few assistant coaches, the entire coaching staff has been flipped from the top-down.</p>

<hr />

<p>Last year’s experiment failed dismally. This year’s experiment is likely to go down that same track.</p>

<p>Kliff Kingsbury is bringing with him a style of football known as the Air Raid offense. In this system, the pass game is dramatically emphasized, often with 10 personnel sets. Generally, rushing plays are only invoked with audibles. (Often undersized) offensive linemen are spaced farther apart from one another on the line of scrimmage in order to give the passer a bit more time to air the ball out.</p>

<p>Passing plays will (more or less) fall within one of two categories - the verticals play and the mesh play. In a verticals play, four skill players spread out and run deeper routes. One player may break his route early and cut inside towards the middle of the field to create an outlet should the passer be under duress. In a mesh play, the receivers run crossing routes designed to rub coverage defenders off of them.</p>

<p>So the big question here is whether the Cardinals will eventually see success this year following this style of football. I’m not too sure. It’ll take time for a wholly new coaching staff to teach an offensive philosophy that has not been fully embraced in the NFL. On top of that, Kyler Murray is an undersized quarterback playing behind the league’s shakiest offensive line. Things don’t bode well for the rookie unless he’s able to make magic with his legs.</p>

<p>Then again, Chip Kelly was able to find success pretty quickly after bringing his style of football to the Eagles. It took defenses quite a bit of time to finally catch up and counter the high tempo of his playcalling, even though people were long aware of his approach to football before his name was even considered for a head coaching position. And that’s a reality we must heed when it comes to defensive football - defenses can only react to new offensive trends. It’s why innovations in offense tend to go through some sort of honeymoon period in which they seem unstoppable. The Eagles under Chip Kelly, the Rams of the last two years, the Panthers and their exotic rushes three years ago&hellip;all these new-school offenses took the world by storm for a season or two before flushing out. So Kingsbury and his Air Raid offense <strong>could</strong> follow the same trajectory as well.</p>

<p>But then one would have to ask if the Air Raid is really that radical a concept in today’s NFL? After all, it’s obvious the league has been emphasizing the passing game more and more over the last several years. Offenses regularly send four skill players out on routes during pass plays. It could be argued that defenses have been adjusting to this trend for the better part of the decade. The Air Raid philosophy simply raises this emphasis on the air game at the expense of the rushing attack. So one would think defenses would be able to react quick here. Then again, the Rams are effectively running a tweaked version of the Shanahan system and it still took two seasons for defenses to properly catch up….</p>

			<h2 id="tier-3"><strong><em>Tier 3</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Jared Goff</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Todd Gurley (RB), Robert Woods (WR), Cooper Kupp (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Brandin Cooks (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Aaron Donald (DT)</em>, <em>Clay Matthews (DE), Marcus Peters (CB), Aqib Talib (CB), Eric Weddle (FS), Taylor Rapp (SS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Les Snead (GM), Sean McVay (HC/OC), Wade Phillips (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 10.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Zac Taylor, last year’s quarterbacks coach, left to become head coach of the Bengals,. However, with a little bit of reorganization, his role has been taken up by the passing game coordinator from last year. Furthermore, the team added Wes Phillips as the tight ends coach this time around. Not a bad move considering Wes and Sean McVay have some history working together back in Washington and the tight end unit was a point of weakness last year. Aside from those two changes, the offensive coaching staff remains intact.</p>

<p>On defense, the defensive line now has a new coach overseeing the unit. Yet another good move by the team considering the pass rush was another point of weakness last year, despite headlining the defensive player of the year in Aaron Donald. If the Rams had a truly dominant pass rush, the city of Los Angeles would be basking in the glow of their second Lombardi Trophy right now. Whether the new defensive line coach could turn things around remains to be seen, though it’s worth noting that the man has some good experience working with solid edge rushers during his tenure with the Chargers.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Rams were a hot team last year, fighting their way all the way to the Super Bowl only to lose embarrassingly to the Patriots. The team performed remarkably well relative to my expectations - I was convinced the rest of the league would crack their offensive scheme sooner rather than later, effectively neutralizing most of their potential on offense. It wasn’t until the end of the season that opposing teams finally gained a beat on their offense, thanks in large part to Matt Patricia.</p>

<p>Even still&hellip;the Rams are not an easy team to stop so long as they remain fully healthy. Todd Gurley and Cooper Kupp were clearly missed last year - both players do far more on offense than any of the other skill players. Gurley is the lynchpin behind the rushing attack and the short passing game. Kupp is the team’s most critical receiver, period. Without those two players, the Rams were still able to move the ball down the field, but it lacked that crisp quality that really took the league by storm earlier in the year. For this team to keep winning with their current offensive identity, they need some more luck on the injury front.</p>

<p>But then again, the real question we should be asking here is whether Jared Goff can actually take that step forward and stake himself as a truly elite quarterback. Despite his flashy numbers from last season, his success was more a result of fantastic scheming rather than transcendent talent. All things said, Goff ranks as an average quarterback in my eyes. But it’s only his fourth season - there’s still room for him to grow and better himself. So can he do that? Intuition tells me no, but my hunches about this team last year were pretty badly off. So let’s see…</p>

<p>One more thing worth talking about is the defense. By swapping out LaMarcus Joyner with Eric Weddle and Ndamukong Suh with Clay Matthews, the team seems intent on wising up their defense with veteran athletes. If Aqib Talib, Marcus Peters, Eric Weddle, and first-round rookie Taylor Rapp could all excel at press coverage, that would afford Wade Phillips the liberty to blitz more players against opposing quarterbacks. And that&rsquo;s a style of defense that suits Wade just fine. So expect this defense to surge a bit this year, probably as the offense regresses. The extent to which the defense improves and the offense slows down will determine whether the Rams can hold on to the division crown.</p>
