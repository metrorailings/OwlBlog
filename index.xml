      <description>My favorite holiday of the year. Not because of the turkey or the food or anything, fuck that. It&amp;rsquo;s all about having the day off to make bets on three consecutive primetime football games.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look through each game and find some bets to like. I feel good about these slate of games too.
Chicago Bears @ Detroit Lions (+2.5) (Point Total: 43.5) The spread cleared below the key number of 3 earlier today as word finally got around that Mitch Trubisky was highly unlikely to play.</description>

      <title>Reviewing Atlanta&#39;s Loss Against the Cowboys</title>

      <description>To nudge myself out of the funk I was in Sunday night, when I barely missed hitting a lucrative five-team parlay (may the gods smite Kirk Cousins for the rest of his life), I decided to review game tape from the Falcons loss to the Cowboys earlier in the day.
Two major takeaways&amp;hellip;
 Matt Ryan found himself flustered by Dallas&amp;rsquo; pass rush, especially when they blitzed. His worst throws of the day came against blitzes.</description>

      <title>Week 11 - Risky Propositions</title>

      <description>In this series, I&amp;rsquo;ll details bets that are a little risky for my blood.
Panthers @ Lions Such a beautiful spot for the Lions here. Coming off three embarrassing losses, Detroit is primed to play better now that they&amp;rsquo;ve returned back home and their season is on the line. And last week&amp;rsquo;s game against Chicago shows me that the team can defend against the run when it&amp;rsquo;s a central focus of their defensive game plan.</description>

      <title>Week 11 Best Bets</title>

      <description>All right, so the Supercontest is a lost cause. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;m treading water at exactly 50%. Statistically, I&amp;rsquo;m no better than a coin. A fucking coin.
But at the very least, each season offers up lessons for me to internalize. I like to believe I improve as a bettor every year. To be honest though, my best year as a sports gambler has been the first year I&amp;rsquo;ve actually started wagering serious money.</description>

      <title>Week 10 Bets</title>

      <description>Good week last week from a betting perspective, even if two of my Supercontest picks were losers. A superteaser hit landed me a pretty penny. Anyway&amp;hellip;
Saints (-6) @ Bengals Give me the Saints all day long.
The Bengals biggest problem on offense has always been that they lack reliable weapons that have won over the trust of their quarterback, Andy Dalton. And now you tell me his most trusted receiver in AJ Green is out?</description>

      <title>Bucs @ Panthers - Some Quick Game Analysis</title>
      <link>https://www.owlpicks.com/posts/bucs-panthers-some-quick-game-analysis/</link>

      <guid>https://www.owlpicks.com/posts/bucs-panthers-some-quick-game-analysis/</guid>
      <description>Just some real quick analysis&amp;hellip;.
The Panthers played phenomenal here, much to my surprise. And yet, a part of me still has questions of whether the Panthers are actually a legitimate playoff threat.
Their success in the last game was predicated on two things - devilishly creative play-calling and an eagerness to blitz against an offense that has absolutely no ability to read an incoming blitz.
Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? Well, let me show you a few plays that stood out to me.</description>

      <description>Packers (+5) @ Patriots Listen, it&amp;rsquo;s always risky betting against the Patriots, but their defense is a little too tepid for my liking. The Packers will cover so long as Bill Belichick&amp;rsquo;s defense fail to keep Aaron Rodger&amp;rsquo;s receivers bottled up under man coverage. As I keep saying, the Packers can be routed so long as you have a defensive secondary that can hold up well in man-to-man defense. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have such a secondary, expect Rodgers to run up some scores on you.</description>

      <description>My best bets of the week. Last week, I went 2-3. Two of those three losses came courtesy of the Chiefs and Rams failing to cover their spreads. BAH! I would not consider either of those picks to be terrible&amp;hellip;but it is pretty clear neither team deserved to cover their respective spreads last week. And this week, I will be rooting against one of them to flat out lose.</description>

      <description>My Supercontest picks sucked this week.
Not really too interested in dwelling too much on why my selections didn&amp;rsquo;t pan out, although I do want to give a bit of a breakdown of the Kansas City/Denver game.
As I expected, Kansas City would post at least 30 points. But what took me by surprise was Case Keenum. Arrowhead Stadium is usually the place where bad quarterbacks go to finally die. Just look at Blake Bortles and his downfall following his poor showing in Arrowhead earlier in the season.</description>
