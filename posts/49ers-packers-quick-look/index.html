		<div class='postTitle'>49ers @ Packers - Quick Analysis</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'><p>Here&rsquo;s the story of how I lost a couple units betting on what I thought would be <em>easy money</em>. As degenerate gamblers like myself learn time and time and time again&hellip;the NFL does not provide many opportunities for <em>easy money</em>.</p>

<p>To be fair, it was a solid game, considering people were expecting a slow-developing blowout. Through the first half, the 49ers actually managed to scrounge up a total of 24 points - a complete shocker considering the books had their <strong>final</strong> score set around 17 points. As the second half began, I saw the live line for their total score was actually set at 32.5 points. Three minutes into the third quarter, the total shifted 1 point downward (to 31.5) as the Packers managed to cap a drive with a field goal.</p>

<p>Think about that&hellip;31.5 points? Only 31.5 points?!? The 49ers already posted 24 points on the board. All they needed was a single touchdown and a lousy field goal to soar past that total. The Niners should be able to round up those points easily given the way they were chewing off yardage in the first half. Even if the Packers defense adjusted a little in the second half, the 49ers should still be able to motor along and collect three field goals over 25-ish minutes of playtime. Seemed like a solid bet, so long as the 49ers carried over their fantastic and aggressive playcalling from the first half.</p>

<p><em>Except they didn&rsquo;t.</em></p>

<p>Just look at the table below - it displays the run/pass split for each of San Francisco&rsquo;s 11 drives.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Week 6 - 49ers Drive Analysis.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The problem might not look all too obvious at first, but some additional context is needed. Look at the extended drives - those drives that feature more than five offensive plays. In the first half, the 49ers only sustained two such drives - the 1st and 6th drives. Notice the run/pass splits are fairly even between both drives. In the second half, the 49ers once again managed only two extended drives - the 7th and 8th drives. The 7th drive was another series where runs and passes were evenly called. Now the 8th drive&hellip;.the 8th drive is the reason why the 49ers lost the game.</p>

<p>Notice that the 49ers committed themselves wholly to the run on that 8th drive? CJ Beathard was called upon to throw the ball only twice through that entire series. It seemed like the 49ers were simply content trying to run the ball the rest of the way and escape Green Bay with a victory. Not necessarily a bad strategy when the end of the game is fast approaching and a team is in the lead. But this drive started <em>at the end of the third quarter.</em> Green Bay still had an entire quarter to stage a comeback&hellip;in a pivotal game that determined the fate of their season. And yet, despite this context&hellip;Kyle Shanahan was all too content running clock before the final quarter even started.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, after that drive, things went awry for San Francisco. CJ Beathard lost all the rhythm he developed from the first eight drives of the game. Come time to try and finally seal a road victory against the Packers, Beathard lost his mojo and collapsed under the pressure. As a result, the last three 49er drives ended in three-and-outs. Not surprisingly, the Packers were able to pull off a comeback with a Mason Crosby field goal that was set up thanks to some fantastic quarterbacking from Aaron Rodgers.</p>

<p>I guess the lesson here is to not trust Kyle Shanahan to keep a lead, at least not when his quarterback is CJ Beathard. Either Shanahan does not fully trust Beathard enough to sustain a lead or the man is simply still trying to hone his game management skills in his second year as a head coach.</p>
