		<div class='postTitle'>49ers @ Packers - Quick Analysis</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'><p>Here&rsquo;s the story of how I lost a couple units betting on what I thought would be <em>easy money</em>. As degenerate gamblers like myself learn time and time and time again&hellip;the NFL does not provide many opportunities for <em>easy money</em>.</p>

<p>To be fair, it was a solid game, considering people were expecting a slow-developing blowout. Through the first half, the 49ers actually managed to scrounge up a total of 24 points - a complete shocker considering the books had their <strong>final</strong> score set around 17 points. As the second half began, I saw the live line for their total score was actually set at 32.5 points. Three minutes into the third quarter, the total shifted 1 point downward (to 31.5) as the Packers managed to cap a drive with a field goal.</p>

<p>Think about that&hellip;31.5 points? Only 31.5 points?!? The 49ers already posted 24 points on the board. All they needed was a single touchdown and a lousy field goal to soar past that total. The Niners should be able to round up those points given the ease with which they were chewing off yardage in the first half. Even if the Packers defense adjusted in the second half, the 49ers should still be able to motor along and collect three field goals over 25-ish minutes of playtime. Seemed like a solid bet, so long as the 49ers continued to play well into the second half.</p>

<p><em>Except they failed to do so.</em></p>

<p>Kyle Shanahan offered up some unusually anemic playcalling that second half. Just look at the table below:</p>

<h6 id="49ers-passing-stats">49ers passing stats</h6>

<p>The table assumes we are excluding the last three plays</p>

<p>31 plays in the first half versus 23 plays in the second half.</p>

<p>15 passes attempted in the first half versus 9 passes attempted.</p>
