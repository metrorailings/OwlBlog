		<div class='postTitle'>Analyzing Conference Rematches in the Postseason</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>Something dawned on me now that the conference finals this year will be rematches between teams that faced each other once before earlier in the year. Do teams that lose the first match have an advantage in the playoff rematch?</p>

<p>To find out, let&rsquo;s analyze data going back to 2009.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2009">2009</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Colts (17)</strong> @ Ravens (15)</li>
<li>Colts (15) @ <strong>Jets (29)</strong></li>
<li>Ravens (21) @ <strong>Patriots (27)</strong></li>
<li>Bengals (0) @ <strong>Jets (37)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Packers (33)</strong> @ Cardinals (7)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Ravens (3) @ <strong>Colts (20)</strong></li>
<li>Jets (17) @ <strong>Colts (30)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ravens (33)</strong> @ Patriots (14)</li>
<li><strong>Jets (24)</strong> @ Bengals (14)</li>
<li>Packers (45) @ <strong>Cardinals (51)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 3 matches and different results in 3 matches. Some games here have circumstances worth mentioning - in the Colts loss to the Jets, Peyton Manning was pulled early for some strange reason. Apparently, Jim Caldwell didn&rsquo;t care much about maintaining an undefeated record through the season. The Jets-Bengals games were literally back-to-back, as their regular season encounter took place on the last week of the season. Oddly enough, the Cowboys and the Eagles were in a similar situation, playing each other on the last week of the season only to have to play each other again in the Wild Card round. The games played out the same way both ways - the Cowboys were able to win in domineering fashion. It makes me wonder whether the second meeting between two teams meeting one another on consecutive weeks favors the winner of the first meeting.</p>

<p>Once again, we have another incidence here of teams meeting one another on back-to-back meetings - the Packers and the Cardinals. However, the Cardinals trotted out their back-up quarterback in the first match, so the rematch was a little different. Aaron Rodgers and his crew were able to rack up more points in the rematch though.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2010">2010</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Packers (27)</strong> @ Eagles (20)</li>
<li>Packers (17) @ <strong>Falcons (20)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Jets (22)</strong> @ Steelers (17)</li>
<li>Seahawks (19) @ <strong>Saints (34)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Seahawks (23)</strong> @ Bears (20)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Packers (21)</strong> @ Eagles (16)</li>
<li><strong>Packers (48)</strong> @ Falcons (21)</li>
<li>Jets (19) @ <strong>Steelers (24)</strong></li>
<li>Saints (36) @ <strong>Seahawks (41)</strong></li>
<li>Seahawks (24) @ <strong>Bears (35)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 1 match and different results in 4 matches. Once again, a caveat here worth noting for the one set of games with the same results. The first match between the Packers and the Eagles took place on the first week of the season, so I&rsquo;m not too sure whether that game can be justifiably linked to its playoff counterpart given that the first week of the season tends to be a bit wild.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2011">2011</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Packers (38)</strong> @ Giants (35)</li>
<li>Giants (20) @ <strong>49ers (27)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Patriots (41)</strong> @ Broncos (23)</li>
<li>Lions (17) @ <strong>Saints (31)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Texans (20)</strong> @ Bengals (19)</li>
<li>Texans (14) @ <strong>Ravens (29)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Giants (37)</strong> @ Packers (20)</li>
<li><strong>Giants (20)</strong> @ 49ers (17)</li>
<li>Broncos (10) @ <strong>Patriots (45)</strong></li>
<li>Lions (28) @ <strong>Saints (45)</strong></li>
<li>Bengals (10) @ <strong>Texans (31)</strong></li>
<li>Texans (13) @ <strong>Ravens (20)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 4 matches and different results in 2 matches. Not much to caveat here, though it is worth noting the Texans were forced to go down their quarterback depth chart in the rematch against the Bengals. Not that it mattered much though, as Houston was still able to pull out the win.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2012">2012</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Patriots (30) @ <strong>Ravens (31)</strong></li>
<li>Ravens (17) @ <strong>Broncos (34)</strong></li>
<li><strong>49ers (30)</strong> @ Packers (22)</li>
<li>Texans (14) @ <strong>Patriots (42)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ravens (28)</strong> @ Patriots (13)</li>
<li><strong>Ravens (38)</strong> @ Broncos (35)</li>
<li>Packers (31) @ <strong>49ers (45)</strong></li>
<li>Texans (28) @ <strong>Patriots (41)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 3 matches and a different result in 1 match.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that in the postseason rematch, all the losers in the first meeting did far better from a points perspective. Even the Packers, who were quite frankly lucky to have posted up 22 points against the 49ers in their first encounter.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2013">2013</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Saints (7) @ <strong>Seahawks (34)</strong></li>
<li>Broncos (31) @ <strong>Patriots (34)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Colts (23)</strong> @ Chiefs (7)</li>
<li><strong>Bengals (17)</strong> @ Chargers (10)</li>
<li>Packers (28) @ <strong>49ers (34)</strong></li>
<li>49ers (9) @ <strong>Panthers (10)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Saints (15) @ <strong>Seahawks (23)</strong></li>
<li>Patriots (16) @ <strong>Broncos (26)</strong></li>
<li>Chiefs (44) @ <strong>Colts (45)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chargers (27)</strong> @ Bengals (10)</li>
<li><strong>49ers (23)</strong> @ Packers (20)</li>
<li><strong>49ers (23)</strong> @ Panthers (10)</li>
</ul>

<p>We have the same result in 3 matches and different results in 3 matches. It&rsquo;s worth noting the 49ers win against the Packers in the regular season came in the first week of the season. Nonetheless, I do see a theme here - the losers in the regular season performed better in the playoff rematch.</p>

<h2 id="2014">2014</h2>

<p><em>Regular Season</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Patriots (42)</strong> @ Colts (20)</li>
<li>Packers (16) @ <strong>Seahawks (36)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Seahawks (13)</strong> @ Panthers (9)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Playoffs</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Colts (7) @ <strong>Patriots (45)</strong></li>
<li>Packers (22) @ <strong>Seahawks (28)</strong></li>
<li>Panthers (17) @ <strong>Seahawks (31)</strong></li>
</ul>
