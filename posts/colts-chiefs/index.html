		<div class='postTitle'>Division Round Preview - Colts @ Chiefs</div>

				<p>An exciting rematch of a thriller from not too long ago, when Andrew Luck staged one of the greatest postseason comebacks in history.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Division Round Analysis - Colts @ Chiefs.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So this is a very interesting match. Both teams have distinct advantages over one another. The Chiefs are rolling into the contest with 3 elite pass rushers and home field advantage. The Colts, meanwhile, come to Arrowhead Stadium with the more experienced quarterback and a more dynamic offense.</p>

<p>On coaching, you have a coach of the year candidate in Frank Reich versus Skinny himself, Andy Reid. Reid is a fantastic coach - his coaching tree is a testament to his brilliance as a head coach. But the problem is that the man has had a losing record in the playoffs dating back to 2008. Just the past couple years alone, the Chiefs have only posted a pathetic 1-4 record in the postseason. Their lone playoff win came against a Texans team led by a second-string quarterback and an idiot coach. So it&rsquo;s fair to say that Kansas City has yet to win a truly meaningful playoff game under Reid, leaving many people convinced that Andy is simply unable to shepherd a team through the postseason.</p>

<p>However in his defense, Reid never had an elite quarterback since he assumed control of the Chiefs back in 2013. Even in his best year, Alex Smith was nothing more than a second-tier quarterback. Mahomes actually presents an exciting opportunity for Reid here - for the first time, the Chiefs can now execute any play Andy draws up, as the team is no longer limited at quarterback. So if anything, <strong><em>this year</em></strong> is the real litmus test as to whether Andy Reid is doomed to fail in the playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Colts actually stand a good shot at upsetting the top-seeded Chiefs here, given their offensive advantages. It&rsquo;s weird to think that the Chiefs are short-handed at offense given some of their performances this season, but ever since the team forced Kareem Hunt out, Kansas has not been able to find that third option that can provide an added dimension to the offense. That being said, if Patrick Mahomes is able to shake off any postseason jitters early into the game, the Chiefs should carry this game and advance toward the conference championships. How fast it will take the presumptive MVP to ward off nerves depends in part on Andy Reid&rsquo;s ability to manage his star player&rsquo;s emotions. So this is your moment to shine, Andy.</p>
