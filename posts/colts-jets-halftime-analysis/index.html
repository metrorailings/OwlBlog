		<div class='postTitle'>Colts @ Jets - Halftime Quick Analysis</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'><p>So didn&rsquo;t do a Supercontest write-up here, but the Colts (+2.5) were one of my picks And it looked somepromising in the first quarter. Despite an unfortunate pick-six on the second play of the game, Andrew Luck and the Colts were producing yards and moving the ball fairly smoothly through the air.</p>

<p>But the Colts went out of their way to prove that the first turnover was no fluke. A fumble in the second quarter helped the Jets post seven more points on the board. Then an interception (induced by tight man coverage) led to three more points for the Jets prior to the second quarter ending. New York now sits as 10-point leaders going into halftime.</p>

<p>Long story short, the Colts receivers are a truly pathetic bunch. And I include the runningbacks in there as well. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe Indy&rsquo;s skill players decided to coat their gloves with butter for shits and giggles, but the team is having a damn hard time possessing the ball, let alone running free from a Jets secondary that are not world-beaters by any means.</p>

<p>I hope Frank Reich is verbally whupping some ass in the locker room as I type this.</p>
