		<div class='postTitle'>Colts over Texans - Quick Analysis</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				Several quick points to make here&hellip;.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bill O&rsquo;Brien is a terrible coach. Too many times, I saw Indianapolis had a beat on the Texans&rsquo; offensive schemes before the snap. Honestly, the Colts knew Houston&rsquo;s playbook better than some of Houston&rsquo;s own skill players.</li>
<li>Penalties. The Texans committed too many sloppy pre-snap penalties, two of which sustained drives that led to Colt touchdowns. Not only are these players stupid for drawing these penalties, but Houston&rsquo;s coaching bears some blame here for letting these guys play so undisciplined.</li>
<li>Deshaun Watson was shook for much of the game. I thought his recent experience playing in the college championship would help him adjust quickly to the playoff atmosphere&hellip;but I was wrong. Watson constantly threw passes short or wide of the mark. Furthermore, any chemistry Deshaun developed with his skill players over the season was completely absent this game. Watson threw several passes that should have been picked off had the Colts&rsquo; defenders been a touch quicker.</li>
<li>The Colts burst out of the gate with three straight scoring drives. I was an idiot for thinking Indianapolis would play sloppy early on given their relative inexperience. The reality is that Indianapolis&rsquo; playoffs began last week against the Titans. That was the game for Indy to untangle itself of any postseason jitters. Truth be told, Indy played almost mistake-free in this game. The Colts only turned the ball over once, and that was on a batted pass.</li>
<li>Clowney was disappointing. The man was blanked when it came to rushing the quarterback. No sacks, hits, or batted passes.</li>
</ul>
