				<p>The Steelers slipping out of playoff contention allowed the Indianapolis Colts to work their way into the postseason as the sixth seed of the American Football Conference. How far will Andrew Luck go in his comeback year?</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-andrew-luck">Quarterback: <em>Andrew Luck</em></h4>

<p>Luck will win the Comeback Player of the Year award. Nothing else needs to be said. Under Frank Reich, Luck has not only regained his old form, but adopted a quick release into his passing style. Even though statistics rarely tell the full story on a quarterback&rsquo;s performance in a given season, Andrew Luck&rsquo;s year can actually be summed up fairly well by two simple data points - 39 touchdowns thrown en route to a 4500 yard season. Pretty damn good.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-t-y-hilton-eric-ebron-marlon-mack">Offensive Weapons: <em>T.Y. Hilton, Eric Ebron, Marlon Mack</em></h4>

<p>Luck&rsquo;s success this year rubbed off on Eric Ebron, a man I was ready to write off as a draft bust. Under the tutelage of Andrew Luck and Frank Reich, Ebron revamped himself into a top-tier tight end. Not only does Luck love throwing the ball to him in the end zone, but he&rsquo;s one of Andrew&rsquo;s two favorite options on third down. T.Y. Hilton is that other skill player Luck consistently relies upon on to convert third downs, which shouldn&rsquo;t be much of a surprise.</p>

<p>What may be a bit of a surprise is Marlon Mack&rsquo;s inclusion on this list. The changes the Colts made to the offensive line over the offseason served the  young man well. With an offensive line that can actually push defensive linemen around, Mack produced nearly 1000 yards rushing from scrimmage, at nearly 5 years per attempt.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-n-a">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>N/A</em></h4>

<p>We have a problem here. The Colts have no studs lining up on the defensive line. Jabaal Sheard may be the best lineman on the team, but he&rsquo;s designed to stop the run, not rush the passer.</p>

<p>Without a single elite pass rusher, the Colts defense will be a massive liability.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>Yet another negative here. Quite a few people on the roster lack recent playoff experience. Key players like Andrew Luck and T.Y. Hilton last logged playing time in the postseason back in 2014, so it remains uncertain as to how quick these two (let alone other players) can adjust to the postseason environment.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-frank-reich-hc-matt-eberflus-dc">Coach: <em>Frank Reich (HC), Matt Eberflus (DC)</em></h4>

<p>Frank Reich has done well with a team that did fairly little during free agency. Not only do the Colts play much better than the sum of their parts, but he&rsquo;s successfully eased a shaken Andrew Luck back into the sport. Reich deserves commendations for the job he has done here. Honestly&hellip;I&rsquo;d vote him as the Coach of the Year.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>Kudos to the Colts for making the playoffs after such a horrendous season last year. That being said&hellip;the next game against Houston will be the last game of their season.</p>
