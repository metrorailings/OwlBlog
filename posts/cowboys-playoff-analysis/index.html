		<div class='postTitle'>Dallas Cowboys - Playoff Analysis</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>The Dallas Cowboys are officially the 4th seed in the National Football Conference playoffs. Jerry Jones and the <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/SGWqZBe0hCj3nlr0Dn/giphy.gif">Clapper</a> will be leading their men into the postseason, starting Wild Card weekend with a home showing against the Seahawks (most likely).</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-dak-prescott">Quarterback: <em>Dak Prescott</em></h4>

<p>Dak Prescott is not an elite quarterback. All of the strengths we associate with top-tier quarterbacks - accuracy, decision-making, composure under pressure, efficiency&hellip;none of these are traits that can be associated with Dak. Even after Jerry Jones dealt a 1st-rounder for Amari Cooper in an attempt to inject life into their lame passing attack, Prescott still remains pretty awful. Pro Football Focus has him billed as one of the worst quarterbacks at throwing the deep ball from Week 10 onward, posting only a 30% accuracy rate on deep passes thrown.</p>

<p>The first three quarters of Dallas&rsquo; home game against Philadelphia illustrates exactly why the man is more a liability than an asset in the Cowboys offense. Whatever magic the guy possessed in 2016 is lost this year.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-ezekiel-elliott-amari-cooper">Offensive Weapons: <em>Ezekiel Elliott, Amari Cooper</em></h4>

<p>No doubt, Ezekiel Elliott is the best skill player the Ladyboys field on offense. He&rsquo;ll end up as the NFL&rsquo;s rushing champion again, but his ability to produce on short pass plays is just as valuable as his mettle as a runner.</p>

<p>As stated before when I was talking about the quarterback, the Cowboys passing game was virtually nonexistent until Amari Cooper was acquired midway through the season. It didn&rsquo;t take long for Amari to become the team&rsquo;s #1 receiver. His talents have been critical in winning key games. And the numbers bear this out as well - Dak has targeted Cooper on 20+% of his routes from Week 10 onward, far more than any other receiver or tight end on his team and second only to Ezekiel.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-demarcus-lawrence">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Demarcus Lawrence</em></h4>

<p>With 23 quarterback hits and 40 solo tackles credited to him, Demarcus Lawrence is indeed an elite edge rusher.</p>

<p>The only other player with any sort of elite potential is David Irving, but injuries have largely sidelined him for most of the season. Even if he returns in the postseason, I&rsquo;m going to err on the safe side here and assume his contributions will be minimal.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>A good number of Cowboy starters have recent playoff experience, thanks largely to that 2016 season where they won top seeding in the NFC. The only units on the team without any significant playoff experience is the back seven of the defense. Outside of Sean Lee and Byron Jones, this season will mark the first time the linebackers and defensive backs will see any sort of playoff action.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-jason-garrett-hc-rod-marinelli-dc-scott-linehan-oc">Coach: <em>Jason Garrett (HC), Rod Marinelli (DC), Scott Linehan (OC)</em></h4>

<p>What can I say about the Clapper? Despite his several years of being a head coach in the league, I still have yet to see much improvement on his part. Ever since Week 1, the Cowboys passing game has remained a consistent point of weakness. Even though the air game saw some new life thanks to Amari Cooper, it still remains pretty wretched. Worse yet, Linehan and Garrett seem stubbornly insistent on playing Dak as a pocket passer, even though his singular best talent is his mobility.</p>

<p>Garrett did try to shake things up a bit - he fired his offensive line coach midway through the season following some disappointing outings from that unit, but I&rsquo;m not sure if the new coach has truly changed things much. And that concisely describes the Cowboys team - despite bit changes here and there, little has been done to move the needle on offense. If anything, the team should thank Rod Marinelli for marshaling one of the league&rsquo;s best defenses. It was through their prowess on defense that the Ladyboys were able to claim the NFC East.</p>
