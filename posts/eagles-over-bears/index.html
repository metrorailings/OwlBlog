		<div class='postTitle'>Eagles over Bears - Quick Analysis</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>Some quick points&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Incredibly hard-fought match. I would say Matt Nagy out-coached Doug Pederson here. Lining Allen Robinson up over cornerback Avonte Maddox and having him run double moves on the young defensive back yielded big gains in the pass game. The Eagles took a little too long to fix that issue.</p></li>

<li><p>Mitch Trubisky handled his nerves well. He threw two bad throws early on that should have been picked if the Eagles&rsquo; cornerbacks were just a bit more sure-handed. One of those passes could have actually been returned by the Eagles for a defensive touchdown. Still, it&rsquo;s clear to me that whatever jitters he may have had were shaken off by the end of the second quarter.</p></li>

<li><p>The Eagles&rsquo; pass rush was limp on most plays. I understand the Eagles were deathly concerned about Trubisky&rsquo;s tendency to scramble wildly, but not much emphasis was placed on even pressuring the young quarterback. From what I noticed, the Eagles were too content just bull rushing the pocket and sending only four men to rush the passer. Trubisky was way too comfortable in the pocket at times. Bull rushes only work on offensive lines that flat out suck. The Bears have one of the best offensive lines in the league and it seems as if Philadelphia&rsquo;s brain trust wasn&rsquo;t aware of that.</p></li>
</ul>
