				<p>With a little help from the Bears, the Eagles have slipped back into the playoffs as the bottom seed in the National Football Conference. Will Nick&rsquo;s BD work its magic again this year?</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-nick-foles-nate-sudfeld">Quarterback: <em>Nick Foles / Nate Sudfeld</em></h4>

<p>Nick Foles seems like an elite quarterback. Watching film from yesterday&rsquo;s game against the Redskins, I saw him looking off zone defenders, taking whatever opportunities were available to him, and throwing the ball with a little touch in order to hit his receivers in stride.</p>

<p>But the man didn&rsquo;t throw a single deep ball in yesterday&rsquo;s game. His longest play was an 18-yard sideline pass to Alshon Jeffery. And I wonder if it&rsquo;s related to injuries related to a rib shot he sustained last week against Houston. If his ribs are truly an issue, than Nick will have a tough time surviving this postseason -  the hits will continue to mount for Foles as opposing pass rushers will likely dominate a weakened Eagles offensive line. And if his play is hindered in any way, the Eagles lose whatever hope they have left to go far into the playoffs.</p>

<p>Worse yet, if Foles were to ever be knocked out of a game, then Nate Sudfeld will be forced to take the reigns of the offense. The Eagles might be better off waving a white flag at that point.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-alshon-jeffery-zach-ertz">Offensive Weapons: <em>Alshon Jeffery, Zach Ertz</em></h4>

<p>Jeffery and Ertz are the two most important skill players on the team. Jeffery in particular seems to be more valuable than Ertz at this point. Despite Ertz&rsquo;s historic season and sure hands, something tells me Foles has more of a liking for Jeffery and his ability to outmuscle defensive backs for the football.</p>

<p>On a bit of a side note, If there&rsquo;s one area in which this year&rsquo;s Eagles differ the most from last year&rsquo;s Eagles, it&rsquo;s offensive weaponry. The championship team from last year could also count on Nelson Agholor in the slot and a strong rushing attack led by Jay Ajayi, in addition to Zach Ertz and Alshon Jeffery. All those weapons were critical in helping Foles play at an unbelievably elite level heading into the Super Bowl. This year though&hellip;Agholor has regressed back to mediocrity and not a single running back has come even close to matching the rushing numbers from last year. It&rsquo;s not only injuries that have wrecked the ground game - the entire offensive line seemed to have taken a gigantic step backward in terms of run-blocking. Watching several of their games this season, I noticed there were too many times halfbacks were met in the backfield by opposing defenders. I remember noting early in the season that generic blitzes were killing this offensive line. I&rsquo;m sure things have improved, but it&rsquo;s worrisome that an offensive line coming off a banner year would find themselves struggling with basic blitz concepts.</p>

<p>But there is hope for Philly - Josh Adams seems to be impressing in the ground game, albeit in spurts. And against Washington, the interior of the offensive line was actually able to generate push on a consistent basis. Still though, I&rsquo;m going to play things cautiously here and assume that this team is not ready to hang its hat on Adams yet - for any halfback to be considered a significant offensive weapon, I need to see sustained success against decent teams. So if Philly can run the ball with some success against Chicago and New Orleans&hellip;then I&rsquo;ll be adding Josh Adams&rsquo; name to this list.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-michael-bennett-fletcher-cox">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Michael Bennett, Fletcher Cox</em></h4>

<p>Both Michael Bennett and Fletcher Cox have been lighting up opposing quarterbacks all season. Bennett has been an especially impressive addition to the roster this year, taking the mantle of chief edge rusher away from the disappointing Brandon Graham. Fletcher Cox, meanwhile, is still up to his old ways, racking up roughly 35 quarterback hits over the course of the season.</p>

<p>An argument could be made that Chris Long should be added to the list. He&rsquo;s registered 20 hits on opposing quarterbacks, more than that of other edge rushers I consider elite, like Melvin Ingram. Still, his mundane tackling numbers makes me a bit wary here. I&rsquo;ll revisit this section later should the Eagles win their first game against the Bears.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>Normally, playoff inexperience should be no concern to the reigning Super Bowl champions, but most of the starting defensive backs will be playing in the postseason for the first time. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the corners are a bit rattled initially against Chicago, especially given that it&rsquo;s a road game.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-doug-pederson-hc-mike-groh-oc-jim-schwartz-dc">Coach: <em>Doug Pederson (HC), Mike Groh (OC), Jim Schwartz (DC)</em></h4>

<p>Doug Pederson has proved himself after going on a Super Bowl run with a team that was racked with injuries. Likewise, Jim Schwartz is a proven commodity at defensive coordinator. So there should be no doubt that the coaching staff here is talented.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>Believe it or not, the Eagles could actually reach the Super Bowl. Yeah, I said it&hellip;the Eagles could end up as NFC champions yet again. <strong>BUT&hellip;</strong><em>only if  Nick Foles remains healthy.</em> If Foles is seriously injured at any point during the postseason, the Eagles will be cleaning out their lockers pretty damn soon afterwards. Guaranteed.</p>
