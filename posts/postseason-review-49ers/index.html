		<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - San Francisco 49ers</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>The 49ers enter the postseason as the top seed. So let&rsquo;s examine their prospects using my trusty old rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Unsure. The last three weeks of the season were bizarre. One game was lost to an underwhelming Atlanta team riding the coattails of Julio Jones. The other two games were unnecessarily close. Yes, I acknowledge that key pieces of their defense were sidelined due to injury but it still doesn&rsquo;t sit well with me.</p>

<p>Then again, San Francisco did go on a rough five-week stretch in which they faced off against four playoff teams. While their record for those weeks includes two losses, those losses were hard-fought.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>No. I still contend that Robert Saleh cannot be considered an elite coach. The team&rsquo;s success on defense comes so much more from talent rather than scheme. In fact, Saleh&rsquo;s approach to defense has been notoriously failing for other teams around the league, whether in Jacksonville or Atlanta or Los Angeles or even Seattle.</p>

<p>On top of that, the Arizona Cardinals managed to ring up points against this defense in two (almost) back-to-back meetings, even though their scheme on offense is pretty obviously configured to favor short passes.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>No. Jimmy Garoppalo lacks meaningful playoff experience. Likewise, Deebo Samuel and George Kittle, two of the most valuable skill players, lack postseason experience.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>No. The passing offense on this team has seen some great success courtesy of scheme and raw talent instead of quarterback competence. Credit due to Garoppolo though - he&rsquo;s been excellent in his direction of Kyle Shanahan&rsquo;s system. So was Matt Ryan the year the Falcons went to the Super Bowl with Shanahan at offensive coordinator - Ryan&rsquo;s play was taken to whole another level. I feel the same applies here as well, in that Garoppalo&rsquo;s numbers have been inflated thanks to a system that prides itself on misdirection and unpredictability. While Jimmy has shined in his execution of this system, he hasn&rsquo;t even come close to matching the same success Ryan had running these same concepts.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Without a doubt. Kyle Shanahan has whipped this offense into something magical. Only Baltimore has a scarier offense, to be honest.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h2>

<p><strong><em>Nick Bosa</em></strong> is this team&rsquo;s premiere pass-rusher.</p>

<p>After him, <strong><em>Arik Armstead</em></strong> presents a strong case here, given his numbers alone. Past the numbers, I&rsquo;ve observed Armstead constantly making plays throughout the season, justifying his designation here as an elite pass rusher.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dee Ford</em></strong> is potentially another name worth adding to this list, though things remain uncertain given his complicated injury history this season.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>On the other hand, the Patriots are not in so good a shape here. <strong><em>Julian Edelman</em></strong> is clearly a vector given the trust Brady has vested in him, but Edelman&rsquo;s inclusion as a vector is only meaningful so long as he remains healthy <em>enough</em> over the course of the postseason. Injuries have hammered him repeatedly through the season and it seems as if things will be no different for the playoffs.</p>

<p><strong><em>James White</em></strong> is the only other player that I can confidently assert as a vector here, given his ability to catch balls out of the backfield.</p>

<p>I have a hard time considering <strong><em>Sony &ldquo;Playstation&rdquo; Michel</em></strong> and <strong><em>Rex Burkhead</em></strong> a vector here as the Patriots offensive line have been pretty flaccid in their run-blocking. Though it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Patriots have been so much better running the ball the past three weeks, so we can&rsquo;t completely rule out the ground game as a possible vector. More footage needs to be put on tape before I correct myself here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Surprisingly, yes. Despite their struggles over the season with field goals, it seems the Patriots finally found somebody that can kick them through the uprights consistently. Folk only missed three field goals all year, two in inclement weather and one that was blocked when the Patriots line broke down inside.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Stephon Gilmore. One could also include Devin McCourty with his five interceptions.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Patriots are not nearly as bad as the media narratives claim. Still, their limp offense will cost them dearly on the road in Kansas City.</p>
