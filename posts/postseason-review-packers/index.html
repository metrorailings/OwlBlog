		<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Green Bay Packers</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>Last but not least, the Packers entered the postseason unexpectedly with a bye. Using the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>, let&rsquo;s get a sense of this team&rsquo;s prospects.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>I would say so. Despite the fact that this team has played pretty poorly over the season, the Packers have successfully closed out a number of close games. Even in their losses, Green Bay has shown a willingness to try and claw their way to a quick win. In only one game have the Packers been completely dominated from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Given this is Matt LaFleur&rsquo;s first year as a head coach, it&rsquo;s impossible to go off history here. LaFleur hasn&rsquo;t been particularly inspiring either with his sideline presence, though his honesty is pretty refreshing. But given their  season record in spite of their performance, I&rsquo;m actually comfortable giving this team the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. I&rsquo;ll give credit to Pettine for bringing over free agents that had an immediate impact on defense. I&rsquo;ll also give credit to Pettine for embracing a riskier style of defense that leaves the unit more exposed to rushes. Even though their yardage numbers could be better, the defense has still stepped up when expected.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<hr />

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>
