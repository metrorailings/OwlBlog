		<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Green Bay Packers</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>Last but not least, the Packers entered the postseason unexpectedly with a bye. Using the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>, let&rsquo;s get a sense of this team&rsquo;s prospects.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>I would say so. Despite the fact that this team has played pretty poorly over the season, the Packers have successfully closed out a number of close games. Even in their losses, Green Bay has shown a willingness to try and claw their way to a quick win. In only one game have the Packers been completely dominated from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Given this is Matt LaFleur&rsquo;s first year as a head coach, it&rsquo;s impossible to go off history here. LaFleur hasn&rsquo;t been particularly inspiring either with his sideline presence, though his honesty is pretty refreshing. But given their  season record in spite of their performance, I&rsquo;m actually comfortable giving this team the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. I&rsquo;ll give credit to Pettine for bringing over free agents that had an immediate impact on defense. I&rsquo;ll also give credit to Pettine for embracing a riskier style of defense that leaves the unit more exposed to rushes. Even though their yardage numbers could be better, the defense has still stepped up in key moments.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes and no. Rodgers, Davante Adams, and most of his offensive line have considerable postseason experience. The other wide receivers not named Davante Adams are green here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>No. On multiple occasions have I noted my disappointment with Aaron Rodgers this season. Rodgers has some of the best pass protection in the league and yet I still see too many moments when Rodgers is dancing in the pocket for several seconds trying to find an open receiver.</p>

<p>The reality is that this has been going on now for the past several years. Rodgers holds on to the ball waiting on one of his receivers to break free, but in this league, the quarterback has to assume some responsibility, either for failing to build a rapport with his receivers or being unwilling to throw into tight coverage. Great quarterbacks like Brady and Peyton Manning have successfully worked with no-name receivers. The fact that Rodgers is still stubbornly sticking to his old habits despite being under a new offensive system is concerning. It tells me the problem may not have been McCarthy (as some surmised) but rather with Rodgers insisting on running a system that befits him, regardless of whatever other offensive philosophy towards which the team has committed itself.</p>

<p>For his obstinance and his stale numbers this year, Rodgers cannot be classified as an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>No, for the same reasons listed above. A good offensive coordinator or coach needs to be at least in sync with his quarterback. It&rsquo;s clear that LaFleur and Rodgers are too far apart from one another - the result has been an offense that stagnates way too much.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Za&rsquo;Darius Smith</em></strong> can be considered the best pass rusher in the league, in my opinion. His ability to single-handedly stop drives with negative plays is something impressive.</p>

<p>His brother from another mother, <strong><em>Preston Smith</em></strong>, can be counted as an elite pass rusher. Though not nearly as impressive as Za&rsquo;Darius, he&rsquo;s put up some respectable numbers in his own right.</p>

<p><strong><em>Kenny Clark</em></strong> is the only other name worth considering, though his numbers fall far below what would be expected from an elite player. The fact of the matter is that he&rsquo;s broken out the last several weeks, so if he continues his streak into the playoffs, Clark can be a difference maker.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>Only two - <strong><em>Davante Adams</em></strong> and <strong><em>Aaron Jones</em></strong>. Davante is the only receiver Aaron fully trusts on offense, as his numbers should indicate. Aaron Jones is the workhouse at tailback for an offense that prizes running the ball to establish the play-action game.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, possibly all through the playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Yes. Crosby has only missed two kicks all year, both in situations that ultimately did not matter.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>
