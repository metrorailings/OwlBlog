		<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Baltimore Ravens</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>The Ravens enter the postseason as the top seed of the American Football Conference. Let&rsquo;s break them down using my good old rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Without a doubt. John Harbaugh has a history of fostering mental fortitude in his teams. That and the way this team dominated their competition after their bye week is enough to show me that this team is not shy on resolve.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Wink Martindale has been a genius in constructing this defense. Having a backfield full of stud defensive backs that can cover has allowed him to blitz the passer with reckless abandon. Despite their lack of dominant trench players, Baltimore can still pressure opposing quarterbacks thanks to the complexity of their blitz packages.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes. Lamar Jackson and most of the offense has postseason experience dating back to last year. Only the receiver corps are a little green in this area.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes. Lamar Jackson isn&rsquo;t necessarily the best passer of the football in the league, but he&rsquo;s been phenomenal running the ball and captaining an offense that&rsquo;s been built to suit his needs. His league MVP title this year is more than enough to justify his designation as an elite quarterback.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Greg Roman has done yeoman&rsquo;s work in crafting the perfect offense around Lamar&rsquo;s skillset. Lamar Jackson is as much a product of Roman&rsquo;s system as he is a product of his own talent. The emphasis on rushing the ball a multitude of different ways as well as all the different ways tight ends are utilized has lent this offense a peculiarly rich quality not matched by any other team in the league this year.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h2>

<p>Only one - <strong><em>Matthew Judon</em></strong>. Judon has been dominant manhandling the offensive line and negotiating through the backfield this year, racking up at least 33 hits on the quarterback. If the Ravens would have opted to keep Za&rsquo;Darius Smith, this defensive unit would easily have the best pass rush in the league. Instead, Smith left for greener pastures and the Ravens don&rsquo;t have any other pass rushers worth bragging about.</p>

<p>The Ravens success in pressuring opposing quarterbacks in this team has come mostly from scheme and Judon&rsquo;s talent.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The biggest and most obvious vector is <strong><em>Lamar Jackson</em></strong>. His ability to run and scramble with the football has sent opposing defenses reeling. People haven&rsquo;t seen a running quarterback like Lamar since the early days of Michael Vick. Working in tandem with <strong><em>Mark Ingram</em></strong> in the backfield has made his runs all the more dangerous as well, as teams have to account for the fact that both Ingram and Jackson can be a runner on any given play.</p>

<p>In terms of receiving weaponry, we have Lamar&rsquo;s favorite tight end in <strong><em>Mark Andrews</em></strong> and his favorite receiver in <strong><em>Marquise &ldquo;Hollywood&rdquo; Brown</em></strong> - the former has ran an impressive 2.89 yards per route run while the latter has served the team well as a traditional X receiver.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hayden Hurst</em></strong> and <strong><em>Nick Boyle</em></strong> are a possible set of names worth mentioning. While it&rsquo;s hard to define either of them as vectors given their lack of numbers and game-changing plays, the Ravens run quite a number of formations with multiple tight ends out there. Hayden Hurst and Nick Boyle are usually those other tight ends out there with Mark Andrews.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, all through the AFC playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Yes. Justin Tucker is still playing like a future hall of famer this year.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Once again, yes. I would actually argue this team has three elite players in the backfield - Earl Thomas, Marcus Peters, and Marlon Humphrey. All three have been recognized this year as Pro Bowlers. On top of that, Peters and Humphrey made made the All-Pro team as well.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>A Super Bowl berth is all but certain here. The only real competition Baltimore might see in the AFC playoffs are the Chiefs, but I have a hard time seeing the Chiefs as a serious threat - their defense lacks the horses to keep the Ravens offense sidelined.</p>
