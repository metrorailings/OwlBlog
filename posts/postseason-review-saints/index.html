		<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - New Orleans Saints</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>The Saints oddly only the 3rd seed in the NFC due to some unfortunate luck when Drew Brees injured his thumb against the Rams and an underprepared Teddy Bridgewater had to step into his place. Even still, New Orleans has been billed as one of the favorites to win. Let&rsquo;s use the  the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a> to see exactly why.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>No doubt. Winning five straight games without Drew Brees alone proves the team can handle hardship. Their comeback win against a surging Titans team in Tennessee is another fine example that exemplifies this team&rsquo;s mental fortitude.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Dennis Allen&rsquo;s tenure as the Saints defensive coach has been largely successful. This year is no different. All three levels of his defense have impressed in one way or another.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes, these Saints have become fixtures in the playoffs, going three years now with postseason outings.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes. Brees continues to break passing records in this league. And unlike last year, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like any nagging injury will be sapping him of his talent.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Sean Payton&rsquo;s a fantastic coach and an even better offensive mind. His ability to scheme up quick passes for Drew Brees has allowed this offense to consistently move the chains on first and second downs instead of third down.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Cameron Jordan</em></strong> can safely be considered an elite pass rusher, given his numbers alone and consistency in production.</p>

<p>While Marcus Davenport, the Saints other starting edge rusher, has been relegated to injured reserve for the season, New Orleans might actually have another man that can step up and pressure the passer on a consistent basis - <strong><em>Demario Davis</em></strong>. Even though Davis has been limited in the number of times he&rsquo;s allowed to rush into the offensive backfield, he&rsquo;s been surprisingly efficient when doing so as of lately. Over the past six weeks, he&rsquo;s tallied up six hits on opposing quarterbacks over 73 rushes. Not too shabby for a middle linebacker.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Saints have at least four different vectors on offense.</p>

<p>The most important one is is <strong><em>Michael Thomas</em></strong>, who earned his billing as the best wide receiver in the NFL this season.</p>

<p><strong><em>Alvin Kamara</em></strong> has still been playing at a high level, even if his numbers are not as impressive as in years past.</p>

<p>The Saints&rsquo; investment in <strong><em>Jared Cook</em></strong> this offseason has paid off in spades, as Drew Brees has found himself a tight end that can run routes along the middle of the field and make tough catches when necessary. In one year, he&rsquo;s become a vital part of the offense, posting over two yards per route run, according to Pro Football Focus.</p>

<p>Lastly, <strong><em>Taysom Hill</em></strong> continues to serve the team well as a utility player who can run all sorts of plays from the quarterback position given his athleticism.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only during the Wild Card round, most likely.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Yes. Will Lutz has been solid this year outside of one bad game against the Bears. I&rsquo;m not sure if the Soldier Field turf played a role in that game though. Either way, his selection to the Pro Bowl this year justifies his consideration as a reliable field goal kicker.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>Yes, Marshon Lattimore qualifies here, given his reputation as a shutdown corner.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>The Saints hold so much promise this year. Though without a bye and real home-field advantage, the Saints still stand as Super Bowl favorites in my book.</p>
