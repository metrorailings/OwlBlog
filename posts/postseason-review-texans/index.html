		<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Houston Texans</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>The Texans have limped into the playoffs as the fourth seed in the AFC. Let&rsquo;s use the rubric <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a> to see if they can go far in the postseason.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Not sure. The Texans have been great at staging late-game comebacks, even on the road. But Houston is such a bipolar team - it seems every good performance is followed by a bad showing. Great showings against the likes of the Chiefs, Patriots, Saints, and Titans have been accompanied by sad displays against the Jaguars, Broncos, Raiders, and Buccaneers.</p>

<p>It seems this team phones in performances whenever they&rsquo;re significant favorites, similar to the championship Giants of 2011. Except those Giants went through a gauntlet of playoff-caliber teams midway through the season that really helped them adjust mentally to a difficult postseason. The Texans haven&rsquo;t gone through a murderer&rsquo;s row of games this season.</p>

<p>Houston did go through some hardships this season when they lost JJ Watt for half the season. While none of its other pass rushers have stepped up in Watt&rsquo;s absence, the Texans defense were able to compensate with some strong performances from the revamped defensive backfield.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll say yes here though, going off Bill O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s past history.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue yes. Romeo Crennel&rsquo;s willingness to experiment with the blitz and incorporate cast-offs into his defensive backfield says something about his drive to make this defense better. The defense also had a few stellar games this year, most notably against the Patriots in a big prime-time spot and the Jaguars over in London.</p>

<p>One thing does give me pause here - the way the defense has tanked this year compared to years past. It&rsquo;s just not the same defense - this team has been too happy to give up yardage at times. Then again, maybe Houston can&rsquo;t help itself in this area given the impotence of the pass rush following JJ Watt&rsquo;s chest injury.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>Yes, they do.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Without a doubt. Lamar Jackson aside, Deshaun Watson has been the most electric quarterback this season. The Texans are never out of contention so long as Watson is leading this offense.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>No. I see Bill O&rsquo;Brien has more of an appetite for experimentation and change this season, but he still baffles me from time to time with his insistence on running offensive concepts that have been failing more often than now. His blind devotion to inside zone runs and his poor play-action scheming are good examples of concepts that are featured prominently in the playbook even if they haven&rsquo;t proven themselves for long stretches.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>Only one - <strong><em>JJ Watt</em></strong>. As Rivers McCown has noted time and time again in his articles about the Texans this year, nobody else on Houston has adequately stepped up as a dominant pass rusher. Jacob Martin and Whitney Mercilus have shown flashes of brilliance, but neither have been consistent.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-different-vectors-does-the-team-feature-on-offense">How many different vectors does the team feature on offense?</h3>

<p>The Texans feature a number of different vectors. Their top receiver is <strong><em>DeAndre Hopkins</em></strong>. His AP All-Pro designation this year speaks for itself. <strong><em>Will Fuller</em></strong> also counts as a vector, given his role as the team&rsquo;s main deep threat. Even though Fuller is a basket case when it comes to injury, his presence on offense makes a serious difference - statistical downturns have been documented when Fuller is missing in action. Even though Fuller will be sidelined for the Wild Card game, I&rsquo;m still counting him as a vector as he may be a factor in the games going forward.</p>

<p>When it comes to the ground game, the Texans are pretty productive with the combo of <strong><em>Carlos Hyde</em></strong> and <strong><em>Duke Johnson</em></strong>. Duke Johnson provides more versatility in the passing game whereas Carlos Hyde has been a workhorse, rushing the ball for over 1000 yards on 245 rushes.  And we can&rsquo;t forget about <strong><em>Deshaun Watson</em></strong> and his ability to scramble as well. In fact, the success of their ground game can be partly traced to teams having to honor Watson&rsquo;s ability to run with the ball.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-currently-playing-with-home-field-advantage">Is the team currently playing with home field advantage?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only in the Wild Card round.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-team-feature-a-reliable-field-goal-kicker">Does the team feature a reliable field goal kicker?</h3>

<p>Not sure. Ka&rsquo;imi Fairbairn seems given to streaks. Not to mention his misses tend to come on the road, which may be an indictment on his composure. He&rsquo;s been absolutely perfect the last six weeks though (two of which were on the road), so he&rsquo;s on the right track.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give the Texans the benefit of the doubt here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="does-the-defense-feature-at-least-one-elite-player-in-its-backfield">Does the defense feature at least one elite player in its backfield?</h3>

<p>No. No one defensive back on this team has stood out in my observations on this team.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prognosis">PROGNOSIS</h2>

<p>While a win over the Bills seems likely, their road to the playoffs ends in Baltimore.</p>
