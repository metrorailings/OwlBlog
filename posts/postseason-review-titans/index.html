		<div class='postTitle'>Postseason Review - Tennessee Titans</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>A resurgent Titans squad led by Ryan Tannehill has muscled their way into the playoffs. Let&rsquo;s look at their playoff prospects using the rubric outlined <a href="https://owlpicks.com/posts/postseason-review-team-assessment-rubric/" title="Rubric">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-team-mentally-tough">Is the team mentally tough?</h3>

<p>Yes, sufficiently so. After benching their franchise quarterback for a burn-out from Miami, one would be forgiven for thinking the Titans were done for the season. Instead, their fortunes swung upward - the team found renewed life with a quarterback that wasn&rsquo;t afraid to lob the ball into smaller, riskier windows.</p>

<p>Their goal-line stand against the Chargers in Tannehill&rsquo;s first game as a starter, their surprise wins over the Chiefs and Colts, their respectable performances even in defeat&hellip;all these things point to a team that&rsquo;s not short on resilience.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-defensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-defense">Is the defensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to defense?</h3>

<p>Hard to say, but I&rsquo;d lean towards no. I respect Mike Vrabel and Dean Pees and the work they&rsquo;ve done in their past stints. But it&rsquo;s clear that this Tennessee defense has holes at all three levels. Would things would be worse or better if an average set of coaches were managing the defense? I can&rsquo;t answer for sure.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one example I can use that makes me doubt the minds behind this defense, it was their loose coverage of Michael Thomas a couple weeks ago when the Saints came to town. Being that Thomas is playing at an unreal level right now, one would think it&rsquo;d be wise to bracket him or pay extra attention to him when you execute zone blitzes against Drew Brees. The Titans did neither.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="do-the-quarterback-and-most-of-the-other-key-players-on-the-offense-have-any-playoff-experience">Do the quarterback and most of the other key players on the offense have any playoff experience?</h3>

<p>A good number of the players on the offense have playoff experience, but unfortunately, the quarterback is missing postseason experience on his resume. Ryan Tannehill&rsquo;s first outing as a playoff quarterback will likely result in a few screw-ups.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offense-led-by-an-elite-quarterback">Is the offense led by an elite quarterback?</h3>

<p>Yes, actually. I dare say Tannehill is an elite quarterback. Maybe it&rsquo;s the air in Nashville or the moonshine from the Tennessee backwoods, but Tannehill has found new life under Mike Vrabel and his coaching staff. It&rsquo;s not just the fact that his completion percentage has soared past expectations more than anybody else in the league, according to Next Gen Stats. It&rsquo;s his toughness. I&rsquo;ve seen him get his ass kicked in the game against the Colts and yet, the man still stood in the pocket and make big-time throws.</p>

<p>His skill players have done their fair share to lift this team&rsquo;s fortunes, sure, but it wasn&rsquo;t until Ryan Tannehill was inserted into the lineup as a starter that the offense began realizing its full potential. And that&rsquo;s usually the hallmark of an elite quarterback - being able to lift the play of all his fellow players by his presence alone</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="is-the-offensive-coordinator-or-the-head-coach-a-chess-player-when-it-comes-to-offense">Is the offensive coordinator or the head coach a chess player when it comes to offense?</h3>

<p>Yes. Arthur Smith has molded this offense into one of the better units in the league. Ryan Tannehill certainly helps bolsters his case, but it&rsquo;s more the gadget plays that justify his consideration here as a chess player. Smith has a package of misdirection plays that he usually invokes towards the end of the game to seal away wins. And these plays are remarkably effective as well, having actually won games for the Titans against serious competition.</p>

<p>One can argue that his religious devotion to the run is a bit foolish given that rushing is not nearly as valuable as passing in today&rsquo;s NFL. Still, when you have quite possibly the league&rsquo;s most productive rushing attack, it&rsquo;s hard to blame him for committing so much time and energy to the ground game.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-many-elite-pass-rushers-are-on-this-team">How many elite pass rushers are on this team?</h3>

<p>Arguably none. The only player worthy of consideration here is Harold Landry.</p>
