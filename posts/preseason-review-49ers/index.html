				<h2 id="tier-6"><strong><em>Tier 6</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Jimmy Garoffalo</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>George Kittle (TE), Kyle Juszczyk (FB), Tevin Coleman (RB), Marquise Goodwin (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Jordan Matthews (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>DeForest Buckner (DT), Dee Ford (DE), Nick Bosa (DE), Kwon Alexander (LB), Richard Sherman (CB), Jason Verrett (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>John Lynch (GM), Kyle Shanahan (HC/OC), Robert Saleh (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 8</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, we see a bit of organization and the hiring of even more coaches. Mike LaFleur is no longer the wide receivers coach, though he will remain in his other role as the passing game coordinator. Instead, former star receiver Wes Welker now takes over as the wide receivers coach. Furthermore, a new quarterbacks coach has been hired now that the old one has gone to Denver to serve as their offensive coordinator. Lastly, we see a little shake-up among the offensive assistants, with two of the assistants being released and three new ones being hired this year.</p>

<p>On defense, we see two major changes. The first comes in the backfield, with Joe Woods now taking over as the team’s main secondaries coach and defensive passing game coordinator. The second and more important change comes along that defensive front - a new coach will now be overseeing that group after the old one was fired for fielding a unit that failed to rush the passer effectively.</p>

<hr />

<p>After Jimmy Garoffalo’s untimely ACL tear early in the season, it didn’t take long for the 49ers to quickly spiral downward. Their lack of depth didn’t do the back-up quarterbacks any favors as well.</p>

<p>The team’s prospects this season are a little better, so long as the injury bug doesn’t expose their lack of depth and leaves them crippled at quarterback yet again. The team found a sound complement to Marquise Goodwin in George Kettle. The newly-signed Tevin Coleman should be ready to contribute as well, being familiar with Kyle Shanahan and his system from their time together in Atlanta. Furthermore, the defensive line looks more promising this year, now that Dee Ford and Nick Bosa will be lining up alongside DeForest Buckner. Then again, it’s possible neither of the two additions will pan out - Dee Ford has only posted one solid year so far in his professional career and Nick Bosa is as injury-prone as his older brother. In fact, Bosa is already questionable for the first week. So it’s very possible the 49ers will find themselves saddled with a hopeless pass rush yet again. And that doesn’t bode well for a defensive unit that failed as a whole last year. Though maybe the addition of Kwon Alexander to the linebacking corps could help the back seven limber up - after all, cover-3 defensive shells pretty much mandate a capable middle linebacker in order to see any sustained success. His time in Tampa ended in mixed reviews though, so it remains to be seen whether Alexander can truly deliver.</p>

<p>It’s hard to pin this team’s fortunes this year. Much of their success will depend on the health of key players (most of whom I’ve discussed in the prior paragraph). And even still, the question I posed last year still very much applies this year - will Jimmy Garoffalo be able to step up this season now that the other teams in the league are fully aware of his potential as a starting-caliber quarterback? While his limited play time last year doesn’t offer up much insight about his future prospects, it’s worth noting the young man underwhelmed in the two games he was able to play out. If I was forced to take a side here, I’d go with this team posting a losing record this season.</p>
