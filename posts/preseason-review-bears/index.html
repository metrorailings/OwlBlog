				<h2 id="tier-6"><strong><em>Tier 6</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Mitch Trubisky</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Mitch Trubisky (Mobile QB), Tarik Cohen (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Allen Robinson (WR), Cordarrelle Patterson (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Akeem Hicks (DT), Khalil Mack (DE), Kyle Fuller (CB), Roquan Smith (LB), Danny Trevathan (LB), Buster Skrine (CB), Prince Amukamara (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Ryan Pace (GM), Matt Nagy (HC), Mark Helfrich (OC), Chuck Pagano (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, the staff has remained fully intact, with the addition of Brad Childress as an advisor.</p>

<p>On defense, we have nearly the complete opposite. Only the defensive line coach and a quality control assistant managed to survive the transition from the Vic Fangio era to the Chuck Pagano era. It is worth noting that the quality control coach that was kept from last year has been reassigned as the safeties coach this year. It’ll be interesting to see if this defense can reassume elite form this year given the defensive coaching overhaul.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Bears impressed last year, finally returning to the playoffs as division champions after an eight-year hiatus. This year, it’ll be a steep uphill battle to defend their position atop the North.</p>

<p>One thing that concerns is that coaching overhaul on defense. The new defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano cut his teeth serving as a defensive backs coach for the better part of his NFL career. While he’s successfully trained up cornerbacks and safeties over the years, his track record managing linebackers and defensive linemen has been rather spotty. Furthermore, coaching regime shifts can sometimes be messy, especially if we have new regimes overseeing a unit that was remarkably successful in its last year. And given the success this Chicago defensive outfit saw last year, I wouldn’t be all too surprised to see some tension between the Bear defenders and their new coaches, especially if these coaches insist on having these players do things that run counter to the style of football that made them so dominant last year.</p>

<p>The other thing that concerns me more is Mitch Trubisky. I look at Mitch and I see another Blake Bortles in the making. Mitch is atrocious as a passer. His fundamentals are out of whack. His throws lack accuracy. His decision-making is still questionable. Sure, he played sensationally in his first playoff game against the Eagles last year&hellip;but so did Blake when the Jaguars marched into the postseason two years ago. Those Jaguars actually fought their way to the conference championship thanks to a few masterful performances from Bortles. And yet, Bortles flunked out of Jacksonville last year, as some analytical experts rightfully predicted.</p>

<p>Can Trubisky improve this year? Sure. Unlike Bortles, Trubisky is still a young buck that has one of the NFL’s better offensive minds coaching him. Maybe Matt Nagy can channel his inner Anne Sullivan and transform Mitch into a functional quarterback&hellip;but my intuition here tells me that Nagy’s efforts will be in vain. That being said, I don’t expect this team to regress as badly as the Jaguars last year. After all, that defense has some spectacular talent. And the Jaguars were special in the way they blew up last year - it wasn’t so much a regression to the mean as it was a catastrophic meltdown. What are the chances of another meltdown happening so soon?</p>

<p>All that being said, another trip to the playoffs is incredibly unlikely for this team, let alone any team with a dysfunctional offense.</p>
