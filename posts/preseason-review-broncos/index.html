<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Joe Flacco, Drew Lock</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Emmanuel Sanders (WR), Phillip Lindsay (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Courtland Sutton (WR), Noah Fant (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Von Miller (DE), Bradley Chubb (DE), Chris Harris Jr. (CB), Bryce Callahan (CB), Derek Wolfe (DT)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>John Elway (GM), Vic Fangio (New HC), Rich Scangarello (New OC), Ed Donatell (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 7</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, only the running backs coach and the wide receivers coach from last year managed to survive the transition from the short-lived Vance Joseph era to the Vic Fangio regime.</p>

<p>Similarly on defense, only the defensive line coach and linebackers coach survived the coaching overhaul. Everybody else has been replaced or had their roles outright eliminated or revised into another role.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Broncos are experimenting yet again with another quarterback this season in Joe Flacco. Unfortunately, Flacco’s better days are far behind him. Joe Cool hasn’t had a successful season for a while. Maybe if Gary Kubiak was still around, Flacco would have a shot at being serviceable. But Kubiak isn’t there and Flacco isn’t likely to experience a resurgence in Denver anyway. Very few quarterbacks, if any at all, see a second wind at this point in their careers. John Elway did draft a quarterback prospect in Drew Lock this year, but it’ll take at least several weeks for Lock to return from an injury on his throwing hand. Honestly though, given Elway’s history picking and signing quarterbacks over the last couple years, I wouldn’t be holding out much hope here for the young rookie.</p>

<p>It’s not all that awful for the Broncos though. The team still has one of the best pass-rushing duos in the league in Von Miller and Bradley Chubb. They still feature a quality ground game headlined by Phillip Lindsay. They still boast the best home-field advantage in the league. And perhaps best of all, they actually have a manageable schedule this year.</p>

<p>We haven’t even addressed the coaching changes yet. Standing on the sidelines will be rookie head coach Vic Fangio, who has had a sensational career in the NFL as a defensive coach. While I can’t speak much about any of his coordinators or position coaches, Fangio’s reputation as a defensive mastermind gives me hope for the new coaching regime here. At the very least, the new coaches should be able to transform a defensive unit that underwhelmed last year.</p>

<p>Despite their quarterback situation, the Broncos have so many positive aspects about them that I project that this team will eke its way into the playoffs as a wild-card contender.</p>
