<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Kyler Murray</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Christian Kirk (WR), David Johnson (RB), Kyler Murray (Mobile QB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Larry Fitzgerald (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>With the exception of a few assistant coaches, the entire coaching staff has been flipped from the top-down.</p>

<hr />

<p>Last year’s experiment failed dismally. This year’s experiment is likely to go down that same track.</p>

<p>Kliff Kingsbury is bringing with him a style of football known as the Air Raid offense. In this system, the pass game is dramatically emphasized, often with 10 personnel sets. Generally, rushing plays are only invoked with audibles. (Often undersized) offensive linemen are spaced farther apart from one another on the line of scrimmage in order to give the passer a bit more time to air the ball out.</p>

<p>Passing plays will (more or less) fall within one of two categories - the verticals play and the mesh play. In a verticals play, four skill players spread out and run deeper routes. One player may break his route early and cut inside towards the middle of the field to create an outlet should the passer be under duress. In a mesh play, the receivers run crossing routes designed to rub coverage defenders off of them.</p>

<p>So the big question here is whether the Cardinals will eventually see success this year following this style of football. I’m not too sure. It’ll take time for a wholly new coaching staff to teach an offensive philosophy that has not been fully embraced in the NFL. On top of that, Kyler Murray is an undersized quarterback playing behind the league’s shakiest offensive line. Things don’t bode well for the rookie unless he’s able to make magic with his legs.</p>

<p>Then again, Chip Kelly was able to find success pretty quickly after bringing his style of football to the Eagles. It took defenses quite a bit of time to finally catch up and counter the high tempo of his playcalling, even though people were long aware of his approach to football before his name was even considered for a head coaching position. And that’s a reality we must heed when it comes to defensive football - defenses can only react to new offensive trends. It’s why innovations in offense tend to go through some sort of honeymoon period in which they seem unstoppable. The Eagles under Chip Kelly, the Rams of the last two years, the Panthers and their exotic rushes three years ago&hellip;all these new-school offenses took the world by storm for a season or two before flushing out. So Kingsbury and his Air Raid offense <strong>could</strong> follow the same trajectory as well.</p>

<p>But then one would have to ask if the Air Raid is really that radical a concept in today’s NFL? After all, it’s obvious the league has been emphasizing the passing game more and more over the last several years. Offenses regularly send four skill players out on routes during pass plays. It could be argued that defenses have been adjusting to this trend for the better part of the decade. The Air Raid philosophy simply raises this emphasis on the air game at the expense of the rushing attack. So one would think defenses would be able to react quick here. Then again, the Rams are effectively running a tweaked version of the Shanahan system and it still took two seasons for defenses to properly catch up….</p>
