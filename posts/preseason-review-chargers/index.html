				<h2 id="tier-2"><strong><em>Tier 2</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Philip Rivers</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Keenan Allen (WR), Melvin Gordon (RB), Hunter Henry (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Travis Benjamin (WR), Dontrelle Inman (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Joey Bosa (DE), Melvin Ingram (DE), Thomas Davis (LB), Casey Hayward (CB), Derwin James (SS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Tom Telesco (GM), Anthony Lynn (HC), Ken Whisenhunt (OC), Gus Bradley (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Remarkably, the coaching staff from last year has been almost wholly retained this season. The only major departure from last year is the assistant defensive line coach, who left to join the Rams as their primary defensive line coach.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Chargers impressed last year, traveling all the way to the division round of the playoffs before bowing out for the season.</p>

<p>All signs would indicate this team is bound to repeat as postseason contenders. Still, I’m not all too comfortable listing them as prospective champions just yet. Rivers has one less weapon this year now that Tyrell Williams skipped town to join the Raiders. Then again, if Dontrelle Inman shows some positive flashes here, Tyrell might not be missed so much.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s the coaching that bothers me. Although to be honest, the coaches stunned me last year by putting together a brilliant game plan against the Ravens in the playoffs. Having faced them once before during the regular season, Los Angeles reviewed the game tape and noticed the Ravens offensive players would show their hand before the ball was even snapped. Essentially, by watching the way the offensive linemen positioned themselves along the line of scrimmage, the Charger defenders knew whether the play was a run play or pass play. Furthermore, the Chargers fielded up to seven defensive backs on the field as part of a concerted effort to limit Lamar Jackson any time he scrambles.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these same coaches were clowned the week after when they ran the same strategy against New England. The Patriots tore apart their dime and quarter defensive packages by rushing the football downfield - after all, lighter bodies have a harder time stopping the run. The Chargers never really adjusted until it was way too late.</p>

<p>Will Anthony Lynn, Ken Whisenhunt, and Gus Bradley be able to step their game up this year? Not too sure. And the offseason doesn’t give me too much to make a sound judgement. One thing worth noting is the high number of pass attempts under which Rivers was in duress last season. It seems the Chargers haven’t done much in the offseason to address that shoddy offensive line, from a personnel or coaching perspective. So if that’s an indication of what to expect this season, things don’t look too great for the Chargers. A playoff appearance is likely, but the conference championships (let alone the Super Bowl) may still be out of reach.</p>
