				<h2 id="tier-1"><strong><em>Tier 1</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Patrick Mahomes</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Tyreek Hill (WR), Travis Kelce (TE)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Sammy Watkins (WR), Carlos Hyde (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Chris Jones (DT), Frank Clark (DE), Tyrann Mathieu (FS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Brett Veach (GM), Andy Reid (HC), Eric Bieniemy (OC), Steve Spagnuolo (New DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 10.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, absolutely nothing has changed. A rarity in a league where assistant coaches typically travel around different teams every year or two.</p>

<p>On defense, however, the powers that be threw Bob Sutton and most of his staff out the door after a season in which his defense ranked among the worst in the league. Which is pretty odd considering the team featured an incredible set of pass rushers last year. Anyway, Steve Spagnuolo now steps in as the defensive coordinator, bringing with him a whole bunch of new coaches to join the three assistants that were kept from Sutton’s administration. It’s worth noting that of those three that managed to survive from last year, only one has a major role this year, as the outside linebackers coach.</p>

<hr />

<p>Much to my surprise, not only was Patrick Mahomes ready for the professional leagues, but the kid went and won himself the coveted MVP award last year. Despite his youth, Mahomes is clearly a top-tier quarterback. Even though he’s bound to regress this year, I have little doubt that he’ll continue playing at an elite level.</p>

<p>Also worth noting is the sudden emergence of that pass rush. Before the 2018 season, I thought Justin Houston was the only pass rusher worthy of mention on this Chiefs roster. But last season, Dee Ford and Chris Jones took their game to the next level and staked their names as premiere pass rushers - Justin Houston ended up being only the third best player on the defense at pressuring opposing quarterbacks. Curiously enough though, the team released Houston and traded Dee Ford during the offseason. On a surface level, one would wonder why the team’s personnel managers would cut loose two of their three best pass rushers last season? But Justin Houston began showing his age last season and Ford only managed to play well last year. It’s no guarantee the latter can continue performing well, especially during a non-contract year. Instead, Kansas opted to spend some cash and draft capital to prune Frank Clark away from the Seahawks. Not a bad move in my estimation, considering Clark has been reliable and steadily improving year-over-year. Honestly, I don’t expect too much of a drop-off this year for the pass rush, especially if sophomore player Breeland Speaks starts flashing here and there.</p>

<p>A quick glance tells me this team doesn’t have too many holes. That patchwork defense from last year shouldn’t be as awful this year so long as Spags can work his magic here. Luckily, the law of averages will be working in his favor - terrible defenses (much like sensational players) tend to regress toward the mean the next year. So it’s likely this Chiefs defense will end up being serviceable, especially if Frank Clark and Chris Jones can keep the pass rush humming this year.</p>

<p>But now here’s the problem with the Chiefs - despite Andy Reid’s tendency to dominate during the regular season, the man finds ways to fall apart during the postseason. His playoff record is riddled with failures and dashed hopes. How could such a great regular season coach fail repeatedly in the postseason? Honestly, there’s no clear answer here, though judging by their conference title game last year, two things in particular seem to stick out - bad clock management and an unwillingness to change things up on offense from time to time. The latter is particularly damning - knowing that Mahomes and Reid love their big pass plays, the Patriots drafted a fantastic defensive plan that effectively silenced Kansas City’s offense for the first half. Sadly, Reid never really properly adjusted during the course of the game, stubbornly insisting on running many of the same plays that carried the Chiefs through the regular season. The problem here is that once opposing coaches successfully decipher your style of offense, your team is left hamstrung if it’s not able to adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>Honestly though, stubborn offensive coaches can be saved by great defenses bailing them out of bad situations time and time again. But the Chiefs were truly abysmal last year on defense - it’ll take at least a few years for this defensive corps to climb to a level high enough to make up for the mistakes Andy Reid inevitably makes in his postseason appearances. Until then, Kansas City will need to be content with another postseason berth that again ends just short of a Super Bowl.</p>
