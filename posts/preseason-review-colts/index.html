				<h2 id="tier-4"><strong><em>Tier 4</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Jacoby Brissett</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>T.Y. Hilton (WR), Marlon Mack (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Eric Ebron (TE), Devin Funchess (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Notable Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Jabaal Sheard (DT), Justin Houston (DE), Darius Leonard (OLB), Pierre Desir (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Chris Ballard (GM), Frank Reich (HC), Nick Sirianni (OC), Matt Eberflus (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On the offensive side, we have a bit of turnover. The tight ends coach and the two offensive line coaches from last year were flipped for new folks. A little concerning considering both position groups were critical in the team’s recent resurgence.</p>

<p>On the defensive side of the ball, everybody was retained. But we do have a new addition in all-pro Robert Mathis, who will be assisting the defensive coaches in training up the pass rushers. Now this is a promising development. The one knock against this team last year has been its mediocre pass rush. Having a legend like Robert Mathis coach the front seven in that area should serve the team well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once again, my thoughts on this team’s prospects last year were just dismally off. I expected this team to be fighting amongst the bottom-feeders as it rebuilds from the Check Pagano era. Instead, the team advanced to the division rounds of the playoffs, losing to Kansas City as Andrew Luck struggled handling the frigid air at Arrowhead Stadium. Frank Reich deserves some major credit for turning this team’s fortunes around - in my opinion, the man should have been given the nod as coach of the year.</p>

<p>Anyway, given that most of the coaching staff has been carried over from last year and that the free agents swooped up this year should be able to contribute positively, this team should be considered Super Bowl contenders.</p>

<p>However, it’ll be hard for them to grab a high seed for the playoffs. The Colts have one of the harder schedules this year. But more importantly, the AFC South is not an easy division to play in - none of the teams in this division can be considered pushovers. Frankly, arguments can be made for all four teams emerging as division champions this season. And without a high seed, Indianapolis may be forced to play in cold environments during the playoffs. As I said before, Luck struggles playing in frigid air, having grown up and played college ball in the temperate climate of California. Then again, if the Colts finally develop a well-rounded defense, that may carry them through to the championship next February…</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>Andrew Luck has voluntarily retired. Tragic too - the young man may have been remembered as one of the greats had he seen his career through to a natural end. But injuries have robbed him of any joy he had for playing football. It was ultimately a decision he made for his own health, above everything else.</p>

<p>In his stead, Jacoby Brissett now steps in as the team’s primary signal caller. And that means the team can no longer be considered Super Bowl contenders. Even the playoffs may be out of reach for the team this year. Fact is it’ll take time for Frank Reich and his coaching crew to mold Brissett into a serviceable quarterback. That being said, that offense still has a fair amount of talent, especially along the offensive line. So Brissett has some help there. And while the Colts defense find themselves undermanned, the unit is not short on fight. So even though the face of the franchise is gone, don’t expect the Colts to be keeling over any time this season.</p>
