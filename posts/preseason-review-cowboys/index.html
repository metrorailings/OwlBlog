<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Dak Prescott</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Ezekiel Elliott (RB), Amari Cooper (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Dak Prescott (Mobile QB), Randall Cobb (WR), Jason Witten (TE), Dak Prescott (Mobile QB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Demarcus Lawrence (DE), Robert Quinn (DE), Leighton Vander Esch (OLB), Jaylon Smith (MLB), Byron Jones (CB), Chidobe Awuzie (CB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Jerry Jones (GM), Jason Garrett (HC), Kellen Moore (New OC), Rod Marinelli (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 9</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, quarterbacks coach Kellen Moore was promoted this year to offensive coordinator, replacing the beleaguered Scott Linehan. Jon Kitna will take over his former position on the coaching staff.</p>

<p>On defense, nothing has changed from last year.</p>

<hr />

<p>I feel silly billing this team as Super Bowl contenders last year. Even though the Cowboys won the division and clawed their way to the division round in the postseason, it wasn’t an inspiring season to say the least. The Cowboys notched too many wins by slim margins last year - take away the game against Jacksonville and Dallas’ point differential for the season dips into the negatives.</p>

<p>A few good things have been done during the offseason. In an effort to turn around an offense that was stagnant for much of the season, the team wisely let Scott Linehan go. Kellen Moore has been promoted in his stead. And promisingly enough, Moore seems more willing to try new things this year, even giving lip service to this idea of letting Dak run around with the ball at times. It was a tactic that was glaringly missing from Linehan’s playbook last year. Still, I do have my doubts about whether Moore <em>is actually allowed</em> to unleash Dak if necessary - I’m not sure if Jason Garrett or Jerry Jones are able to tolerate the risk of Dak sustaining injury as he’s running around the field. Many folks were calling for more scramble plays last year too, but the Cowboys insisted on keeping Dak situated in the pocket.</p>

<p>And really, that leads me to the major issue at hand here - I question Jason Garrett as a head coach. Hell, I even question Jerry Jones as a general manager. Before the regular season even started last year, it was a known fact that the Cowboys were deficient on quality receivers. I thought the team’s brain trust was well aware of the issue and would find a fix early into the season. Instead, it took an expensive trade for Amari Cooper late into November to jump-start the air game. And Cooper, as talented as he may be, is only one man. Coming into this season, this team still hasn’t done much to alleviate their receiver concerns. Randall Cobb was brought into the ranks over from Green Bay, but I honestly see this as more a lateral move given Cole Beasley’s departure over the offseason. The only upward move may have been resigning the aging Jason Witten, though doubts linger about whether he can perform even passably after taking a year off from the game. On top of that, Sanjay Lal still remains the team’s wide receivers coach, despite overseeing a unit that fell far short of its potential last year.</p>

<p>But while question marks still persist on offense and coaching, the defense looks to be solid yet again this year. Consistency in personnel and coaching this year should help the defense settle back quicker into its groove this year. And even though that defensive front only has one elite talent in its ranks, Rod Marinelli seems to find ways to have that defensive line outperform the sum of its individual parts. More importantly, the back seven remains as strong as ever, headlined by the linebacking duo of Leighton Vander Esch and Jaylon Smith. It’s these two that set the tone for the rest of their comrades. Barring multiple injuries to key players, the defense should once again carry this team to a few wins.</p>

<p>So where do I stand here? I see the Cowboys as a middling team that could break into the postseason once more, depending on luck and whether Kellen Moore is allowed to weave more creativity into the offensive playbook. Or maybe it all depends on how hard Jason Garrett will be clapping when his team needs him the most&hellip;</p>
