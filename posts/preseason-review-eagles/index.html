				<h2 id="tier-1"><strong><em>Tier 1</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Carson Wentz</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Zach Ertz (TE), Alshon Jeffery (WR), DeSean Jackson (WR), Miles Sanders (RB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Carson Wentz (Mobile QB), Jordan Howard (RB), Nelson Agholor (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Brandon Graham (DE), Fletcher Cox (DT), Malik Jackson (DT), Zach Brown (OLB), Ronald Darby (CB), Malcolm Jenkins (SS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Howie Roseman (GM), Doug Pederson (HC), Mike Groh (OC), Jim Schwartz (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Win Total:</strong> 9.5</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>The Eagles last season had an odd coaching set-up on both sides of the ball, in that every major position group has at least two coaches overseeing them. Still, for the most part, the major offensive coaches from last year were retained this year, with the exception of the wide receivers coach.</p>

<p>On defense, only the defensive line coach has been replaced from last year, with Phillip Daniels now heading that group. It’s worth noting that former Dolphins defensive coordinator Matt Burke has now been brought on as an advisor to the defensive staff.</p>

<hr />

<p>The injury bug and the Super Bowl hangover depressed this team’s potential last year. It’s possible that Frank Reich’s departure also left a bit of a hole on offense that Mike Groh couldn’t quite patch up in his first year as the Eagles offensive coordinator. Even still, Philadelphia managed to fight their way to the division round of the playoffs before bowing out for the season.</p>

<p>Once again, Philly is stacked with talent. Not all the names listed above will be able to contribute significantly, but so long as some of those players live up to their billing and Wentz remains healthy, this team will be just fine. Speaking of which&hellip;.without Nick Foles backing him up, Carson Wentz is critical to the team’s success this season. Signs are there that the fourth-year quarterback will come through however. Last year, analytical outfits concluded that (despite not having any gaudy numbers) Wentz was actually better than he was the year before in what may be considered his <em>annus mirabilis</em> - his quarterbacking fundamentals and decision-making was so much more solid. Wentz should continue to be able to play at a high level.</p>

<p>One last point worth bringing up is the state of that defensive line, given that it is the heart and soul of this defense. And it thrives so long as snap counts for the linemen are carefully managed and star players are allowed to play at different positions along the line. And despite trading away Michael Bennett in the offseason, the Eagles still have four promising players lining up in the trenches. This should be one of the best defensive lines in the league this year, especially as that defensive backfield has the talent and wits to cover skill players long enough for the pass rush to hit home.</p>

<p>Given how weak the division looks, I expect a good year for Philadelphia. The Eagles should be able to break into double-digit win territory.</p>
