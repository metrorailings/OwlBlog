				<h2 id="tier-7"><strong><em>Tier 7</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Cam Newton</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Christian McCaffrey (RB), Curtis Samuel (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Greg Olsen (TE), D.J. Moore (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Notable Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Kawann Short (DT), Luke Kuechly (MLB), Brian Burns (LB), Shaq Thompson (OLB), Eric Reid (FS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Marty Hurney (GM), Ron Rivera (HC), Norv Turner (OC), Eric Washington (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas over/Under:</strong> 7.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, things have mostly remained the same, save for the wide receivers coach and the running backs coach being new this year. Not sure what the team is trying to achieve in replacing the coaches overlooking the development of their young skill players, but we’ll see later this season whether the changes pay off.</p>

<p>On defense, we don’t see any turnover, but we do see some additions. The linebackers will now be guided by two coaches instead of one. Likewise, the defensive backs will be coached by two people instead of one. Interestingly enough, the new addition to the secondaries staff is Perry Fewell, who won a Super Bowl as the defensive coordinator with the Giants back in 2011.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think going under the win total is a good play here. It’s unfortunate given that the Panthers are hoping for another Cinderella year this season after Norv Turner’s changes on offense showed some positive results early last season. But the reality is that Carolina’s roster deficiencies combined with Cam Newton’s sloppy quarterbacking can really sink the team’s prospects this season.</p>

<p>Starting with the quarterback&hellip;Newton has never been known to be an accurate passer. And that does not go over well in a league where offenses seem to want nothing more than to pass the ball. The one year that Newton was able to perform beyond expectations was a magical year in which teams around the NFL had no answer for the Panthers and their exotic run packages. The sudden emergence of the Panthers that year was also aided by some injury luck as well, as Cam was able to remain remarkably healthy despite his insistence on running head-first into opposing defenders. Outside that season, Cam’s numbers have been rather pedestrian - if anything, it’s his mobility that’s helped burnish his quarterbacking credentials. But that mobility comes at the risk of serious injury, as we saw towards the second half of last season.</p>

<p>It also doesn’t help that his options at receiver are limited. Without Devin Funchess, the Panthers only have so many weapons available to them. Christian McCaffrey should be solid given his fantastic performance from last season, but the wide receiver situation is a bit shaky - whether Curtis Samuel and D.J. Moore can step up as the team’s definitive starting receivers remains to be seen, though the former did post some solid numbers in his sophomore season last year.</p>

<p>It’s not just receiver where the team is short-handed - outside of Eric Reid, the team lacks quality defensive backs who can blanket opposing skill players in zone coverage. And one can make the same argument about that defensive front - outside of Kawann Short, the Panthers lack impactful talent. Wes Horton and newly-signed veteran Bruce Irvin have shown flashes in the past, but neither have demonstrated consistent success before. Mario Addison is serviceable as an edge rusher, but the man lacks the game-changing ability expected of elite defensive ends.</p>

<p>Yes, I tend to pay more attention to a team’s negatives than its positives, but it’s hard to see positives for this team. Sure, it can and will surprise us every now and then. And yes, Christian McCaffrey will continue to impress as a swiss-knife on offense. But nothing else gives me much hope for this team.</p>
