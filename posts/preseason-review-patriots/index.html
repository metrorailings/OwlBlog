				<h2 id="tier-1"><strong><em>Tier 1</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Tom Brady</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Julian Edelman (WR), James White (RB), Sony Michel (RB), Antonio Brown (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Josh Gordon (WR), Demaryius Thomas (WR), Cameron Meredith (WR), N’Keal Harry (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Michael Bennett (DE), Devin McCourty (FS), Patrick Chung (SS), Dont’a Hightower (LB), Kyle Van Noy (OLB), Stephon Gilmore (CB), Jamie Collins (OLB)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Bill Belichick (HC/GM), Josh McDaniels (OC), Greg Schiano Jerod Mayo (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>Staff Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>On offense, the biggest change comes with wide receivers coach Chad O’Shea leaving the team to go become the offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins. Joe Judge, the special teams coordinator, will now be coaching the wide receivers in his stead. Add in a few new assistants and that about sums up the changes on the offensive coaching staff.</p>

<p>On defense, we have a rocky situation. With Brian Flores departing the team to go be the new head coach for the Dolphins, Greg Schiano was hired in the offseason to take over coordinator duties. However, Schiano abruptly vacated his post due to some family issues, leaving the Patriots without a coordinator at defense. Belichick apparently entrusted play-calling duties to longtime former Patriot Jerod Mayo, who actually played with some of the folks on the current roster not too long ago. Whether this move pans out remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The changes on the defensive coaching staff don’t end there, however. We have new coaches this year overlooking the linebackers and the defensive line, Mayo being one of them. The organization also promoted an assistant from last year to coach the cornerbacks now that the former cornerbacks coach left to go join Flores in Miami. It’s worth noting that none of these coaches were fired - all the coaches from last year that left did so voluntarily.</p>

<hr />

<p>The reigning champions can still defend their crown this year. Despite losing a whole boatload of assistant coaches and losing some key elements of their roster from last year, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady will find ways to win games.</p>

<p>A couple things worth watching here&hellip;first, we must see whether Josh Gordon can actually stay active for an entire season. If Gordon can ward off his inner demons and stay active on this roster for the regular season, New England will finally have a receiver that can dominate outside the numbers. Maybe the Patriots wouldn’t even miss Gronk so much, as Gronk was the one player on their team capable of winning against defenders with physicality alone.</p>

<p>Second, we need to see whether the defensive line can pressure the quarterback somewhat consistently now that Trey Flowers is no longer with the team. The Patriots smartly negotiated a trade for Michael Bennett during the offseason though. While the aging Bennett will probably not give the team as much as Flowers would have had he stayed, the man can still play at an elite level more often than not. Furthermore, the organization also brought Jamie Collins back into the fold. Before the Patriots dealt him to Cleveland a few years back, Collins was the best on that team at pressuring quarterbacks. While the wear and tear of football has likely worn down some of his potential, it’s possible that Belichick and the defensive coaches can train him back to notable form.</p>

<p>Third (and most important), we need to see whether Tom Brady starts to slow down. During the Super Bowl earlier in the year, Brady looked every bit like a 40 year-old quarterback. I can’t help but wonder then&hellip;was that a harbinger of things to come or was that simply a blip? Signs seem to indicate that Brady’s still able to ball as a starting quarterback, but I can’t shake this feeling that the man is in the midst of a steep decline. It’s possible that Brady is at that phase of his career where pass protection is absolutely crucial for him to function well. At this point, hits and sacks rattle him more than ever. If opposing defenses can harangue him, Brady could start breaking down mentally. If that happens, that will be the end of this Patriots dynasty.</p>

<p>Even though a few things do concern me, I still have this team ranked as a top-tier team, mostly out of respect to Belichick. It also helps that the Patriots play in a division where all the other teams are still pretty awful. I expect New England to slide into the playoffs with a high seed. Whether they advance to yet another Super Bowl depends mostly on Brady and the number of skill players that show up on offense as reliable vectors.</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>The Patriots were able to scoop up Antonio Brown after he was released from the Raiders. So long as Belichick keeps the rowdy head case in line, the Patriots finally have an outside receiver that can dominate outside the numbers. Pair him up with Josh Gordon and New England may have the best set of receivers in the game today. It&rsquo;s so unfair.</p>
