				<h2 id="tier-3"><strong><em>Tier 3</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>QB:</strong> <em>Jared Goff</em></p>

<p><strong>Known Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Todd Gurley (RB), Robert Woods (WR), Cooper Kupp (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Potential Offensive Vectors:</strong> <em>Brandin Cooks (WR)</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Defensive Personnel:</strong> <em>Aaron Donald (DT)</em>, <em>Clay Matthews (DE), Marcus Peters (CB), Aqib Talib (CB), Eric Weddle (FS), Taylor Rapp (SS)</em></p>

<p><strong>Managers:</strong> <em>Les Snead (GM), Sean McVay (HC/OC), Wade Phillips (DC)</em></p>

<p><strong>Vegas Over/Under:</strong> 10.5</p>

<p><strong>Coaching Turnover:</strong></p>

<p>Zac Taylor, last year’s quarterbacks coach, left to become head coach of the Bengals,. However, with a little bit of reorganization, his role has been taken up by the passing game coordinator from last year. Furthermore, the team added Wes Phillips as the tight ends coach this time around. Not a bad move considering Wes and Sean McVay have some history working together back in Washington and the tight end unit was a point of weakness last year. Aside from those two changes, the offensive coaching staff remains intact.</p>

<p>On defense, the defensive line now has a new coach overseeing the unit. Yet another good move by the team considering the pass rush was another point of weakness last year, despite headlining the defensive player of the year in Aaron Donald. If the Rams had a truly dominant pass rush, the city of Los Angeles would be basking in the glow of their second Lombardi Trophy right now. Whether the new defensive line coach could turn things around remains to be seen, though it’s worth noting that the man has some good experience working with solid edge rushers during his tenure with the Chargers.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Rams were a hot team last year, fighting their way all the way to the Super Bowl only to lose embarrassingly to the Patriots. The team performed remarkably well relative to my expectations - I was convinced the rest of the league would crack their offensive scheme sooner rather than later, effectively neutralizing most of their potential on offense. It wasn’t until the end of the season that opposing teams finally gained a beat on their offense, thanks in large part to Matt Patricia.</p>

<p>Even still&hellip;the Rams are not an easy team to stop so long as they remain fully healthy. Todd Gurley and Cooper Kupp were clearly missed last year - both players do far more on offense than any of the other skill players. Gurley is the lynchpin behind the rushing attack and the short passing game. Kupp is the team’s most critical receiver, period. Without those two players, the Rams were still able to move the ball down the field, but it lacked that crisp quality that really took the league by storm earlier in the year. For this team to keep winning with their current offensive identity, they need some more luck on the injury front.</p>

<p>But then again, the real question we should be asking here is whether Jared Goff can actually take that step forward and stake himself as a truly elite quarterback. Despite his flashy numbers from last season, his success was more a result of fantastic scheming rather than transcendent talent. All things said, Goff ranks as an average quarterback in my eyes. But it’s only his fourth season - there’s still room for him to grow and better himself. So can he do that? Intuition tells me no, but my hunches about this team last year were pretty badly off. So let’s see…</p>

<p>One more thing worth talking about is the defense. By swapping out LaMarcus Joyner with Eric Weddle and Ndamukong Suh with Clay Matthews, the team seems intent on wising up their defense with veteran athletes. If Aqib Talib, Marcus Peters, Eric Weddle, and first-round rookie Taylor Rapp could all excel at press coverage, that would afford Wade Phillips the liberty to blitz more players against opposing quarterbacks. And that&rsquo;s a style of defense that suits Wade just fine. So expect this defense to surge a bit this year, probably as the offense regresses. The extent to which the defense improves and the offense slows down will determine whether the Rams can hold on to the division crown.</p>
