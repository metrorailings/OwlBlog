		<div class='postTitle'>Rams over Cowboys - Post-Game Thoughts</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>Some thoughts on the Rams first playoff win in the Sean McVay era&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Finally, the Rams have returned to their old successful ways from earlier in the season. With a healthier Todd Gurley and CJ Anderson finally brought up to speed on McVay&rsquo;s playbook, Los Angeles was able to pound the ball on the turf for 273 yards.</p></li>

<li><p>Being able to run the ball also opened up that other thing McVay loves to call - the crossing routes. And really, the man coverage schemes that Dallas runs on defense are mighty susceptible to those types of routes, especially if the linebackers are too preoccupied defending the run. As I expected, Jason Garrett and Rod Marinelli were averse to shifting defenders into zone coverage, even if playing zone would have put the defensive backs in better position this game.</p></li>

<li><p>Neither team was able to mount much of a pass rush, but the Rams&rsquo; defensive linemen generally saw more success than their Cowboys&rsquo; counterparts. Aaron Donald had his moments, as did Ndamukong Suh and Dante Fowler. Collectively, the defensive line&rsquo;s best play came on a 4th down late in the game, when Ezekiel Elliott was stuffed at the line of scrimmage.</p></li>

<li><p>Home field advantage is a hell of a thing sometimes. It&rsquo;s pretty clear the Rams were gifted a touchdown late in the game - the referees did not call holding on a Los Angeles offensive lineman that was pretty damn clearly holding a Cowboys defensive end illegally. Had the game been played in Dallas, I think the referees would have been bold enough to throw that flag.</p></li>
