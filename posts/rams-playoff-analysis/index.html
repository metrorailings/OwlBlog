		<div class='postTitle'>Rams Playoff Analysis</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>The Rams stumbled for a bit, but finally righted the ship at the end of the season to claim the second seed in the National Football Conference.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-jared-goff">Quarterback: <em>Jared Goff</em></h4>

<p>Some were making the case early in the season that Goff deserves serious MVP consideration. That case quickly went to shit after the Rams returned from their bye week. With defenses finally having decoded the Rams offensive scheme and Gurley banged up, Goff was largely left up to his own devices to create plays on the fly.</p>

<p>The results were not pretty. Sure, the Rams eked out a win and covered the spread against the scum-tier Lions, but they were blown away in their next two outings against the Bears and Eagles. The young man had the opportunity to build a name for himself and he faltered in the spotlight twice.</p>

<p>So no, Goff isn&rsquo;t elite.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-todd-gurley-robert-woods">Offensive Weapons: <em>Todd Gurley, Robert Woods</em></h4>

<p>Gurley is the single most important member on offense. For some reason, Sean McVay has no confidence in Malcolm Brown, the halfback behind Gurley on the depth chart. I hypothesize this is because he may have serious issues catching the ball out of the backfield. Throughout the whole season, he has only been targeted 7 times in the pass game. <em>Yes&hellip;7 targets over 12 games.</em> Horrendous. Even in those few weeks after the bye when Gurley&rsquo;s health was in question, Todd was still the only halfback on the team catching passes. Things might change a little now that C.J. Anderson has been brought into the roster, but his performance so far this year seems to indicate that his best days were behind him.</p>

<p>Robert Woods is the other weapon that I think the Rams can reliably depend upon. And really, I put Woods on this list solely because I think Goff trusts him the most out of all the other pass-catchers not named Todd Gurley or Cooper Kupp. After Kupp sustained a season-ending injury, not a single receiver has really distinguished himself from then onward. Woods has been the most productive wideout over that time period, recording 387 yards and 3 touchdowns. It also helps that he&rsquo;s the only wide receiver targeted on more than 20% of his routes over that time frame. So his inclusion on this list has less to do with his performance and more to do with his role on the team heading into the postseason.</p>

<p>Frankly, an argument can be made that no receiver belongs to be on this list now that McVay&rsquo;s offensive game-planning has been solved by the better defenses in the league. And it may be an argument I need to take more seriously as we get closer and closer to the Rams division round appearance.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-aaron-donald">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Aaron Donald</em></h4>

<p>The Rams are short-handed here as well. Aaron Donald is <strong>the</strong> best pass rusher in today&rsquo;s NFL&hellip;but the reality is that it takes more than one edge rusher to really set a defense apart in the postseason. Ndamukong Suh and Dante Fowler have failed to pan out as complimentary pieces lining up alongside Donald. Samson Ebukam had a brilliant game against the Chiefs, but nothing much outside of that.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Suh has especially disappointed. Despite some of his gaudy numbers this season, the man hasn&rsquo;t been a consistent threat pressuring the passer. Barring last season, it&rsquo;s fair to say this may be Suh&rsquo;s worst year yet.  There&rsquo;s a reason why the Rams were willing to deal out two draft picks to acquire Fowler from Jacksonville back in October.  Unfortunately, the former Jaguar hasn&rsquo;t done much to justify their investment in him.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>The Rams are in excellent shape here. All the key playmakers have postseason experience dating back to last year. Aqib Talib may need some time to settle into that playoff groove, but he shouldn&rsquo;t have much of an issue, given his history of playing in 8 postseason games.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-sean-mcvay-hc-wade-phillips-dc">Coach: <em>Sean McVay (HC), Wade Phillips (DC)</em></h4>

<p>The wunderkind Sean McVay is definitely a great coach, if simply for making Jared Goff look like an MVP candidate for a couple weeks. With the right personnel, his offensive schemes produces excellent results. Likewise, Wade Phillips is a fantastic defensive coordinator in his own right. Even if his unit has not been anything worth raving about this year, the man holds distinction as a defensive mastermind. So I trust the Rams are in good hands with these two leading the team.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>The Rams have a shot to play in the conference championships. Dallas would be a far better match-up for them in the division round compared to Seattle, but Los Angeles can beat Seattle too, so long as Gurley heals up over the bye week. However, the Super Bowl is still just a pipe dream for this team.</p>
