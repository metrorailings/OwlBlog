		<div class='postTitle'>Reviewing Atlanta&#39;s Loss Against the Cowboys</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>To nudge myself out of the funk I was in Sunday night, when I barely missed hitting a lucrative five-team parlay (may the gods smite Kirk Cousins for the rest of his life), I decided to review game tape from the Falcons loss to the Cowboys earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Two major takeaways&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Matt Ryan found himself flustered by Dallas&rsquo; pass rush, especially when they blitzed. His worst throws of the day came against blitzes.</li>
<li>The Falcons have serious issues bottling up opposing rushers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those two reasons are why the Falcons fell to Dallas. While Atlanta stands little chance of making it to the postseason, it&rsquo;s still worth taking note of their advantages and shortcomings so that we can continue betting on their remaining games this season. Speaking of which&hellip;this Thanksgiving, the dirty birds will be traveling to New Orleans to face off against the Saints&hellip;<em>as 13-point underdogs</em>. Think of that - the Falcons as double-digit underdogs, despite Matt Ryan playing comparatively well.</p>

<p>So the question becomes whether the Saints are likely to cover. And honestly, I&rsquo;d say no.</p>

<p>First off, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Elo spread and the Vegas spread have <strong>finally</strong> drifted apart. It took quite a few blowouts, but the books have finally begun inflating the Saints&rsquo; handicap in anticipation of the public inevitably coming in heavy on them.  So we know the line for this game is a little skewed.</p>

<p>But really, where the Falcons gain an edge here is in pass protection. The absolute best way to stall Matt Ryan is to field a strong pass rush augmented with well-timed blitzes. The Cowboys have the horses to pull that off - New Orleans, not so much. Despite some positive numbers from Sheldon Rankins and their first-round rookie, Marcus Davenport, the reality is that the Saints should be producing much more pressure given that their opponents are playing from behind so much of the damn time. The Eagles from last year are a textbook example of ramping up the pressure when playing with a lead.</p>

<p>Now New Orleans boasts a powerful ground game that will expose the Falcons and their soft run defense. Still, Atlanta should be able to eat as well in this game, making this spread just a tad bit too ridiculous for my liking.</p>
