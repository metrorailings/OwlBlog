				<p>So the first two games are done and I&rsquo;m technically 1-1. While I was <strong>horrifically</strong> off in my assessment of the Colts-Texans game, the Seahawks managed to cover the spread in the last minutes of the game. But in all honesty, I deserve to be 0-2. Had the Seahawks not lost their kicker to injury at the end of the first half, Seattle would likely have lost by 3 points instead of 2 points. Instead, they opted to go a two-point conversion after their last touchdown, as Pete Carroll had no confidence in the backup kicker.</p>

<p>I was initially using a points system to compare teams that were going against one another. That points system hasn&rsquo;t been documented here, but honestly, it was a bit too complicated for its own good. Clearly, it&rsquo;s no good&hellip;the system actually anticipated the Texans to win big today. But come game time, it was the Colts taking the wood to Houston instead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use another system that compares teams to one another among different categories. Each category is equally weighted to one another - no one category takes precedence when determining which team is more likely to win.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to revise my picks for tomorrow using this new system.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="chargers-ravens-3">Chargers @ Ravens (-3)</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/Wild Card Analysis - Chargers @ Ravens.jpg" alt="" />The Chargers and Ravens are fairly even here. Whereas the Chargers claim an advantage here in terms of quarterbacking experience/performance, the Ravens have the better set of offensive weapons as well as home field advantage. The game plans each team draws up will be critical in determining the win. Given that the Chargers are being given 3 points&hellip;I&rsquo;ll go with the Chargers here.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Chargers (+3)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="eagles-bears-6-5">Eagles @ Bears (-6.5)</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/Wild Card Analysis - Eagles @ Bears.jpg" alt="" />By my estimation, the Bears have nothing over the Eagles outside of home field advantage. The Eagles carry two categories here though - quarterback performance and playoff experience. Given that the two teams draw even in every other category, the Eagles should not only cover the spread, but also win the game.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Eagles (+6.5) &amp; Eagles (ML)</strong></p>
