		<div class='postTitle'>Saints over Eagles - Postgame Analysis</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				The Saints have bested the defending champions and have one more game to play before their trip to the Super Bowl. But first a couple thoughts&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>In the 3rd quarter, the Saints sustained a drive that lasted 11 and a half minutes. 11 and a half fucking minutes. It was amazing. It was a grueling crawl down the field, but the Saints were finally able to punch one past the goal line after 18 plays. Philadelphia needs to be admonished here, because the defensive line was completely walled during the whole drive. Had any of the pass rushers hit home just one or two more times, it might have been enough to prevent the Saints from posting 7 more points on board.</li>
<li>That being said, the Eagles&rsquo; pass rushers did have their moments from time to time. Arguably, it was thanks to the pass rush that the Eagles were able to stage one final drive to seize the game away from New Orleans. Unfortunately, that drive ended in a horrendous miscue from their top receiver, Alshon Jeffery. On top of that, the Eagles defensive line was absolutely vicious in the first half, stuffing runs at the line of scrimmage and haranguing Brees on a regular basis.</li>
<li>The biggest thing here is that the Eagles offense stalled from the second quarter onwards. After surrendering two touchdowns on defense early in the game, the Saints must have made a few adjustments on defense. From the second quarter onward, Philadelphia&rsquo;s longest drive lasted only 2 and a half minutes. One of the adjustments I did see happen involved putting the clamps on Alshon Jeffery by having Marshon Lattimore trail him in coverage. Marshon&rsquo;s physical dimensions actually make him better suited to defend jump-ball catchers like Jeffery.</li>
<li>But the reason why the Eagles ultimately stalled is because the offense was not dynamic enough. Even though Golden Tate shined last week, I was right in my initial assessment of him and other depth receivers on this team - Philly doesn&rsquo;t have anybody else that could solidly compliment the likes of Zach Ertz and Alshon Jeffery. Take those two players away and Nick Foles found himself holding on to the ball way too long for his own good.</li>
</ul>
