		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>New Orleans returns back to the postseason after a painful loss against the Vikings last year in the division round. The Saints stand as the top seed in the National Football Conference.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-drew-brees">Quarterback: <em>Drew Brees</em></h4>

<p>Drew Brees is an MVP candidate for a reason. Yes, a few of his games this season have been completely ordinary. But the eye test and the statistics irrefutably validates his status as an elite quarterback. Forget passer rating&hellip;just look at his deep passing statistics - Brees stands as one of only 4 quarterbacks this season to have completed over 50% of his deep passes.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-michael-thomas-alvin-kamara">Offensive Weapons: <em>Michael Thomas, Alvin Kamara</em></h4>

<p>Both players have done more than enough to merit inclusion on this list. Thomas and Kamara have continued performing at a high level after a Pro Bowl year last season. Mark Ingram, on the other hand, has dropped off a cliff. Not only has he lost his status as the team&rsquo;s bell cow at running back, but his receiving numbers have dropped off by roughly 60% from last year. It wasn&rsquo;t just Kamara that cannibalized Ingram&rsquo;s numbers this year - Taysom Hill has been stealing some carries away from Ingram as well.</p>

<p>Generally, I recommend that a team have at least 3 offensive skill players that can be put on this list. The Saints clearly fall a bit short on that, though certainly not for lack of trying. New Orleans did try to work Brandon Marshall and Dez Bryant into the fold, but neither player actually found their way on the field. And none of their depth receivers have been able to contribute consistently. Tre-Quan Smith seems like the most promising pass-catcher on the team after Michael Thomas, but the man has only had two big games this season.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-cameron-jordan">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Cameron Jordan</em></h4>

<p>I initially had some trouble here. While I had little doubt Cameron Jordan deserved a spot here, my dilemma was whether I should include Sheldon Rankins as well. After all, Rankins was statistically the second best pass rusher on the team, tallying 15 hits on opposing quarterbacks during the season. So I decided to watch footage from a recent game where he registered a good number of hits - the game at Tampa Bay.</p>

<p>I saw little from Rankins for the first three quarters. But then the man came alive in the fourth quarter. On the Buccaneers&rsquo; last three drives, Sheldon booked a sack and two hits. Still, his absence the rest of the game worried me. If anything though, another player impressed me at times - Marcus Davenport.</p>

<p>I literally just noticed that Davenport only played in 13 games this season, having taken 3 game off to heal up an injured toe. And from what I read, it seems that toe injury hindered his play style his first couple games back. If you take away the games where he couldn&rsquo;t allegedly perform up to potential, the rookie edge rusher comes away with 12 hits over 11 games. Not too shabby. So if anything, an argument can be made to include Davenport on this list.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>Most of the team that played last year in the postseason will be playing again this year. Only the defense have significant players that will be making their playoff debut in two weeks - edge rusher Marcus Davenport, defensive back Eli Apple, and linebacker Demario Davis. So inexperience will be a trivial matter for this team.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-sean-payton-hc-dennis-allen-dc">Coach: <em>Sean Payton (HC), Dennis Allen (DC)</em></h4>

<p>Payton and Allen have continued marshaling some fine performances from this team. But in talking about these coaches, I want to bring light to something here - it&rsquo;s the ways the Saints manage to win games. Compare the games against Los Angeles and Minnesota here. Against the Rams, New Orleans clobbered them offensively to the tune of 487 yards. That production on offense and some help from special teams was enough to overcome the defense giving up 483 yards of their own to the Rams offense.  Against the Vikings though, the Saints were able to win that contest thanks to a masterful showing from their defense. With the offense performing at a mediocre level, the defense picked up the slack and carried the team to a primetime road victory.</p>

<p>So the fact that the Saints can tick off wins even when one unit underperforms reflects highly on the coaching.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>The Saints biggest obstacle in the NFC are the Eagles. If the Eagles falter for any reason or are simply not playing up to potential, expect New Orleans to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.</p>
