		<div class='postTitle'>Seahawks Playoff Analysis</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>The Seattle Seahawks are virtually locked into the fifth seed of the National Football Conference. Pretty amazing feat given their low preseason expectations&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="quarterback-russell-wilson">Quarterback: <em>Russell Wilson</em></h4>

<p>Russell Wilson has been up and down this season. His performance against the Chiefs last week was a throwback to the last couple years when he was undoubtedly an elite quarterback. But then watch his game against the Vikings and doubts begin to creep up on whether he&rsquo;s losing his touch&hellip;</p>

<p>Given his history though, I am willing to give the man the benefit of the doubt here. Not to mention that data analytics has him pegged as one of the most accurate quarterbacks this season, throwing deep passes with roughly 50% accuracy. His passer rating has been phenomenal as well. So the Seahawks can count on Russell Wilson as a strength heading into the postseason.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="offensive-weapons-chris-carson-russell-wilson-tyler-lockett">Offensive Weapons: <em>Chris Carson, Russell Wilson, Tyler Lockett</em></h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s unsurprising to see two rushers being deemed as the main offensive weapons given that the Seahawks are the one team in the league most committed to the run. With Chris Carson as the bell cow halfback and Russell Wilson as a mobile quarterback, Seattle has been frustrating defenses for the better part of the season with its multi-dimensional ground game. Pete Carroll has been relentless in his journey to bring back that run-first offense from the Seahawks&rsquo; championship years&hellip;.and his efforts have finally bore fruit this season.</p>

<p>But on the other hand&hellip;the strong ground game comes at the expense of the passing game. It&rsquo;s not as prominent as it was the last couple years. And yet despite that, Tyler Lockett is having his best season in terms of raw yardage.  This offense loves its deep passing off play action, and the one receiver that can truly take advantage of those throws is the 4th-year speedster.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="elite-pass-rushers-frank-clark">Elite Pass Rushers: <em>Frank Clark</em></h4>

<p>With the departure of Michael Bennett in the offseason, Frank Clark was slated to assume the mantle of being the team&rsquo;s top pass rusher. And he has indeed lived up to that billing, registering over 24 quarterback hits this season.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, I see Jarran Reed has tallied up quite a few pressures on his end as well. Normally, those numbers would qualify him as elite, but further research is needed. Roughly 40% of his quarterback hits this season came <em>against one team</em>. Take the two games against that team away and the rest of his numbers do not justify top billing. So I&rsquo;ll need to assess him during film study before I&rsquo;m ready to call him elite.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="playoff-experience">Playoff Experience</h4>

<p>Russell Wilson and his team are only two years removed from a playoff victory. On top of that, the team was in the hunt for wild-card seeding last year, up until the Rams came to the Clink and blew the birds out of the water. Most of the players on last year&rsquo;s team has returned this year, so that learning experience from last year&rsquo;s embarrassing loss to the Rams will carry over this year to the playoffs.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="coach-pete-carroll-hc-brian-schottenheimer-oc-ken-norton-jr-dc">Coach: <em>Pete Carroll (HC), Brian Schottenheimer (OC), Ken Norton Jr. (DC)</em></h4>

<p>Pete Carroll deserves massive credit for firing his friend Tom Cable in the offseason. Cable was absolutely ineffective in coaching up the offensive line - his firing was critical towards this team remaining relevant in the post-Legion-of-Boom era. Now that the offensive line has actually gelled under Mike Solari, Seattle has revived that ground game that was so vital to their 2013 Super Bowl run. Being able to run the ball opens up the deep pass, where Russell Wilson truly shines.</p>

<p>The defense is not quite there yet though. Frank Clark has stepped in well enough for Michael Bennett, but the secondary is still a little too green to be considered truly great. Bobby Wagner patrolling the flat has helped the team tremendously in coverage though.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="prognosis-outlook">Prognosis / Outlook</h4>

<p>Worse cast scenario, the Hawks are downed by the Cowboys in the Wild Card. Best case scenario, they lose a thriller in the championship round against New Orleans or possibly even Philadelphia.</p>
