				<h5 id="cardinals-buccaneers-4-5"><em>Cardinals</em> @ Buccaneers (-4.5)</h5>

<p>A little wary of this pick, as Tampa Bay tends to play better against non-division opponents. And really, the Buccaneers should have covered last week against Seattle, which means this spread should be a touch higher.</p>

<p>Still&hellip;Arizona has been remarkably competent over the past couple weeks. Kliff Kingsbury&rsquo;s willingness to tweak his air raid philosophy over the past few weeks and incorporate more rushing plays into the offensive playbook has paid off in spades. Kyler Murray and this Cardinals team have found their rhythm and played well, even putting up an admirable performance against the league&rsquo;s best defense last week. I expect the good times to keep on going, especially if Patrick Peterson and Buddha Baker are out there in the secondary picking off some of Jameis Winston&rsquo;s errant throws.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="falcons-saints-13">Falcons @ <em>Saints</em> (-13)</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of taking the Saints as double-digit favorites, as the team has a habit of taking games off every now and then. But against a hated division rival, I do expect New Orleans to play hard here, especially if the potential is there to run up points against a Falcons defense made out of cardboard cut-outs.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="lions-bears-2-5">Lions @ <em>Bears</em> (-2.5)</h5>

<p>The Bears are just awful. Simply awful. But this Lions team isn&rsquo;t really much better, even though Stafford&rsquo;s commitment to deeper throws has made this offense look better. It&rsquo;s the milquetoast defense that&rsquo;s the problem - the Lions are awful at generating pressure with their front four linemen and pretty predictable with their man coverage schemes. If Nagy can scheme up enough plays to expose Detroit&rsquo;s predictability on defense, Chicago can scrape by here with a win.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="dolphins-colts-10">Dolphins @ <em>Colts</em> (-10)</h5>

<p>Even though Indianapolis has yet to win a game by more than 7 points this season, it seems this would be the perfect game to run away with the points. Unlike the careful Jacoby Brissett, Brian Hoyer is more willing to take chances and fling those home run balls. Those opportunities will be there against one of the league&rsquo;s worst pass defenses, especially if T.Y. Hilton is healthy.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="rams-steelers-3-5">Rams @ <em>Steelers</em> (+3.5)</h5>

<p>It seems a little odd to me that the Rams would be significant road favorites against a decent Steelers team. Yes, Pittsburgh&rsquo;s offense isn&rsquo;t quite the same with Mason Rudolph at its helm&hellip;but then again, has the Rams offense been the same since the Super Bowl last season? I think people here are too quickly falling back in love with McVay after his team posted back-to-back wins against bottom-tier teams.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that the Rams offensive line still presents a liability here, one that can be exploited by one of the league&rsquo;s better pass-rushing units.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="bills-browns-3">Bills @ <em>Browns</em> (-3)</h5>

<p>The Bills ridiculously poor run defense will not serve them well here against Nick Chubb. Now if Cleveland can stop shooting themselves in the foot&hellip;</p>
