		<div class='postTitle'>Week 11 - Solid Bets</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

				<p>All right, so the Supercontest is a lost cause. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m treading water at exactly 50%. Statistically, I&rsquo;m no better than a coin. A fucking coin.</p>

<p>But at the very least, each season offers up lessons for me to internalize. I like to believe I improve as a bettor every year. To be honest though, my best year as a sports gambler has been the first year I&rsquo;ve actually started wagering serious money. Sooner or later, I will eventually match my sensational performance from that year.</p>

<p>Until then&hellip;week 11.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="vikings-2-5-bears"><em>Vikings (+2.5)</em> @ Bears</h5>

<p>The few outlets and NFL writers I respect have all sided with Minnesota here. And I will too.</p>

<p>Mitchell Trubisky is overrated. Analytical outfits continue to trash him week after week, despite his glowing passer rating. Careful observers have noted Trubisky&rsquo;s shortcomings, particularly against the blitz. And Mike Zimmer, as one of the best defensive minds in the game, has a history of exposing bad quarterbacks.</p>

<p>So at the very least, expect the Bears offense to finally stall this week, despite Matt Nagy&rsquo;s best attempts to scheme around a quarterback with limited ability.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="buccaneers-giants-2-5">Buccaneers @ <em>Giants (-2.5)</em></h5>

<p>The Buccaneers are losers. To rack up over 500-ish yards on offense only to post 3 measly points&hellip;it&rsquo;s pathetic. The Buccaneers are a damn mess on offense. Neither Jameis nor Fitzpatrick are serving the team well.</p>

<p>The Giants on the other hand have stepped up their game last week. Sure, Eli Manning was not as impressive as his statistics from last week may imply&hellip;but Eli still managed to finish drives, one of which won the game.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay should be able to score a few times in the game, but I expect the Giants to rack up even more points. Reviewing the game tape from last week, it seems Tampa Bay is happily content playing a soft zone defense. And these defenses tend to be exposed by offenses fielding a solid bunch of receivers. So the Giants have no excuse to lose this game in their quest to win out the rest of the season.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="eagles-saints-8-5">Eagles @ <em>Saints (-8.5)</em></h5>

<p>Seems odd to see the reigning Super Bowl champions be such heavy underdogs. But the Elo model thinks it&rsquo;s well-deserved.</p>

<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m shocked that the sportsbooks haven&rsquo;t set the line even higher, considering the Saints are coming off three consecutive covers against solid competition. I&rsquo;d honestly expect the books to set the line a little higher than usual in order to pull underdog money against such an elite team. Either the books are fine pricing the Saints appropriately or the spread is kept lower than usual to entice bets on a public darling in the Saints. If the latter is the case, that means the books are taking a chance on the Eagles here in this match. And that&rsquo;s a risky proposition in my book.</p>

<p>The Eagles are far from being that team that took the league by storm last year. Michael Lombardi gave me some phenomenal insights in his observations about the team. Last season, the team was converting third downs at an unbelievable clip.  This season, statistical regression finally reared its ugly head - Philadelphia is struggling to overcome third-down from six yards and out. Worse yet, the Eagles cannot run the ball, leading to their offense being one-dimensional. A pass-only offense is not necessarily a terrible thing so long as the quarterback has several weapons reliably catching his passes, but Philly&rsquo;s even lacking horses there. Nelson Agholor has regressed to mediocre form while Alshon Jeffery has been hampered by injury for much of the season.</p>

<p>To be fair, their acquisition of Golden Tate should even things out a bit, but I honestly wonder whether that would be enough to keep pace with the league&rsquo;s hottest team on their home soil.</p>
