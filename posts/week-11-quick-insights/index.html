				<h2 id="texans-ravens">Texans @ Ravens</h2>

<p>Matthew Judon dominating against the run and at taking down the quarterback.</p>

<p>Deshaun Watson seems to be leaning too heavily on DeAndre Hopkins in the passing game. Lots of slants and even a deep heave in his direction on a critical 4th down play.</p>

<p>Ravens&rsquo; defensive line has been a little sloppy with their aggressiveness. One bad penalty sustained an ultimately fruitless Texans drive.</p>

<p>Houston&rsquo;s pass rush is nonexistent, as expected. Mercilus, Reader, nor Brennan Scarlet.</p>

<p>The Ravens and their cadre of tight ends are unique in this league. Mark Andrews catching a touchdown pass against a cornerback demonstrates his value as a pass catcher.</p>

<p>Lamar Jackson and his ability to break tackles is really something special. His patience with the ball also impresses me.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-buccaneers">Saints @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Once again, Brees and Thomas haven&rsquo;t missed a beat with their connection whenever the latter runs flat routes.</p>

<p>A bungled snap from Jameis nearly cost the Buccaneers a possession one yard away from the end zone. Luckily, the sack created additional space for the Tampa Bay offense that allowed Jameis to slide the ball towards a halfback running a post route against a linebacker for a touchdown.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting studying this game to see if the Saints can work out of negative game script given Brees and his penchant for the short ball. So far, one drive ended because of a negative play.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-lions">Cowboys @ Lions</h2>

<p>Jeff Driskel is one hell of a mobile quarterback himself. Not like Lamar Jackson, but still pretty good in his own right.</p>

<p>Driskel&rsquo;s decision-making is suspect. Opted to throw the ball instead of running for what might have been a first-down.</p>

<p>Detroit&rsquo;s defense is just not physical enough compared to this Dallas offense. Jason Witten caught a ball against a defensive back in his hip pocket. Amari Cooper made a catch against a pass that should have been picked off by Darius Slay. Blitzes are just not hitting home. Dak Prescott is breaking out of sacks long enough to throw completions.</p>

<p>Detroit rushing only 3 people on a critical 3rd down is just pathetic. Matt Patricia thinks way too highly of his coverage people.</p>

<p>Dallas is trying to close out this game on an aggressive note, interestingly enough. Dak is handling the ball much more than Zeke.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="patriots-eagles">Patriots @ Eagles</h2>

<p>Dallas Goedert stepping on a big screen.</p>

<p>Philadelphia&rsquo;s secondary is holding up well against the Patriots receiving corps now that they&rsquo;re healthy.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="broncos-vikings">Broncos @ Vikings</h2>

<p>Denver coming out with a creative offensive concept on a shovel sweep.</p>

<p>Courtland Sutton is the man.</p>

<p>Broncos showing confidence in Brandon Allen, having him throw 3 straight times on a goal-to-go situation.</p>

<p>Some fantastically creative play-calling from the Broncos offensive coaching staff. A wildcat play transformed into an end-around that then became a successful passing play. Then Denver ran a similar play right afterwards with mostly the same personnel, but ran the ball this time around.</p>

<p>Defensive tackle Purcell has been a beast against the run for the Broncos.</p>

<p>Two horrible passes from Brandon Allen on red-zone-to-go drives. Second pass resulted in an interception. Dropback football is not his strength.</p>

<p>Broncos defensive line not yielding at all against the run.</p>

<p>Devontae Harris may be a serious liability in pass coverage. Big throws in his direction resulted in a Vikings touchdown.</p>

<p>Vikings adjusted in the second half by doubling Courtland Sutton on key downs.</p>

<p>Denver and their 3-man pass rushes&hellip;..why? You let up a big pass that sustained a Vikings drive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chiefs-vs-chargers-mexico-city">Chiefs vs Chargers (Mexico City)</h2>

<p>Philip Rivers&rsquo; depth of target has been unusually short so far. Though as I write this, Rivers finally threw a deep ball to Mike Williams. That pass was underthrown though.</p>

<p>Rivers just threw an interception on an intermediate throw. Think it might be time for him to retire?</p>

<p>The Chargers&rsquo; rookie left tackle may be a liability.</p>

<p>If the Chargers are to win this game, the win will have to come through the ground game unfortunately.</p>

<p>The Chargers love to drain that play clock for some reason.</p>

<p>Patrick Mahomes with the excellent touch passing.</p>

<p>Chargers shooting themselves in the foot now with defensive penalties, including a penalty that negated a fumble recovery.</p>

<p>Two legitimate pass interference penalties against the Chiefs paved the way for a Chargers touchdown.</p>

<p>Chargers are just a sloppy bunch. Not to mention their defense seems too happy to drop back deep. Though it may be worth noting the linebackers may only be dropping back deep in order to counter Mahomes&rsquo; penchant for the big play.</p>

<p>Pass defense from the Chiefs have stepped up tremendously.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-dolphins">Bills @ Dolphins</h2>

<p>Josh Allen doing serviceably well matriculating the ball through short and intermediate passes.</p>

<p>Vince Biegel of the Dolphins stepping up in defensing the run.</p>

<p>The Bills front seven are shuffling quite a bit around the line of scrimmage, creating confusion and opening up blitz opportunities right up the middle.</p>

<p>Miami is just hopeless at running the ball, apparently. Their wildcat plays, on the other hand, are promising.</p>

<p>Buffalo has been playing pretty aggressive here, even in the 4th quarter up by two scores.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jaguars-colts">Jaguars @ Colts</h2>

<p>Nick Foles did not do a good job of sniffing out a blitz from the Colts. Good job by the Colts, though, blitzing against an overmatched Jaguars offensive line.</p>

<p>The Jaguars are pretty awful at defensing the run. Notably, the linebackers seem easily duped on misdirection plays.</p>

<p>Nick Foles seems too overdependent on DJ Chark to catch his passes.</p>

<p>Leonard Fournette is truly terrible running from a shotgun look. Abandons the inside zone entirely on a handoff from Foles.</p>

<p>Wide receiver screens are a favored play on third downs for this Jaguars offense.</p>

<p>Jacksonville&rsquo;s linebackers are incredibly slow and easy to fool, once again.</p>

<p>Two poor decisions by Foles. Missing open receivers that he should have perhaps picked up on pre-snap. His throws on short crossing routes also tend to be high.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-49ers">Cardinals @ 49ers</h2>

<p>49ers defensive backs are playing off the receivers, almost as if San Francisco&rsquo;s defensive coaches have pegged Arizona is a team known for their deep passing instead of their quick releases and run game trickery.</p>

<p>Sherman failing to adequately cover Christian Kirk on one down led to a big play that put the Cardinals in a goal-to-go situation.</p>

<p>Wide receiver screens are killing this 49ers defense. San Francisco just faced this Arizona squad two weeks ago. Did they not learn anything about this Cardinals offense in that first outing?</p>
