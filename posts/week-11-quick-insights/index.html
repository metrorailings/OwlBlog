				<h2 id="texans-ravens">Texans @ Ravens</h2>

<p>Matthew Judon dominating against the run and at taking down the quarterback.</p>

<p>Deshaun Watson seems to be leaning too heavily on DeAndre Hopkins in the passing game. Lots of slants and even a deep heave in his direction on a critical 4th down play.</p>

<p>Ravens&rsquo; defensive line has been a little sloppy with their aggressiveness. One bad penalty sustained an ultimately fruitless Texans drive.</p>

<p>Houston&rsquo;s pass rush is nonexistent, as expected. Mercilus, Reader, nor Brennan Scarlet.</p>

<p>The Ravens and their cadre of tight ends are unique in this league. Mark Andrews catching a touchdown pass against a cornerback demonstrates his value as a pass catcher.</p>

<p>Lamar Jackson and his ability to break tackles is really something special. His patience with the ball also impresses me.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-buccaneers">Saints @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Once again, Brees and Thomas haven&rsquo;t missed a beat with their connection whenever the latter runs flat routes.</p>

<p>A bungled snap from Jameis nearly cost the Buccaneers a possession one yard away from the end zone. Luckily, the sack created additional space for the Tampa Bay offense that allowed Jameis to slide the ball towards a halfback running a post route against a linebacker for a touchdown.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting studying this game to see if the Saints can work out of negative game script given Brees and his penchant for the short ball. So far, one drive ended because of a negative play.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-lions">Cowboys @ Lions</h2>

<p>Jeff Driskel is one hell of a mobile quarterback himself. Not like Lamar Jackson, but still pretty good in his own right.</p>

<p>Driskel&rsquo;s decision-making is suspect. Opted to throw the ball instead of running for what might have been a first-down.</p>

<p>Detroit&rsquo;s defense is just not physical enough compared to this Dallas offense. Jason Witten caught a ball against a defensive back in his hip pocket. Amari Cooper made a catch against a pass that should have been picked off by Darius Slay. Blitzes are just not hitting home. Dak Prescott is breaking out of sacks long enough to throw completions.</p>

<p>Detroit rushing only 3 people on a critical 3rd down is just pathetic. Matt Patricia thinks way too highly of his coverage people.</p>

<p>Dallas is trying to close out this game on an aggressive note, interestingly enough. Dak is handling the ball much more than Zeke.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="patriots-eagles">Patriots @ Eagles</h2>

<p>Dallas Goedert stepping on a big screen.</p>

<p>Philadelphia&rsquo;s secondary is holding up well against the Patriots receiving corps now that they&rsquo;re healthy.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="broncos-vikings">Broncos @ Vikings</h2>

<p>Denver coming out with a creative offensive concept on a shovel sweep.</p>

<p>Courtland Sutton is the man.</p>

<p>Broncos showing confidence in Brandon Allen, having him throw 3 straight times on a goal-to-go situation.</p>

<p>Some fantastically creative play-calling from the Broncos offensive coaching staff. A wildcat play transformed into an end-around that then became a successful passing play. Then Denver ran a similar play right afterwards with mostly the same personnel, but ran the ball this time around.</p>
