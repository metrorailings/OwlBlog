		<div class='postTitle'>Week 11 - Risky Propositions</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'>
			
				<p>In this series, I&rsquo;ll details bets that are a little risky for my blood.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="panthers-lions">Panthers @ Lions</h5>

<p>Such a beautiful spot for the Lions here. Coming off three embarrassing losses, Detroit is primed to play better now that they&rsquo;ve returned back home and their season is on the line. And last week&rsquo;s game against Chicago shows me that the team can defend against the run when it&rsquo;s a central focus of their defensive game plan. Snacks Harrison manning the nose position has brought their rush defense up a notch.</p>

<p>If the Panthers cannot run the ball with reckless abandon here, Carolina may actually struggle to move the chains, let alone put up points. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a terrible bet to put some money on the Lions here, but <em>Marvin Jones</em> will be ruled out of the game on injury. The offense was gimpy without Golden Tate, but now you take their best receiver off the field as well? Too risky.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="cowboys-falcons">Cowboys @ Falcons</h5>

<p>The Falcons were depressing last week. Matt Ryan loses a step as a passer whenever he plays outside a dome. On top of that, that defense was carved up by Baker Mayfield and his skill players.</p>

<p>Now, the Falcons are currently fielding the league&rsquo;s worst run defense, on a yards-per-carry basis. But in fairness, that dishonor can be attributed to a 92-yard run Nick Chubb ripped off for a touchdown last week. Take away that play and the Falcons would instead be ranked as the tenth worst team against the run. Still, the point is that Atlanta is susceptible against the rush, which should be sweet music to a Cowboys team that rediscovered their ground game last week against the Eagles. If Ezekiel Elliott was able to chew off 150 yards on 20 carries at Philadelphia in primetime, the man should be ready to feast again on a Falcons defense that&rsquo;s equally inept at defending the run.</p>

<p>Then again, the Falcons do have one thing going for them - the fact that the team plays a few orders of magnitude better within the confines of their dome. In particular, take Matt Ryan - his passes see much more air in Atlanta than anywhere else. Likewise, I&rsquo;d think that defense plays with more energy in front of their home crowd. So it&rsquo;s a bit difficult to take a side here, especially when Dak Prescott insists on playing stupid from time to time.</p>
