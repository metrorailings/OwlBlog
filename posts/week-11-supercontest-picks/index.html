				<h4 id="saints-buccaneers-5-5"><em>Saints</em> @ Buccaneers (+5.5)</h4>

<p>Not the biggest fan of taking road favorites, but the Saints are coming off a horrific loss to an opponent that really had no standing to beat them. New Orleans clearly lost focus coming off the bye. That focus should be in place after the loss.</p>

<p>Now cue this game against the Buccaneers. As I noted before, Tampa Bay has a tendency to struggle against division opponents. While I can&rsquo;t say for sure why, it may be related to the fact that division opponents have more inside information about Jameis Winston and his sloppy tendencies. Carolina shellacking the Buccaneers in their second go-around is evidence of this, though it&rsquo;s worth noting that game took place in London.</p>

<p>Regardless, I expect those same struggles to surface again here against a capable Saints defense, even if it&rsquo;s missing the services of its best defensive back in Marshon Lattimore.</p>

<p>The only thing that concerns me is Drew Brees&rsquo; unwillingness to throw deep against this season. It seems age caught up to him. Either way, he&rsquo;ll need to throw deep against a secondary riddled with weak points all over should New Orleans want to win comfortably.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="falcons-panthers-5-5"><em>Falcons</em> @ Panthers (-5.5)</h4>

<p>Does Kyle Allen really deserve to be a 5.5 point favorite against anybody in this league aside from the Bengals? Maybe he&rsquo;ll prove me wrong Sunday, but I doubt it. He still has his issues, though he does tend to play better at home.</p>

<p>But this Panthers defense has been suspect for some time now and I expect the Falcons to put up points so long as Julio Jones can shed James Bradberry off him and Calvin Ridley can step up now that Austin Hooper will be out indefinitely. It also helps that Atlanta is so much better against their division rivals than against other teams - Quinn&rsquo;s approach of spending more time in practice focusing on their division cohorts has paid off here.</p>

<p>Besides, Dan Quinn&rsquo;s recent hands-on approach with the coaching of the defensive line has already yielded promising results against the Saints last week. Even if the Falcons pass rushers don&rsquo;t enjoy the same success they saw in Louisiana last week, it shouldn&rsquo;t take as much pressure to rattle an unseasoned quarterback like Kyle Allen.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="texans-ravens-4">Texans @ <em>Ravens</em> (-4)</h4>

<p>I shied away from this match initially as both teams are too good for me to have any confidence betting one side. But upon further examination, the Ravens have the better head coach, the better set of pass rushers, the home field advantage, and the better overall energy. Generally put, Baltimore is the better team here.</p>

<p>That being said, it does worry me a bit that the Texans are coming into this game with the comeback kid at quarterback and his full complement of receivers. Deshaun Watson has been damn near phenomenal in his short career so far whenever he mounts comebacks. And he could do the same here against a Ravens team trying to salt this game away late in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>Still, Baltimore had experience this season defending against a sensational quarterback in Russell Wilson. That game ended up being Seattle&rsquo;s worst showing this year, as the Seahawks lost control of the game in the fourth quarter. The Ravens coasted to a victory in that match. Maybe the same happens here&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="cardinals-49ers-11">Cardinals @ <em>49ers</em> (-11)</h4>

<p>Give me the elite defense here hurting off a bad loss and playing against a rookie quarterback limited by a playbook built mostly around quick passes and misdirection plays. If the 49ers force the Cardinals to play classical dropback football here, things won&rsquo;t end well for Arizona.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="chiefs-vs-chargers-3-5">Chiefs vs <em>Chargers</em> (+3.5)</h4>

<p>Always a risk to pick against a good team in Kansas City, but the Chiefs are not stout at all on defense. The offense will need to outgun opponents to win decisive matches, but the Chargers are difficult to outgun given their talent on offense, starting with quarterback Philip Rivers.</p>

<p>Besides, I do respect Anthony Lynn&rsquo;s attempts to prep his team to play this game in the high altitudes of Mexico City. Unlike Andy Reid, who seems content letting his team practice as if this were any other game, Anthony Lynn is forcing his team to practice in the heights of Colorado Springs in order to condition them for the hypoxemia that&rsquo;ll hit them as the game wears on.</p>

<p>On top of that, the Chargers taking more than three points makes them all the more tempting.</p>
