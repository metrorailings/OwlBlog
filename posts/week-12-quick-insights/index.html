				<h2 id="giants-bears">Giants @ Bears</h2>

<p>Trubisky plays much better in a high-tempo offense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-patriots">Cowboys @ Patriots</h2>

<p>The Patriots will need to commit more to running the ball, as their passing game is still a mess when throws are not schemed</p>

<p>Cowboys have seen some success running the ball. Nothing too consistent, but it seems like something that&rsquo;ll help them string a few plays together on a scoring drive.</p>

<p>These Cowgirls aren&rsquo;t equipped to play in wet and windy conditions. Their special teams also may present a serious liability.</p>

<p>Patriots pass protection has held up remarkably well now that Isaiah Wynn has been inserted back into the lineup.</p>

<p>A promising New England drive was finally stopped when Demarcus Lawrence and Michael Bennett finally stepped up and killed two run plays.</p>

<p>The Cowboys may have the worst special teams in the league. New England is exposing this unit as a joke.</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy may be the Patriots&rsquo; best pass rusher. I&rsquo;m waiting to see Jamie Collins really make his presence felt. But it&rsquo;s interesting that New England&rsquo;s best pass rushers are not necessarily people that specialize in trench warfare to begin with. Instead, New England seems more inclined to converting linebackers into down linemen hybrids. It&rsquo;s probably the reason why the team decided to jettison Michael Bennett earlier in the season.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="dolphins-browns">Dolphins @ Browns</h2>

<p>A gift of a pass interference call sustained a Browns touchdown drive.</p>

<p>Dolphins doing well limiting Nick Chubb&rsquo;s gains.</p>

<p>Is Miami seriously trying to play New England&rsquo;s style of defense without having any of the horses in the defensive backfield?</p>

<p>The Dolphins are just so bad running the ball. Just so bad.</p>

<p>Negative game script is not something the Dolphins tolerate well.</p>

<p>Just horrific coaching by Miami. The Dolphins tried to run a special teams trick play from several yards out by running the ball. This team isn&rsquo;t trying very hard to prepare.</p>

<p>Jarvis Landry emerging as the Browns&rsquo; best weapon on offense.</p>

<p>The Dolphins&rsquo; revamped pass coverage unit is not coping well with all the different weapons the Browns field on offense. That may be the critical difference in this game.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-49ers">Packers @ 49ers</h2>

<p>The 49ers have a pretty dominant defensive line, if that hasn&rsquo;t been emphasized enough before. Arik Armstead now wreaking havoc in the backfield when he lines up as an edge rusher.</p>

<p>The Packers lack diversity and creativity in their offensive playbook. Unlike Arizona last week, the Packers are not taking advantage of the 49ers&rsquo; tendency on defense to keep their cornerbacks off the receivers. Green Bay&rsquo;s offense should be dinking and dunking their way to points here. Instead, Rodgers is insisting on holding the ball here instead of simply taking what the defense is giving him.</p>

<p>Slants and digs are ripping apart this Green Bay coverage unit.</p>

<p>Cris Collinsworth is a goddamn moron sometimes.</p>

<p>Fred Warner stepping up nicely as the middle linebacker now that Kwon Alexander is out for the season.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Kyle Shanahan is calling the offense aggressively despite being up by multiple touchdowns. Interesting.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="buccaneers-falcons">Buccaneers @ Falcons</h2>

<p>Fuck me&hellip;I just realized that I picked the Falcons here largely because Atlanta is usually so well prepared against its division rivals. With this Tampa team under a new coaching regime, any intel the Falcons gathered before on Tampa Bay have been rendered mostly moot. My assumption was invalid.</p>

<p>Tampa&rsquo;s run defense is for real.</p>
