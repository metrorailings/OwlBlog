				<h2 id="giants-bears">Giants @ Bears</h2>

<p>Trubisky plays much better in a high-tempo offense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-patriots">Cowboys @ Patriots</h2>

<p>The Patriots will need to commit more to running the ball, as their passing game is still a mess when throws are not schemed</p>

<p>Cowboys have seen some success running the ball. Nothing too consistent, but it seems like something that&rsquo;ll help them string a few plays together on a scoring drive.</p>

<p>These Cowgirls aren&rsquo;t equipped to play in wet and windy conditions. Their special teams also may present a serious liability.</p>

<p>Patriots pass protection has held up remarkably well now that Isaiah Wynn has been inserted back into the lineup.</p>

<p>A promising New England drive was finally stopped when Demarcus Lawrence and Michael Bennett finally stepped up and killed two run plays.</p>

<p>The Cowboys may have the worst special teams in the league. New England is exposing this unit as a joke.</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy may be the Patriots&rsquo; best pass rusher. I&rsquo;m waiting to see Jamie Collins really make his presence felt. But it&rsquo;s interesting that New England&rsquo;s best pass rushers are not necessarily people that specialize in trench warfare to begin with. Instead, New England seems more inclined to converting linebackers into down linemen hybrids. It&rsquo;s probably the reason why the team decided to jettison Michael Bennett earlier in the season.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="dolphins-browns">Dolphins @ Browns</h2>

<p>A gift of a pass interference call sustained a Browns touchdown drive.</p>

<p>Dolphins doing well limiting Nick Chubb&rsquo;s gains.</p>

<p>Is Miami seriously trying to play New England&rsquo;s style of defense without having any of the horses in the defensive backfield?</p>

<p>The Dolphins are just so bad running the ball. Just so bad.</p>

<p>Negative game script is not something the Dolphins tolerate well.</p>

<p>Just horrific coaching by Miami. The Dolphins tried to run a special teams trick play from several yards out by running the ball. This team isn&rsquo;t trying very hard to prepare.</p>

<p>Jarvis Landry emerging as the Browns&rsquo; best weapon on offense.</p>

<p>The Dolphins&rsquo; revamped pass coverage unit is not coping well with all the different weapons the Browns field on offense. That may be the critical difference in this game.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-49ers">Packers @ 49ers</h2>

<p>The 49ers have a pretty dominant defensive line, if that hasn&rsquo;t been emphasized enough before. Arik Armstead now wreaking havoc in the backfield when he lines up as an edge rusher.</p>

<p>The Packers lack diversity and creativity in their offensive playbook. Unlike Arizona last week, the Packers are not taking advantage of the 49ers&rsquo; tendency on defense to keep their cornerbacks off the receivers. Green Bay&rsquo;s offense should be dinking and dunking their way to points here. Instead, Rodgers is insisting on holding the ball here instead of simply taking what the defense is giving him.</p>

<p>Slants and digs are ripping apart this Green Bay coverage unit.</p>

<p>Cris Collinsworth is a goddamn moron sometimes.</p>

<p>Fred Warner stepping up nicely as the middle linebacker now that Kwon Alexander is out for the season.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Kyle Shanahan is calling the offense aggressively despite being up by multiple touchdowns. Interesting.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="buccaneers-falcons">Buccaneers @ Falcons</h2>

<p>Fuck me&hellip;I just realized that I picked the Falcons here largely because Atlanta is usually so well prepared against its division rivals. With this Tampa team under a new coaching regime, any intel the Falcons gathered before on Tampa Bay have been rendered mostly moot. My assumption was invalid.</p>

<p>Tampa&rsquo;s run defense is for real.</p>

<p>Jameis throwing a perfect ball on a timing route for a touchdown.</p>

<p>Shaquil Barrett not falling for any of the Falcons&rsquo; play-action.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay starting this game with a number of miscues. A drop by their star wide receiver and two interceptions by Jameis.</p>

<p>The Buccaneers don&rsquo;t seem to care for any of Atlanta&rsquo;s play-action fakes.</p>

<p>Chris Godwin having an unreal game today, even catching Jameis Winston&rsquo;s errant passes.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay&rsquo;s defensive front is dominating this Falcons offensive line in the pass game.</p>

<p>Jameis Winston having a little bit too easy of a time connecting on deep passes against this Falcons zone coverage. And while Atlanta seems to be blanketing Mike Evans with multiple defensive backs, Chris Godwin and other receivers are more or less being released into vanilla zones.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="panthers-saints">Panthers @ Saints</h2>

<p>Panthers run defense is worrisome. Eight men in the box against a very heavy formation and Latavius Murray still ran in the touchdown.</p>

<p>Brees showing so much more of a willingness to throw the ball deep.</p>

<p>Alvin Kamara has not factored much into this game going into the second quarter. The Saints dominating without arguably their best player on offense is noteworthy.</p>
