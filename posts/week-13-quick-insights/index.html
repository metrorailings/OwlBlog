				<h2 id="bears-lions">Bears @ Lions</h2>

<p>The Lions suck. Just something worth noting.</p>

<p>The Bears seem to suck more though. This new quarterback Brough is actually stepping up and making good plays in Chicago&rsquo;s loose zone coverage. Did the Bears&rsquo; defensive backfield come into this match not giving a shit?</p>

<p>The Lions suck, particularly up front. Their pass rush is virtually nonexistant. Despite the Lions&rsquo; hot start, the Bears have posted more yards on offense.</p>

<p>Detroit may be worse than the Giants at defense. I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-cowboys">Bills @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>The Bills have gotten a beat on this Cowboys passing offense. Though once again, the defense has been showing a vulnerability against the run.</p>

<p>The Cowboys&rsquo; offensive front has been a little overwhelmed today, likely because of carefully planned blitzes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-giants">Packers @ Giants</h2>

<p>Green Bay Packers two main cornerbacks like to place zone and stick to the far end of the field.</p>

<p>Saquon isn&rsquo;t that good in pass protection. And his vision as a halfback could use a bit more work, it appears.  Either that or Pat Shurmur needs to let Barkley be the type of runner he wants to be.</p>

<p>Once again, Green Bay does well on their initial scripted plays, then the offense falters very quickly afterwards.</p>

<p>Without the pass rush hitting home, the weak Giants secondary is left out to dry.</p>

<p>On offense, things aren&rsquo;t much better. Bungled snaps followed by a silly throw by Daniel Jones leading to an interception. This Giants product is a mess.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="raiders-chiefs">Raiders @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Seems the Chiefs defense has picked up quite a few of the Raiders tendencies on offense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-cardinals">Rams @ Cardinals</h2>

<p>Cardinals soft-zone defense choked on a third-and-long.</p>

<p>The Cardinals and their soft zone choking even against crossing routes.</p>

<p>I wonder if the Rams defense is keying in on the Rams&rsquo; short passing attack.</p>
