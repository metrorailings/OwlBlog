				<h2 id="bears-lions">Bears @ Lions</h2>

<p>The Lions suck. Just something worth noting.</p>

<p>The Bears seem to suck more though. This new quarterback Brough is actually stepping up and making good plays in Chicago&rsquo;s loose zone coverage. Did the Bears&rsquo; defensive backfield come into this match not giving a shit?</p>

<p>The Lions suck, particularly up front. Their pass rush is virtually nonexistant. Despite the Lions&rsquo; hot start, the Bears have posted more yards on offense.</p>

<p>Detroit may be worse than the Giants at defense. I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-cowboys">Bills @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>The Bills have gotten a beat on this Cowboys passing offense. Though once again, the defense has been showing a vulnerability against the run.</p>

<p>The Cowboys&rsquo; offensive front has been a little overwhelmed today, likely because of carefully planned blitzes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-giants">Packers @ Giants</h2>

<p>Green Bay Packers two main cornerbacks like to place zone and stick to the far end of the field.</p>

<p>Saquon isn&rsquo;t that good in pass protection. And his vision as a halfback could use a bit more work, it appears.  Either that or Pat Shurmur needs to let Barkley be the type of runner he wants to be.</p>

<p>Once again, Green Bay does well on their initial scripted plays, then the offense falters very quickly afterwards.</p>

<p>Without the pass rush hitting home, the weak Giants secondary is left out to dry.</p>

<p>On offense, things aren&rsquo;t much better. Bungled snaps followed by a silly throw by Daniel Jones leading to an interception. This Giants product is a mess.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="raiders-chiefs">Raiders @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Seems the Chiefs defense has picked up quite a few of the Raiders tendencies on offense.</p>

<p>The Chiefs know the Raiders&rsquo; route tree about as well as the Raiders.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-cardinals">Rams @ Cardinals</h2>

<p>Play-action is just throwing this Arizona defense into a dizzy.</p>

<p>Interesting tidbit. The Rams defensive front is purposely stretching their outside arms as they&rsquo;re rushing through the offensive line in order to keep Kyler Murray from scampering out at a sharp angle.</p>

<p>Cardinals having trouble covering tight-ends.</p>

<p>These Cardinals defense is playing soft.</p>

<p>Cardinals soft-zone defense choked on a third-and-long.</p>

<p>The Cardinals and their soft zone choking even against crossing routes.</p>

<p>I wonder if the Rams defense is keying in on the Rams&rsquo; short passing attack.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="patriots-texans">Patriots @ Texans</h2>

<p>The Patriots are gambling with man coverage against the Texans stacked receiver corps. And it hasn&rsquo;t panned out - the Texans burned New England on two separate downs, the latter resulting in a Houston touchdown.</p>

<p>Patriots love to blitz. But zero blitzes only work against inexperienced quarterbacks.</p>

<p>Texans linebacker Jake Martin finally stepping as a capable pass rusher against a good right tackle in Marcus Cannon.</p>

<p>Some sloppy long distance defense and an assignment being missed led to a Patriots touchdown. Still, it seems the Texans may be onto something, assigning a defensive back to blanket New England&rsquo;s halfback in coverage. Without an outlet leaking from the backfield, Tom Brady is left in even more desperate straits.</p>

<p>The Texans may actually have a functioning secondary here.</p>

<p>Deshaun Watson is targeting Johnathan Jones with zest.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="49ers-ravens">49ers @ Ravens</h2>

<p>Marcus Peters having a bad day, giving up a long touchdown and missing a tackle that resulted in a 49ers first down.</p>

<p>The Ravens defensive coaches are drawing up some solid blitz schemes here. These blitzes are throwing Garoffalo off his game. A fumble and several bad throws so far.</p>

<p>Seriously speaking, Baltimore has been holding up very well in pass protection, probably thanks in no small part to the Ravens running game keeping defensive lines at bay.</p>

<p>Lamar Jackson&rsquo;s runs are so difficult to defend. His shiftiness, his speed, his fakes&hellip;almost impossible to counter.</p>

<p>The Ravens run defense still remains very questionable though.</p>

<p>Baltimore is a lot more willing to run offensive plays on 4th down given all their bells and whistles on that side of the ball.</p>

<p>Baltimore&rsquo;s receiving corps are more defined by their tight ends than their actual wide receivers.</p>

<p>Richard Sherman coming and making plays near the line of scrimmage.</p>

<p>Garoppalo hasn&rsquo;t been impressive in this game. A bad decision on third down ended a very promising drive. Not to mention he was bailed out by defensive pass interference on that drive anyway. I think the Ravens and their creative blitzes have warped the clock in his head.</p>

<p>Lamar&rsquo;s read-option runs are gashing this 49ers defense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-colts">Titans @ Colts</h2>

<p>So far, Ryan Tannehill performing adequately under pressure.</p>

<p>This game really does illustrate why quarterback play is so important towards sustaining a drive.</p>

<p>Titans sustaining a great drive with nothing but power runs and screens. Some great conditioning on this team.</p>
