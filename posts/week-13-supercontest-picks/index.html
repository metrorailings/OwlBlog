				<h4 id="browns-steelers-2">Browns @ <em>Steelers</em> (+2)</h4>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel that the Brownies are walking straight into a trap here. Coming off a big win, facing off against a team that it just dominated a few weeks ago (which is now starting a third-stringer at quarterback, mind you)&hellip;the reasons are there to phone this game in, especially with Freddie Kitchens&rsquo; lackadaisical coaching.</p>

<p>The Steelers, on the other hand, should be hyped for this game. After being bullied by these fools just a few weeks ago, emotions are still very raw. I expect the Steelers&rsquo; defensive front to have a hell of a time shredding through Cleveland&rsquo;s offensive front. And if that holds true, Baker Mayfield will be reduced to mush here. On the other side, Duck Hodges will make just enough plays to &ldquo;upset&rdquo; the Browns here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> I was right enough here. Cleveland was actually pretty successful running and passing the ball in the 2nd quarter, but Pittsburgh&rsquo;s defensive front landed some hits on Baker Mayfield, one of which rendered his hand numb for the second half. Anyway, it was these constant hits that won the game for the Steelers.</p>

<p>Although&hellip;it also helps that the Duckster was able to launch a few deep balls thanks largely to Cleveland&rsquo;s poor pass rush affording him so much time in the pocket.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="redskins-panthers-10">Redskins @ <em>Panthers</em> (-10)</h4>

<p>Should I really pick middling teams as double-digit favorites? I guess we&rsquo;ll find out.</p>

<p>One thing to be said about Washington&hellip;.the Redskins are awful. <em>Just awful</em>. Nothing sums up their commitment to sucking ass better than their rookie quarterback, Dwayne Haskins. If the Panthers can rack up quarterback hits here and force some turnovers, Carolina can cover this spread.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong>  While I haven&rsquo;t seen this game and I doubt I will, I just want to note that the Panthers being unable to stop the only thing the Redskins do somewhat well on offense is disheartening. It&rsquo;s a stark reminder not to bank on middling teams as double-digit favorites.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="49ers-ravens-6"><em>49ers</em> @ Ravens (-6)</h4>

<p>From an Elo standpoint, the Ravens&rsquo; ranking is inflated. After that big win, this spread literally jumped up 2 to 3 points in their favor. A little bit too much of a jump given that the 49ers are one of the three best teams in this league. Their defense can certainly limit Lamar Jackson&rsquo;s production here.</p>

<p>The real question here is whether the 49ers can post points against a Ravens defense that has stepped up quite a bit over the past few weeks. And while I don&rsquo;t have too much faith in Jimmy Garoppalo dropping back with the football, I do trust Kyle Shanahan to find ways to scheme big plays to keep his team in contention.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> The 49ers were able to pull off the cover, thanks to some courageous play and some opportune fumbles. Still, watching the game leaves me wondering whether this was such a solid pick. The Ravens played like the better team in my eyes. San Francisco was unable to goad and harass Lamar as much as I initially assumed. On top of that, the Ravens were constantly making fools out of the front with their trick runs. In the end, I think the weather has as big a role here in my win as the 49ers offense did running the ball for over 150 yards.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="titans-colts-2-5"><em>Titans</em> @ Colts (-2.5)</h4>

<p>Indianapolis has been getting by this season thanks mostly to solid coaching and stellar offensive line play. However, without T.Y. Hilton and Marlon Mack,  the Colts will be relying on Eric Ebron, Jonathan Williams, and Zach Pascal to step up on offense. I&rsquo;m not sure those three are enough to notch points against a respectable Tennessee defense playing better now that a capable quarterback has brought life back into their offense.</p>

<p>If Tennessee can force some ugly throws and movements out of Jacoby Brissett, the cover and upset is pretty much guaranteed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> You know, if the Colts had a competent kicker, a win wouldn&rsquo;t have been too far out of reach though.</p>

<p>But they don&rsquo;t have one. And I knew that before the game. And without their star skill players, Indy&rsquo;s drives tended to end a good bit short of the end zone. It would only be so long before Derrick Henry and Ryan Tannehill would find their sea legs against a Colts defense that was wearing down over the game.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="rams-cardinals-3">Rams @ <em>Cardinals</em> (+3)</h4>

<p>Typically, I shy away from stock low situations, but the Rams are just awful, what with their offensive scheme having been decoded and Jared Goff flailing wildly behind an offensive line not affording him much protection. Los Angeles lost any sort of magic they had last year on offense.</p>

<p>The Cardinals, on the other hand, have been playing better and better with as the season progresses.  Kliff Kingsbury&rsquo;s willingness to modify his air raid strategy has paid off in dividends - Kyler Murray and the offense have been surprisingly productive the last several games. On defense, the team seems to be playing better too, led by their star players in Chandler Jones, Terrell Suggs, Patrick Peterson, and Budda Baker.</p>

<p>Given 3 points here, I&rsquo;ll side with the team showing more promise, even if this smells like a trap line.</p>

<p><strong><em>Postmortem:</em></strong> The Cardinals came out of their bye still half-asleep. If you manage a defense ranked near the bottom of the league, you&rsquo;d probably serve your team well spiking their coffees in the mornings following bye week. Instead, Arizona&rsquo;s defense barely showed up here as the Rams posted a record day on offense.</p>

<p>On second thought though, maybe it&rsquo;s not that shocking that Arizona came out so limp in this outing, given Kliff is still learning the ropes as an NFL head coach.</p>
