				<h2 id="buccaneers-lions">Buccaneers @ Lions</h2>

<p>Josh Wells a liability as a replacement left tackle for Tampa Bay.</p>

<p>Detroit Lions actually blitzed for once and managed to secure an interception off that blitz.</p>

<p>The Lions are so bad in their defensive backfield, I love it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bears-packers">Bears @ Packers</h2>

<p>The Packers truly have one of the best offensive lines in the league. Their pass-blocking and run-blocking has been stellar this week and last week.</p>

<p>Great throw by Aaron Rodgers for the team&rsquo;s first touchdown, though the jury is still out on whether he can still be considered an elite quarterback this season.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="seahawks-panthers">Seahawks @ Panthers</h2>

<p>The Seahawks game plan is fairly simple here. Power runs with bootleg play-fakes peppered into the offense every now and then.</p>

<p>But the Panthers are playing the run fairly well. Maybe yet more proof that it&rsquo;s easier for a bad defense to guard against good rushers than it is for a good offense to rush the ball against a bad defense.</p>

<p>These Seahawks skill players seem a tad bit slow. Even Tyler Lockett, who made a great move to shake off a trailing defender, only to be stopped just a few yards later.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-cowboys">Rams @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>Of course the Cowboys are developing a rhythm on offense, courtesy of their offensive line dominating the Rams defensive front in the ground game. The Rams are having a real hard time bringing Elliott down quickly.</p>

<p>Aaron Donald may be the only elite defensive linemen on the Rams, considering none of the other lineman are having much of an impact at defensing the run.</p>

<p>Maybe the lesson here is that the Rams play abnormally well against division opponents. Their true worth can only be measured against teams they do not play often.</p>

<p>Once again, Goff is trash playing dropback football. The Rams need him to settle into a rhythm for the offense to see any success.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-steelers">Bills @ Steelers</h2>

<p>Josh Allen loves holding his balls.</p>

<p>Bold coaching by Sean McDermott paying off with a touchdown.</p>

<p>Nobody on the Bills defensive line really standing out, though Shaq Lawson looks to have potential.</p>

<p>McDermott loves checking out pre-snap formations and then taking timeouts, if only to gain even more intel on the opponent.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-chargers">Vikings @ Chargers</h2>

<p>Danielle Hunter is truly an elite defensive linemen. I still need time to assess whether Linval Joseph or Everson Griffen belong in the same club though. Next week&rsquo;s match against the division leader Packers will be instructive in this regard.</p>

<p>The Vikings on offense thrive off the rushing threat posed by Dalvin Cook. Lots of 12-personnel alignments to draw opposing defenders towards the line of scrimmage. I suspect a simple box count more often than not determines whether Kirk Cousins rolls out for play-action or hands the ball off to Dalvin Cook so he can work his way north.</p>

<p>The true test for Kirk Cousins comes when Dalvin Cook cannot be counted on anymore due to injury. I wonder how he holds up. More research is needed here.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="colts-saints">Colts @ Saints</h2>

<p>Once again the Saints letting up yardage on intermediate and deep crossers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="texans-titans">Texans @ Titans</h2>

<p>The Texans pass coverage has taken a serious step up from its dreadful preseason form.</p>

<p>Interesting power running from the Titans. Their receivers sometimes line up next to the offensive line in a no-point stance only to end up blocking for Derrick Henry right alongside the rest of the offensive line.</p>
