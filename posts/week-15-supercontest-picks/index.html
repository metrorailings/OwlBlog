				<h4 id="buccaneers-lions-3"><em>Buccaneers</em> @ Lions (+3)</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to trust Jameis here, especially given that he&rsquo;s without his favorite weapon in Mike Evans. Still, Jameis did all right last week when Evans had to leave early.  Things would have been much better if he didn&rsquo;t throw three ugly interceptions against the Colts and their zone defense.</p>

<p>It helps that the Lions almost exclusively play man coverage here, as it limits opportunities for interceptions. And even if interceptions are made, return yardage will be kept to a minimum.</p>

<p>If Jameis has enough opportunities, he&rsquo;ll sling the ball all over this Lions defense and secure a good win here.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="texans-titans-3"><em>Texans</em> @ Titans (-3)</h4>

<p>The Titans have been rolling lately, whereas the Texans lost ugly to a Denver team starting a rookie quarterback. But that&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;rookie quarterbacks have the surprise factor going for them in that there&rsquo;s so little footage on them. That and the Broncos have a solid cast of playmakers on offense that a young quarterback can rely on for help.</p>

<p>Then again, does it even matter? O&rsquo;Brien just had one of the biggest wins in his career. Could he really bring himself to give a damn about a team that was more than a touchdown underdog? Doubtful. So mix this apathy from the Texans coaching staff with the uncertainty that comes when a rookie quarterback starts games and you had the recipe for a sick upset.</p>

<p>In other words, the Texans are nowhere near as bad as their loss last week. Houston can still throw and run the ball fairly well. And both of those will help keep them in contention here against a Titans defense that&rsquo;s more middling than I originally thought.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="seahawks-panthers-6-5"><em>Seahawks</em> @ Panthers (+6.5)</h4>

<p>The Panthers suck. The Seahawks need a win. And this game seems like Michael Lombardi&rsquo;s favorite play this week.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="rams-cowboys-1"><em>Rams</em> @ Cowboys (+1)</h4>

<p>It scares me that so many people are riding the Rams here. But a soft forensic analysis justifies my love for the Rams here. Give me a good team as slight favorites against another team that&rsquo;s been underwhelming the past few weeks.</p>

<p>Can the Cowboys win? Yes they can. It&rsquo;s going to take some solid coaching and inspiration though. Having gotten to know Jason Garrett over the past couple years though, I&rsquo;m pretty comfortable betting against him.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="colts-saints-8"><em>Colts</em> @ Saints (-8)</h4>

<p>Way too many points being given to a good team here. Yes, the Colts are not great, but they&rsquo;re not bad enough to justify this spread, even with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback. I&rsquo;m hoping Frank Reich&rsquo;s offensive genius can find a way to simulate some of the success the 49ers saw last week on offense.</p>
