				<h2 id="texans-buccaneers">Texans @ Buccaneers</h2>

<p>Jameis getting steadily better, though his turnover rate is still ridiculous.</p>

<p>Texans still have no viable pass rush without JJ Watt.</p>

<p>Houston actually has some quality pass coverage personnel, though this is Jameis we&rsquo;re talking about. Let&rsquo;s see how they perform against actual competition come playoff time.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bills-patriots">Bills @ Patriots</h2>

<p>Bills are being gashed on the ground for steady yardage.</p>

<p>Some creative play-calling by the Patriots offense, throwing a ball to N&rsquo;Keal Harry running a wheel route after play action.</p>

<p>Patriots making hay with heavy run formations here peppered with passes here and there. Good play-calling by Josh McDaniels.</p>

<p>Kyle Van Noy only down lineman on either team having any impact on this game, even if only on one play.</p>

<p>Dont&rsquo;a Hightower managed to create pressure on a 3rd down.</p>

<p>Bills still insisting on singular man coverage on Julian Edelman.</p>

<p>I notice the Patriots chipping one of the Bills defensive lineman. Probably Shaq Lawson? Jerry Hughes?</p>

<p>Jordan Phillips creating a negative play for the Bills here with a run stuff.</p>

<p>Jerry Hughes and Dont&rsquo;a Hightower stepping up in their pass rush.</p>

<p>Bills are finally stopping Patriot drives now that they&rsquo;re occasionally doubling Julian Edelman.</p>

<p>Patriot insisted on running man coverage, even on an end-of-half drive. That insistence cost them a touchdown.</p>

<p>Lots of double-clutching by Josh Allen. Seems to indicate uncertainty and a failure to read the coverage properly.</p>

<p>Shaq Lawson made solid reads on 2 of the Patriots misdirection plays, stopping these plays early in the backfield.</p>

<p>Bills have some serious issues overall with tackling.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="steelers-jets">Steelers @ Jets</h2>

<p>Holy hell, Mason Rudolph is back at quarterback. Duck Hodges may have been benched. Lord help us.</p>

<p>Gregg Williams&rsquo; zone blitzes making mincemeat of these Steelers quarterbacks.</p>

<p>Boswell is still kicking well.</p>

<p>Ah, Steelers running prevent zone at the end of the half. Fantastic&hellip;.</p>

<p>TJ Watt&rsquo;s huge strip sack leading to a touchdown for the Steelers on a bomb from Mason Rudolph. Not bad.</p>

<p>I think Williams defensive style is the real winner here. Jamal Adams being back also helped. But the Steelers offense was absolutely gutted here by the Jets and their confusing formations. Veteran quarterbacks can dissect the offense, but young inexperienced quarterbacks are left hapless.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="saints-titans">Saints @ Titans</h2>

<p>Titans still commit hard to their play-action heavy offense, even without their bellcow in Derrick Henry. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, as defenses still bite against the fake rush and Tannehill is still doing a fantastic job connecting with his skill players. I honestly wonder if Tannehill can be considered elite.</p>

<p>The Saints and Sean Payton finding ways to get Michael Thomas matched up in single coverage&hellip;.well done.</p>

<p>A zone blitz using the man cornerback covering Michael Thomas was an ill-advised move.</p>

<p>Excellent improvisational play from Ryan Tannehill to create a touchdown from a busted screen play.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-vikings">Packers @ Vikings</h2>

<p>Cousins not doing well enough in a big moment here. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Vikings aren&rsquo;t running as much play action here, forcing Cousins to play dropback football here.</p>

<p>Danielle Hunter is easily the Vikings best defensive lineman. And on the other side, we have Za&rsquo;Darius Smith as the Packers best down lineman.</p>

<p>Aaron Rodgers seems to only really connect with DaVonte Adams and Allen Lazard, at least so far.</p>

<p>A second quarter Packers drive summed up their offense quite well. Quick throws to Davante Adams paired with runs by Jamal Adams and not much else. Aaron Rodgers failed to improvise on two separate opportunities in the red zone, once again making me wonder whether Rodgers can be considered an elite quarterback this season.</p>

<p>Allen Lazard failed to reel in a big throw. Disappointing.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cardinals-seahawks">Cardinals @ Seahawks</h2>

<p>Rasheem Greene another name to watch on this Seahawks defensive line.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-eagles">Cowboys @ Eagles</h2>

<p>Carson Wentz and his mobility has sustained a few drives.</p>

<p>Dallas Goedert stepping up as a viable catching option.</p>

<p>Wentz missing a screen pass that could have closed the game. Worrisome.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="chiefs-bears">Chiefs @ Bears</h2>

<p>Tyreek Hill is the team&rsquo;s best receiver, though Travis Kelce is a very close second. The real question here for the Chiefs offense is whether they have a reliable third vector on offense. It could be the quarterback&rsquo;s mobility, it could be Shady and the run game, or it could be a second X receiver like Sammy Watkins.</p>

<p>The Chiefs have some of the best route concepts I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
