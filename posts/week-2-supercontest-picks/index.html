				<h4 id="49ers-bengals-2-0">49ers @ <em>Bengals</em> (-2.0)</h4>

<p>Kind of weird for me to go with a team that I ranked as a dreg-tier team before the season. But Cincinnati truly impressed me last week, going up to the Clink to face off against a Seattle defense that prepped well for a McVay-style offense. Instead, the Bengals offense seems to have developed its own identity, one that suits Andy Dalton from what I saw last week. The Bengals are a far better team than I thought them to be - to my chagrin, coach Zac Taylor seems to know what he’s doing. I expect them to punk this underperforming 49ers team.</p>

<h4 id="colts-titans-3"><em>Colts</em> @ Titans (-3)</h4>

<p>I don’t think all that much of the Titans smacking around the Browns last week. What concerns me about Tennessee here is that Derrick Henry is the focal point of their offense, instead of Marcus Mariota. It tells me quite a bit about what the coaches think of their young signal caller. In contrast, the Colts look as if they’re comfortable with Jacoby Brissett under center. I think Frank Reich’s dominance of these Titans will not be stopped in this game.</p>

<h4 id="seahawks-steelers-4">Seahawks @ <em>Steelers</em> (-4)</h4>

<p>It’s hard for me to initially side with these Steelers after their dismal showing last week against the Patriots. But the Seahawks weren’t that much better in their own game against the Bengals. It still looks to me that Seattle is still developing an identity on offense that maximizes the contributions of their noteworthy skill players. And they’re taking their sweet time figuring things out too unfortunately. Given Pittsburgh’s history of turning things around fairly quickly, I expect the Steelers offense to see more success here than Seattle’s. Playing on their home turf will also help Pittsburgh settle into a groove quicker.</p>

<h4 id="bears-broncos-2-5">Bears @ <em>Broncos</em> (+2.5)</h4>

<p>Nobody should know Mitch Trubisky’s little quirks and tendencies better than the defensive coordinator that sparred with him in practice for the last two years. Combine that with the thin air of Mile High Stadium and the Bears offense should put forth another hopeless performance this season. So long as Flacco keeps his incontinence under control on a few drives, Denver can put up just enough points to steal a win here.</p>

<h4 id="saints-rams-2-5"><em>Saints</em> @ Rams (-2.5)</h4>

<p>The Rams played terribly last week. Makes me wonder if the last Super Bowl actually exposed their weaknesses to the rest of the league. Either way, the team still has one of the best coaches in the league in Sean McVay. But I would argue the Saints have a better coach in Sean Payton. That, the revenge angle, and the fact that Drew Brees is much better than Jared Goff has me siding with the Saints. Taking the points is nice too.</p>
