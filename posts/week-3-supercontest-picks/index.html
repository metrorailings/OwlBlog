				<h2 id="ravens-chiefs-6-5">Ravens @ <em>Chiefs</em> (-6.5)</h2>

<p>I initially sides with the Ravens here, especially as 7-point underdogs. But a bit more probing into this match-up and I uncovered a few things that worried me. One, Lamar Jackson is playing almost too well as a passer given his performance from last year. The man is due for regression soon, and what better place to regress than a stadium famed for exposing quarterbacks playing far above their pay grade. Two, the Ravens pass defense showed some vulnerabilities last week against the Cardinals and their Air Raid attack. It makes sense, given that great defenses one year almost always regress the following year. The Ravens defense this year was bound to lose some of its teeth, having lost major players at all levels of the defense to free agency or injury. And that makes things easier for Patrick Mahomes and all of his weapons. Speaking of which, it&rsquo;s also worth noting that this is the home opener for the Chiefs.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="raiders-vikings-8-5">Raiders @ <em>Vikings</em> (-8.5)</h2>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this a great game for the Vikings? Exactly one of those games where the Vikings make a statement following an embarrassing loss to a bitter rival. And the Raiders are the perfect team to crush into a pulp too, what with the team being bottom-tier league fodder. Too many things are going in the Vikings favor here, making Minnesota a tempting pick despite the high spread.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="steelers-49ers-6-5"><em>Steelers</em> @ 49ers (-6.5)</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little worrying to side with Pittsburgh here given that the 49ers are playing in their home opener here. It&rsquo;s all the more worrying when the Steelers are starting an untested quarterback while San Francisco is fielding an offense that just dropped 40 points the week before. But once again, I have faith in Mike Tomlin and his coaching staff will make some bold moves here to keep Pittsburgh competitive in this game.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Shanahan&rsquo;s offense can be stopped so long as defenders remain disciplined and their rushing game can be stunted. While the Steelers lost some of their composure late last week against the Seahawks, Pittsburgh still managed to keep things close.</p>

<p>Not to mention Pittsburgh does have an ace card here - the surprise factor involved when a new quarterback is thrusted into a starter role. Defensive coaches don&rsquo;t have much game footage on Mason Rudolph, so it&rsquo;ll be hard getting a beat on the young man&rsquo;s tendencies and habits.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="panthers-cardinals-3"><em>Panthers</em> @ Cardinals (-3)</h2>

<p>Like the Steelers, the Panthers are starting an untested quarterback on the road, albeit against a different NFC West club. Still, I feel better about this pick compared to the Pittsburgh pick, even though Carolina is only being given three points here.</p>

<p>The reality is that this Arizona team is still developing an identity on offense. Kliff Kingsbury is still feeling his way around as a rookie head coach, given all the mistakes he made last week against the Ravens.</p>

<p>The Panthers, on the other hand, are a desperate team still looking for their first victory of the season. I think that desperation is the extra juice they need to win this game outright. Not to mention the surprise factor involved whenever a team starts a new quarterback that doesn&rsquo;t have much footage out there that can be studied.</p>

<p>One thing worth noting before I close this out&hellip;Kawann Short is questionable. As the best pass rusher on the team, Short is absolutely critical here to the Panthers&rsquo; chances of winning this game. Carolina&rsquo;s secondary is nowhere near competent enough to keep the Cardinals&rsquo; air raid under control. The Panthers need to harass Kyler Murray on a regular basis if they want to cap Arizona&rsquo;s offense.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rams-browns-3"><em>Rams</em> @ Browns (+3)</h2>

<p>Against my own personal inclination to see the Browns win a major primetime game here, give me the more cohesive team here with the better coaches and the experience of having played so many spotlight games over the past couple years. Jared Goff&rsquo;s pedestrian quarterbacking gives me some pause here, but it&rsquo;s not like Baker Mayfield has been lighting the world on fire this season. Not to mention losing a major weapon like David Njoku will hurt this offense - it robs them of a vector on offense.</p>
