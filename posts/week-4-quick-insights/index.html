				<h2 id="jaguars-broncos">Jaguars @ Broncos</h2>

<p>Jaguar linebackers not playing disciplined against misdirection plays.</p>

<p>Jacksonville doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much of a red zone playbook.</p>

<p>Jalen Ramsey&rsquo;s understudy not doing all too well. But in his defense, the Broncos were able to move the ball on him thanks largely to some well-drawn plays.</p>

<p>Those plays involved wide receivers running crossing routes on third down in order to create space for a halfback coming out of the backfield, running play-action off a heavy formation, and then motioning a tailback away from the pocket in order to create a throwing lane up the seam for Flacco.</p>

<p>The Jaguars&rsquo; offensive tackles are points of weakness.</p>

<p>Fournette was able to chew off some serious yardage early in the second half behind the I-formation fullback runs.</p>

<p>Minshew is magical with his elusiveness in the pocket.</p>

<p>Timely zone blitz by the Jaguars to end a critical Broncos drive.</p>

<p>Minshew magic is a real thing. This whole team ups its game when Minshew magic is in effect.</p>

<p>Zone blitzes throw off the Broncos and their attempt to dump off passes to leaking halfbacks.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cowboys-saints">Cowboys @ Saints</h2>

<p>The Saints should have a hard time running their offense from a negative game script, given Bridgewater is more a game manager than anything else.</p>
