		<div class='postTitle'>Week 5 Supercontest Picks</div>
		<div class='headerUnderline'></div>

		<div class='postBody'><p>A 3-2 result last week&hellip;not too shabby. It could have been a 5-0 had a couple plays rolled out a bit better for me! But then again, the 3-2 record was justified to be frank. I try to avoid picking games where the outcome of the game (relative to the spread) is still uncertain in its final minutes.</p>

<p>The real sharps should be picking games where a resolution is comfortably reached well before the game ends. And I was able to do that on three different instances last week, thankfully. I feel as if I&rsquo;m getting my mojo back.</p>

<p>This week though&hellip;it&rsquo;s going to be a little difficult. I feel very confident <strong>only</strong> in two of my picks.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="denver-broncos-new-york-jets-1">Denver Broncos @ <em>New York Jets (-1)</em></h5>

<p>Quite a few people were shocked when this line was initially revealed. How could a fairly promising team like the Broncos be one-point underdog against a Jets team that&rsquo;s been humiliated three damn weeks in a row? Even my Elo model has the Jets pinned as slim underdogs.</p>

<p>Well, here&rsquo;s one of the reasons why - teams that have sustained consecutive losses are more likely to bounce back, provided the spot is right. And this spot should be right. Denver has to travel across two time zones on a short week for an early afternoon game. So I do not expect the Broncos to be playing at full potential, especially coming off a big primetime showing against a division rival.</p>

<p>On a bit of a different note, this Broncos team disappoints me for a couple different reasons. One, the team&rsquo;s head coach and its offensive coordinator have failed to field a serviceable offense for the past year and a half, which is unacceptable given that they have a proven commodity at quarterback. Second, Von Miller has had two consecutive games now where he&rsquo;s failed to do much. It&rsquo;s beginning to worry me, considering he&rsquo;s supposed to be a first-class edge rusher. Maybe those two games were just a blip&hellip;or maybe those two games were indicative that something is off with Von Miller this year. This game will determine which of those two statements is true.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="los-angeles-rams-7-seattle-seahawks"><em>Los Angeles Rams (-7)</em> @ Seattle Seahawks</h5>

<p>This may be my shakiest pick. Even my Elo model is screaming for me to side with the Seahawks here.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way that hot teams are hot for a reason. Every season, we have at least one team catch fire and burn through opposing teams on their schedule, covering spreads repeatedly in the process. The Panthers pulled this feat off three years ago. Then the Cowboys were the &ldquo;it&rdquo; team two years ago. And then the Eagles were the hot team last year. Now the Rams look to be that team spitting hot fire this year. And I hope this team steamrolls a Seahawks defense that&rsquo;s clearly in a rebuilding phase. Sure, Russell Wilson and his skill players can step up and start notching points on the scoreboard to keep up with the Rams, but that offense under Schotty looks&hellip;lost. It doesn&rsquo;t have that same scrappy attitude that I&rsquo;ve seen from the past couple years. And that bodes well for my Rams pick here!</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="minnesota-vikings-philadelphia-eagles-3">Minnesota Vikings @ <em>Philadelphia Eagles (-3)</em></h5>

<p>On the other hand, this is my <strong><em>best</em></strong> pick this week. I&rsquo;m so confident in this pick that I&rsquo;ll be betting more than five units on this.</p>

<p>Literally, little has changed between these two teams since their postseason meeting last year. The only real change is at quarterback. Whereas the Eagles are fielding a better passer this time around in Carson Wentz, the Vikings have slid backwards a bit with Kirk Cousins helming the offense. Think about that - despite starting a lesser quarterback, the Eagles managed to blow the Vikings out last season.</p>

<p>And now, the Eagles are only laying a field goal here, even though Philadelphia will now be the team fielding the better passer. On top of that, the Eagles are coming back home off an emotional loss, which makes this a great spot for them.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="dallas-cowboys-houston-texans-3">Dallas Cowboys @ <em>Houston Texans (-3)</em></h5>

<p>The Cowboys and Texans are meeting in an exciting match, at least to me.</p>

<p>To my surprise, people seem to be taking the Cowboys&rsquo; prospects seriously in this match-up. And I don&rsquo;t know why. Yes, the Cowboys have the better defense here, but the Texans feature the <em>better quarterback</em> here. And playing on home field in primetime should juice up that Texans pass rush, which should hopefully mask the deficiencies in their defensive backfield. Then again, even if Houston was fielding corpses to man the secondary, does it honestly even matter? Dak Prescott and his wide receivers have yet to discover a consistent passing game.</p>

<p>Ezekiel Elliott will find ways to eat up yards in this game. But it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine a runningback alone keeping his team in contention. Maybe the Cowboys defense steps up and keeps the Texans attack at bay. But at home in primetime, I&rsquo;m willing to put money on Houston.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="washington-redskins-6-5-new-orleans-saints"><em>Washington Redskins</em> <em>(+6.5)</em> @ New Orleans Saints</h5>

<p>Frankly, the Redskins may be too undervalued here. I understand the Saints are a highly proficient team on offense, but the team showed some limits on offense last week against the Giants. Don&rsquo;t let their score fool you - the Saints were largely bottled up for much of the game. It was only from Alvin Kamara&rsquo;s heroics that the Saints were able to drive the score upwards. Michael Thomas spent a good bit of the game bracketed in coverage, leaving Brees without much in terms of receivers. Drew Brees is relying on Michael Thomas as a crutch. So long as Washington can blanket Thomas, Brees will struggle at points.</p>

<p>More importantly, Washington (under Jay Gruden) has a bit of a tendency to respond well when they&rsquo;re big underdogs. Considering that this is a primetime match-up, I expect the Redskins to be more than ready for the Saints in this game. A win may be a stretch, but a cover here looks good to me.</p>
