				<h2 id="vikings-giants">Vikings @ Giants</h2>

<p>Zimmer cannot still shake off his pathological conservative nature on offense. On a 3rd &amp; 20 play in the red zone, Zimmer opted for the shotgun draw.</p>

<p>Jabrill Peppers has been beastly against the run today.</p>

<p>Giants zone defense is simply lousy, as expected.</p>

<p>Dalvin Cook is something special.</p>

<p>Daniel Jones seems to genuinely enjoy throwing outside the numbers, even against tight coverage. The Giants need more X-style receivers that could catch those contested balls.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="packers-cowboys">Packers @ Cowboys</h2>

<p>Read-option slants aren&rsquo;t the best option against man coverage, Cowboys.</p>

<p>The Packers two starting cornerbacks (Jaire Alexander and Kevin King) along with the team&rsquo;s two starting edge rushers (Preston Smith and Za&rsquo;Darius Smith) are truly something. Those four players form the foundation for one of the NFL&rsquo;s better defenses.</p>

<p>The Packers defense has an affinity for dime coverages on passing downs, leaving them a little vulnerable against opposing rushers. If only the Cowboys recognized this&hellip;</p>

<p>Garrett has little juice.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="colts-chiefs">Colts @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Colts have a hard time working out of negative game script.</p>

<p>Colts are shameless in their commitment to the run, but it&rsquo;s working. The Chiefs and their scrub defense are no match for a cohesive Indianapolis front - the Colts offensive line are winning the battle in the trenches.</p>

<p>Mahomes is stripped of his magic due to a limp. He&rsquo;s still making some pretty passes though.</p>

<p>Frank Reich is one of the best coaches in the league. To take a team decimated by injuries into incredibly hostile territory and to win outright as double-digit underdogs is impressive.</p>

<hr />
