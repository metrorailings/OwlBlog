				<h5 id="49ers-rams-3">49ers @ <em>Rams</em> (-3)</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little alarming to me that the books consider the 49ers and the Rams as (more or less) equal. One team has a better quarterback than the other. And that should make the difference here, more or less.</p>

<p>I see Wade Phillips stacking the box in order to stop the run game. Sure, his defensive backs will be left on their own against the 49ers&rsquo; skill players, but that&rsquo;s a gamble I&rsquo;m sure Wade is willing to take. The combination of Marcus Peters, Aqib Talib, Eric Weddle, and Taylor Rapp should be enough to keep an underperforming quarterback at bay.</p>

<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s defense will likely follow what other teams have done and try to stack the line of scrimmage in order to prevent the Rams from running their outside zone scheme. And sure, that&rsquo;ll work. But McVay&rsquo;s unit has still made a little hay in the run game, simply by running between the tackles instead. So Los Angeles has a workaround here that should help them sustain drives, even against the 49ers stout defensive front.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="seahawks-browns-1-5">Seahawks @ <em>Browns</em> (+1.5)</h5>

<p>The Browns have no business winning this game, according to the metrics. And yet, Freddie Kitchens and his team of characters will find a way to steal a win here and keep their Super Bowl delusions alive.</p>

<p>The reality here is that as bad as Freddie Kitchens has been so far this season, Pete Carroll hasn&rsquo;t been that much better. The Seahawks&rsquo; head coach has likely grown too old for the game - his approach is a little too stubborn and outdated for today&rsquo;s game. Teams shouldn&rsquo;t be emphasizing the run game over the pass game anymore. And yet, Carroll (and Zimmer) seem to think otherwise.</p>

<p>So give me the desperate (but not completely inept) Freddie Kitchens here over the aging Pete Carroll and a Seahawks team traveling across two time zones. It also helps that Steve Wilks has considerable experience facing off against this Seahawks team.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="texans-chiefs-4-5">Texans @ <em>Chiefs</em> (-4.5)</h5>

<p>A little bit of a risky pick given Deshaun Watson and his penchant for late game heroic. But a Chiefs team coming off a loss and expecting the return of its deep threat in Tyreek Hill gives me faith here.</p>

<p>What really sells me on this pick is that Andy Reid faced off against this Texans squad just 2 years back. In that game, Alex Smith had a ball of a time throwing dimes all over the field against a weak Houston secondary. Fast forward to now and not much has changed. Houston&rsquo;s defense is still pathetic in the backfield. Romeo Crennel hasn&rsquo;t really changed his coverage schemes much. And I expect that to bite them in the ass yet again in Arrowhead.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>On second thought, after watching tape of that game back in 2017, I&rsquo;m not so impressed by the Chiefs&rsquo; offense against the Texans defense. Despite losing two of its three best pass rushers early in the game, Houston was able to force Kansas City into a number of third-and-long situations. The problem  was that the Chiefs were able to convert on most of those plays, despite the odds being against them. Some of those conversions came because of soft coverage on the part of the Texans, but other conversions came thanks to some great improvisational play by Alex Smith and Travis Kelce being a one-man wrecking crew. Either way, Kansas City&rsquo;s largely owes its offensive success to some terrific performances by a few key players - strategy only amounted to so much. Andy Reid doesn&rsquo;t have the Texans figured out like I originally assumed.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="eagles-vikings-3"><em>Eagles</em> @ Vikings (-3)</h5>

<p>The Vikings are just <em>so</em> damn childish with their emphasis on running the ball on early downs. And it&rsquo;s this stubborn devotion to the run that&rsquo;ll be their undoing against teams that can adapt against formulaic opponents. The Eagles under Jim Schwartz and Doug Pederson are one of those teams.</p>

<p>Besides, I&rsquo;d rather trust Carson Wentz over Kirk Cousins.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="titans-broncos-2">Titans @ <em>Broncos</em> (-2)</h5>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m falling for a trap here, but the Broncos being such short favorites against another formulaic team in the Titans seems wrong to me. Granted, the Broncos defense isn&rsquo;t built as well as the Bills defense that stoned the Tennessee offense last week, but Vic Fangio should prepare this team well against a Titans team that identifies as a run-first unit.</p>
