				<h4 id="patriots-jets-9-5">Patriots @ <em>Jets</em> (+9.5)</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard going against the Patriots here, but give me a Jets team that found a second life with the return of Sam Darnold last week. It also helps that C.J. Mosley <em>should</em> be coming back into the fold here after spending the last several weeks sidelined with injury.</p>

<p>Besides, it helps that New York&rsquo;s coaches should be better prepared in this match, having faced off against New England just a few weeks ago. On the flip side, the Patriots will have a harder time preparing for a Jets team with a new signal caller that hasn&rsquo;t played much this year.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="vikings-lions-1">Vikings @ <em>Lions</em> (+1)</h4>

<p>Kirk Cousins has been having a few good weeks, but I expect his run to end against a Lions team that can hold up respectably against a good passing game. In fact, Detroit has become one of the best overall teams in the league this year, with little fanfare. The Lions&rsquo; defensive backs should be able to limit Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielan in man coverage. Likewise, Stafford&rsquo;s tendency to throw beyond the sticks should fare well against a Vikings defensive backfield that&rsquo;s lost some of its edge this year.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="texans-colts-1"><em>Texans</em> @ Colts (-1)</h4>

<p>Even though these Texans were spanked by the Colts in their most recent match-up, I feel it&rsquo;s not fair to lay the entire blame for that loss at Bill O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s feet. Sure, his coaching was pretty suspect last season, but Watson was clearly wrecked with anxiety during his playoff debut. His shaky nerves reared itself at the worst moments.</p>

<p>But if you go back further than that and look at the two games between these teams during the regular season, both teams are closer to one another than the coaching disparities would otherwise indicate. And this year, it&rsquo;s fair to say the Texans have dramatically improved while the Colts are struggling to string winning performances together with Jacoby Brissett helming their offense. Houston&rsquo;s improvements have come largely on coaching and the injury front, both areas that held the team back last year.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="chargers-titans-2-5">Chargers @ <em>Titans</em> (-2.5)</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little odd for me to be favoring a team with a questionable quarterback situation, especially against a respected veteran like Philip Rivers. But the reality is that these Chargers are a lame bunch. Nothing sums up their hopelessness better than the fact that their defense leads the league in missed tackles. It&rsquo;s a stat that highlights their laziness and shoddy play.</p>

<p>And even Philip Rivers could only do so much - last week, the Chargers lost at home against a Steelers team led by a third-string quarterback whose best quality may be his duck calling. And this week, the Chargers have to travel across three time zones to face off against one of the league&rsquo;s best defenses. I don&rsquo;t expect a pretty game, but I do see Ryan Tannehill stringing together enough plays and doing just enough to lead these Titans to a much-needed win.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="rams-falcons-3"><em>Rams</em> @ Falcons (+3)</h4>

<p>Why am I taking these Rams again? The 49ers exposed the fraudulent nature of this team just last week.</p>

<p>But unlike San Francisco, Atlanta lacks the defensive horsepower to really limit the Rams&rsquo; offensive schemes. Even if Atlanta adopts the same strategy most other defenses have been using against the Rams, the defense lacks the talent up front to really limit any gains Los Angeles can make.</p>

<p>Besides, both teams are playing in desperation mode. While Dan Quinn probably has more on the line here than Sean McVay, I trust McVay more in this spot to adjust accordingly and lead his team to victory.</p>
