				<h2 id="texans-jaguars-london">Texans @ Jaguars (London)</h2>

<p>Leonard Fournette being a power runner doesn&rsquo;t bode well for a Jaguars team playing from behind.</p>

<p>Remind me to never side with a rookie quarterback in his second outing against a division opponent. The Texans are not getting any pressure on Minshew, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter as Houston seems to have gotten a beat on the Jaguars passing tendencies. The Texans&rsquo; coverage schemes are taking away many of the offensive concepts Minshew has gotten comfortable executing. Without those easy throws, Minshew is left spooked.</p>

<p>Then again, it also hurts that Minshew is lacking a playmaker in Dede Westbrook today.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="colts-steelers">Colts @ Steelers</h2>

<p>Jabaal Sheard may be the Colts&rsquo; best defensive linemen. Making stops against the run and against 4th down trick plays too.</p>

<p>The Colts offensive line is incredibly dominant. The Steelers pass rush is nearly nonexistent. Brian Hoyer is being given too much time to pick apart the Steelers zone defense.</p>

<p>Zone defense is too risky when you don&rsquo;t have the horses to execute that style of defense. And the Colts matriculating the ball downfield with ease tells me that the Steelers don&rsquo;t have those horses.</p>

<p>The Colts defense played so well on the last drive, forcing the Steelers into short passes that essentially drained clock. Had it not been for an overzealous Darius Leonard, the Steelers would have done nothing on that last drive. Frank reich and Matt Eburfleus have this team excellently coached.</p>

<p>Calling more blitzes in the second half will be the key difference for the Steelers should they pull out the win here. Still, their offensive play-calling is not helping matters either today. Randy Fichtner picks the wrong times to be conservative. Not to mention some of his play-calls have been less than inspiring.</p>

<p>This Steelers team is so frustrating. It&rsquo;s no wonder why Pittsburgh has only won against losing teams and have yet to claim victory against winning teams before today. It seems Pittsburgh is a team trying to show itself to be more talented than they actually are.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="buccaneers-seahawks">Buccaneers @ Seahawks</h2>

<p>Not much of a surprise, but Jameis genuinely plays better against teams not as familiar with him.</p>

<p>It also helps that the Seahawks are unable to generate any pressure with their pass rushing specialists alone. Having to resort to the blitz leaves passing lanes open that Jameis can exploit more often than not.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Seahawks decide to throw some big passes on a drive that could have been a closing drive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="browns-broncos">Browns @ Broncos</h2>

<p>Broncos are mercilessly killing this Browns defense on one drive using heavy play action on multiple first downs.</p>

<p>Browns tackling is absolutely sloppy. Why did I take this team again as road favorites? Never take bad teams on the road, especially when they&rsquo;re giving points to the other side.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-chiefs">Vikings @ Chiefs</h2>

<p>Tyreek Hill&rsquo;s ability to beat bracket coverage is really something. Kudos to Matt Moore for throwing a good pass.</p>

<p>Cousins is not as effective as he was the last three weeks.</p>

<p>The Chiefs have done an excellent job bottling up the run so far in the first quarter. In fact, something tells me the defense has gotten a beat on the way the Vikings run the football.</p>

<p>Solid defensive play-calling to kill a Chiefs drive late in the game. Sending more men over the weak side of the line ended up putting a good bit more pressure on Matt Moore.</p>

<p>The Vikings defense has hit home a few times when it comes to pressuring the passer, but Matt Moore threw two key balls over to Tyreek Hill on a drive that ended in a critical field goal. Tyreek Hill is a game-changer.</p>

<p>The Chiefs defensive tackles are consistently winning their battles against the interior of the Vikings offensive line.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-panthers">Titans @ Panthers</h2>

<p>Panthers are horrid at defending against the run.</p>

<p>The interior of the Titans offensive line may be a point of weakness.</p>

<p>Solid coverage by the Panthers defensive backs.</p>

<p>Tennessee&rsquo;s defense on the other hand leaves much to be desired. Being gifted a few interceptions by Jameis Winston last week seems to have left them overconfident. The only good thing the defense is doing is getting pressure on the quarterback. Yet that pressure means little if you let the Panthers convert on downs like 3rd and 14. The worst part is that Carolina moved the chains on that down with a wide receiver screen that was only designed to net several yards and set up an easier field goal.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="lions-raiders">Lions @ Raiders</h2>

<p>So far on this Lions first drive, Detroit is cutting through this Oakland defense like swiss cheese.</p>
