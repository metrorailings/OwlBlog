				<h5 id="texans-jaguars-1">Texans @ <em>Jaguars</em> (+1)</h5>

<p>I have faith in Gardner Minshew and the Jaguars offense finding some success here in their second home against a Texans defense missing its best playmaker in J.J. Watt.</p>

<p>I am worried about the Jaguars and their porous coverage schemes here. Their soft zone defense can be picked apart by good quarterbacks. And given Watson&rsquo;s ability to run the ball, that would expose this questionable defense even more. But the defensive line simply needs to step up and mow down this offensive line should they want a definite victory here.</p>

<h5 id="colts-steelers-1">Colts @ <em>Steelers</em> (+1)</h5>

<p>The Steelers impressed me last week with a solid performance against the Dolphins after coming out of their bye week a little hungover. Mason Rudolph, just weeks removed from a debilitating concussion, was smartly throwing the ball deep against a Miami defense that is simply unable to defend the pass. Had it not been for early game rust, the Steelers would have covered the double-digit spread with ease.</p>

<p>The Colts have gotten by at this point by having built a solid infrastructure around a careful Jacoby Brissett. It&rsquo;s the robustness of their roster that has enabled them to squeak out wins this seasons.  But without T.Y. Hilton, the margin for error has gotten so much more slimmer for this team. And I expect the Colts to make a few mistakes against one of the NFL&rsquo;s better defensive lines playing on their own home turf.</p>
