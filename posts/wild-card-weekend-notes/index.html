				<p>This shit just don&rsquo;t make no sense. It really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="titans-patriots">Titans @ Patriots</h2>

<p>It seems Tennessee&rsquo;s success on defense came mostly against short-yardage situations and trick plays. The Titans knew the Patriots playbook on those plays - Vrabel leveraged the knowledge he had of New England&rsquo;s habits in these scenarios. Perhaps it&rsquo;s no wonder that Belichick has such a poor record against his assistant coaches compared to his overall record - these coaches know his habits and thought process and know the proper plays to counter them.</p>

<p>If I knew this better, I would have classified the Titans as defensively chess-minded for this game. And that designation would have been enough for me to think twice about taking a side on this game.</p>

<p>And I will never understand why the Patriots were so intent on shutting down the Titans air game early on, despite Ryan Tannehill having a documented history of failure at Gillette Stadium. Derrick Henry is the heart and soul of the offense too - shutting him down early would have forced the Titans to play out of their groove. Steve and Bill Belichick have disappointed me.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vikings-saints">Vikings @ Saints</h2>

<p>It seems evident to me that the Saints phoned this game in. Even though pound-for-pound the Saints are the better team, New Orleans was not fully committed to winning this game, instead possibly looking ahead to the Packers or even the 49ers.</p>

<p>Tackling was poor. The pass rush was nonexistent. Will Lutz missed a kick. Offensive linemen were losing their battles in the trenches. Only Trey Hendricksen and and Taysom Hill seem to have shown up here.</p>

<p>Kevin Stefanski needs to be given credit here though for his playcalling. His plays have made some excellent use of pre-snap motion to throw this Saints defense off their scent. The Vikings also used the Saints initial reads against them on occasion with some great success.</p>

<p>Drew Brees is not an elite quarterback. His arm strength has waned with age. Even if the mind and improvisational skill is there, the physical tools are limited.</p>
