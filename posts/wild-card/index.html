				<h3 id="colts-texans-1">Colts @ Texans (-1)</h3>

<p>Loving the Texans here. The Texans are the team with more talent, more playoff experience, and home field advantage. Houston <em>should</em> win rather commandingly here.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Texans (ML)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="seahawks-cowboys-2-5">Seahawks @ Cowboys (-2.5)</h3>

<p>Both teams are roughly even on defense. However, the Cowboys are playing with home field advantage, whereas the Seahawks come into this contest with an elite quarterback and a more dynamic offense. Not quite certain what will play a bigger role in this game, but the Seahawks carry another advantage over the Cowboys here - coaching. Pete Carroll is the craftier coach in this match-up.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Seahawks (+2.5)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="chargers-ravens-3">Chargers @ Ravens (-3)</h3>

<p>The hardest game for me to predict this week. Both defenses are stocked with talent. Yes, the Chargers bring a far better quarterback to the table, but the Ravens offense have more weapons with which to attack <del>Los Angeles</del> San Diego&rsquo;s defense. But in the end, what should make all the difference in the world here is that this game is taking place in Maryland instead of Los Angeles.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Ravens (ML)</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="eagles-bears-6-5">Eagles @ Bears (-6.5)</h3>

<p>My other favorite pick this week will be the Eagles. Yes, the Bears have had an outstanding season. But the lack of playoff experience and the liability playing at quarterback will drag them back, especially against a team as stacked as the Eagles.</p>

<p><strong>Pick: Eagles (+6.5)</strong></p>
